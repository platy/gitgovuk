<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide will help transport organisations in England understand how to provide safer workplaces and services for themselves, their workers and passengers. It outlines measures to assess and address the risks of coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>).</p>

<p>There is also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">guidance for passengers on how to travel safely</a>. Passengers are advised to check with operators over any policies they may have put in place before travelling.</p>

<p>Transport operators linked to the visitor economy sector, such as coach tour operators and those involved with private aircraft and boat hire, should read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/the-visitor-economy#sec-2-1" class="govuk-link">visitor economy guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-taxis-and-phvs" class="govuk-link">guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle drivers, operators and owners</a>.</p>

<p>This guide and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers">safer travel for passenger guidance</a> should be followed by employers, workers and passengers even if they have received a vaccine, as it could still be possible to spread <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> to others.</p>

<p>Operators should make themselves aware of the rules that could impact cross-border services and where possible inform passengers.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Check the guidance for other UK nations: <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/coronavirus-safer-transport-guidance-operators">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/transport-transition-plan/guidance-for-transport-operators" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/restarting-public-transport-guidance-operators">Wales</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Each organisation will need to translate the principles and examples in this guidance into specific actions. Transport providers should remain mindful of their obligations under health and safety, equalities and employment legislation. Transport providers should try to coordinate their planning and actions with other providers.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>Under applicable health and safety law, transport operators, as employers, and employers of those who work out of vehicles, must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p>This includes risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and put in place sufficient control measures to manage the risk may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">risk assessment tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You should review your risk assessment regularly to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate.</p>

<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) also has guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workingsafely" class="govuk-link">how a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risk assessment can be undertaken</a>.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have fewer than 5 workers</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<p>All existing non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> related health and safety requirements continue to apply. For example, where personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is used to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, it should continue to be used. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive</a> and other transport regulators can help you comply with health and safety legislation.</p>

<h3>Consult your workers</h3>

<p>You have a duty to consult workers on health and safety. Workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership. You should encourage workers to identify, speak up and provide feedback on risks and control measures.</p>

<p>You can consult workers by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives, or with a representative chosen by workers.</p>

<p>To support workers in high risk groups, you should discuss any concerns individuals may have around their particular circumstances and reassure them about the protective measures in place. Information from  the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) can be used to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">identify high risk groups</a>. The Health and Safety Executive has further information on <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" rel="external" class="govuk-link">how to protect vulnerable workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You should share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, consider publishing the results on your website to show workers, passengers and customers that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>properly assessed their risk</li>
  <li>taken appropriate measures to mitigate this</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessible transport</h2>

<p>Operators running passenger services need to consider accessibility at every stage of the passenger journey. Passenger assistance should be a normal part of the offering that passengers can request at the point of need. Service providers have duties to ensure individuals with protected characteristics, for example, people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women, are able to access transport networks. Everyone should be supported to access transport.</p>

<p>All equality and discrimination law continues to apply. All disability rights continue to apply to trains, buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, ferries, airports and airlines, and all staff and contractors, including those who are self-employed, have duties to ensure that those with protected characteristics, for example, people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women, are able to access services.</p>

<p>As an operator running passenger services, you need to ensure that the actions taken as a result of the risk assessment do not disproportionately impact those with protected characteristics. You should provide staff with disability, equality and awareness training in line with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy" class="govuk-link">inclusive transport strategy</a>.</p>

<h2>Who should be at work</h2>

<p>Employers should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Employers should remain responsive to workers’ needs, especially with regard to scheduling vaccinations or booster doses. Employers should adopt practices that help to reduce the risks to individuals in the workplace.</p>

<h3>Workers with protected characteristics</h3>

<p>As for any workplace risk, you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics. It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of their age, sex, disability, race or other protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Read the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights">guidance on discrimination</a></p>

<p>As an employer, you have particular responsibilities towards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customers and passengers with disabilities</li>
  <li>workers with disabilities</li>
  <li>expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider providing support for workers around mental health and wellbeing. This could include guidance or telephone support, for example.</p>

<h3>People who need to self-isolate</h3>

<p>As an employer you should enable workers to work from home while self-isolating if appropriate.</p>

<p>It’s illegal to knowingly allow someone who is required to self-isolate to come to work.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>See current guidance related to statutory sick pay due to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay">statutory sick pay for employers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">statutory sick pay for employees</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing outbreaks in the workplace</h3>

<p>Make sure your risk assessment includes an up-to-date plan in case there is a <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> outbreak. This plan should nominate a single point of contact (<abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>) where possible. The <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> should lead on contacting local Public Health teams.</p>

<p>If you become aware of any positive cases of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in your workplace, you should inform your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local authority public health team</a>.</p>

<p>You should immediately identify any close workplace contacts and ask them to self-isolate, if required to. You should not wait for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace. This prompt action will help reduce the risk of a workplace outbreak.</p>

<p>If the local <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> health protection team declares an outbreak, you will be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record details of staff with symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>
</li>
  <li>assist with identifying contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>You should therefore ensure all employment records are up to date. You will be provided with information about the outbreak management process. This will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implement control measures</li>
  <li>assist with communications to staff</li>
  <li>reinforce prevention messages</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> testing for workers</h2>

<p>Anyone with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> symptoms can get a free <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Employees who do not have symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> can access testing free of charge at home or at a test site. Read guidance on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/">accessing tests if you do not have symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Employers can also pay an approved provider to provide tests or run a test site for the workplace. Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests" class="govuk-link">getting <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> tests for employees</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">options for workplace testing</a> or call 119 for more information.</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>Where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is already being used in work activity to protect against non-<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> risks, it should continue to be used. Any use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be determined by an assessment of risks in the workplace.</p>

<p>Unless the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreading is very high, risk assessments should reflect the fact that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has an extremely limited role in providing extra protection.</p>

<p>If a risk assessment does show that personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is required, then it must be provided free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided must fit properly.</p>

<p>Advice for workers and employers in non-clinical settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-strategy-stabilise-and-build-resilience"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> plan</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person.</p>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>When people choose to wear a face covering, it should fit tightly around their nose and mouth and contain multiple layers. Wearing the highest quality face covering available to them will provide greater protection.</p>

<p>If a face covering is worn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to wash or sanitise hands before and after touching the face covering</li>
  <li>use a ‘black bag’ waste bin or litter bin to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste">dispose</a> of it – face coverings should not be put in a recycling bin or be dropped as litter</li>
</ul>

<p>Be mindful and respectful of the facts that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some people are not able to wear face coverings and the reasons for this may not be visible to others</li>
  <li>a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
</ul>

<h3>Face covering use by transport workers</h3>

<p>If transport staff do wear a face covering, it is important that they follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering">guidance on face coverings</a>. You should support them in using face coverings safely.</p>

<p>Workers should be made aware face coverings can prevent some disabled people from accessing oral information and instructions (from staff and fellow passengers).</p>

<h3>Face covering use by passengers</h3>

<p>There is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with other people they do not normally meet.</p>

<p>Operators are free to set their own conditions of carriage and people should check with the operator of the service they are using before travelling.</p>

<h4>Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</h4>

<p>There may be rules for wearing face coverings for workers in other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. Check the guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-overview-and-advice" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Northern Ireland guidance</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings" rel="external">Scotland guidance</a></li>
  <li><a rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions" class="govuk-link">Wales guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ventilation</h2>

<p>Good ventilation brings fresh or cleaned air into indoor spaces. The more fresh air that is brought inside, the more diluted any airborne virus will become. In poorly ventilated spaces, residual viruses can remain in the air after an infected person has left and increase the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> spreading.</p>

<p>You should consider how to maximise the supply of fresh air in vehicles, carriages, transport hubs and office buildings.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening doors and windows to let fresh air in where possible and safe to do so</li>
  <li>ensuring that your systems are set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation, if you use mechanical ventilation</li>
  <li>air conditioning – air conditioning systems may not need adjustment, further 
advice should be sought from heating ventilation and air conditioning (<abbr title="Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning">HVAC</abbr>) engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>When conducting a risk assessment, identify areas in the workplace that are usually occupied and poorly ventilated. These areas should be prioritised for improvement before thinking about using an air cleaning device. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/air-cleaning-and-filtration-units.htm?">Further advice on air cleaning devices is available.</a></p>

<p>Further advice on ventilating buildings, including staff areas and enclosed public spaces such as waiting rooms, can be found in the HSE document <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" class="govuk-link">Ventilation and air conditioning during the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic</a>.</p>

<h2>Workforce planning</h2>

<h3>Planning for staff absence</h3>

<p>Operators should monitor staff absences as a result of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> to identify how staff absences are impacting services. Contingency planning is advised to keep transport services running at key times for people who need to travel by public transport.</p>

<h3>Protecting workers in the workplace</h3>

<p>Read the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a> for advice on how to reduce the risk of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> transmission in the workplace.</p>

<h2>Queues and protecting passenger flows</h2>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>For security searches, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> recommends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first asking passengers if they have any <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">recognised symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>that staff consider wearing gloves for each search and wash their hands as frequently as possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="#communications-and-training">staff and passenger communications</a>.</p>

<h2>Working from or out of vehicles</h2>

<p>This section is relevant to those who work from vehicles or similar environments, where the worker spends most of their daily worktime in the vehicle, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>couriers</li>
  <li>mobile workers who use their vehicle as their base location and travel to fulfil their job role</li>
  <li>lorry drivers</li>
  <li>field forces</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://n-a-s-p.co.uk/coronavirus-advice/" rel="external">Approved driving instructors can obtain further advice from The National Associations Strategic Partnership</a>.</p>

<p>Those operating vehicles in depots warehouses or factories should also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/factories-plants-and-warehouses">follow the working safely during <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Under health and safety law employers must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#risk-assessment" class="govuk-link">Guidance relating to risk assessments should be followed</a>.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the number of people travelling in the same vehicle where possible</li>
  <li>opening windows to improve the flow of fresh air. You could also open windows and doors of vehicles to help clear the air before anyone else gets in</li>
  <li>switching on ventilation systems in vehicles- they should be set to draw in fresh and not to recirculate it.</li>
  <li>ensure vehicles are regularly cleaned, in particular between different users</li>
  <li>provide guidance to drivers and temporary staff on the steps they can take to reduce risks when travelling in a vehicle</li>
  <li>consider the needs of those with protected characteristics</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/ventilation-in-vehicles.htm" class="govuk-link">HSE guidance on ventilation and air conditioning for more information on ventilation in vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>For those working from vehicles in non-public transport settings there is guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-4-1" class="govuk-link">reducing the number of people workers come in contact with, where possible</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-7-2" class="govuk-link">face coverings</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Emergency incidents</h2>

<h3>Emergency procedures</h3>

<p>Ensure that emergency procedures are followed during an emergency or situation requiring an evacuation. Review and update existing queuing, crowd management and emergency plans and the situations when these are instigated.</p>

<h3>What to do if someone develops symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in a transport setting</h3>

<p>If anyone becomes unwell with the symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> in a transport setting, they should be sent home and advised to follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#get-tested-and-self-isolate" class="govuk-link">Workers and employers should follow guidance on testing and when to self-isolate</a>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to close the transport setting or send any staff home.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>You should follow guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning and waste disposal</a>.</p>

<h3>Cleaning before increasing capacity</h3>

<p>You should ensure that any site or location that has been closed or kept partially open during the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> outbreak is assessed and appropriate steps taken to prepare for increased capacity or ongoing operation.</p>

<h3>Keeping public and private areas and modes of transport clean</h3>

<p>Keep public and private areas and vehicles clean and prevent the transmission of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> as a result of touching contaminated surfaces.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cleaning regularly-touched objects and surfaces (like door handles, handrails and ticket machines) more often than usual using standard cleaning products</li>
  <li>cleaning all workstations, shared vehicles, hand tools, controls, machinery and equipment after use and between each shift and user</li>
  <li>retaining sufficient quantities of hand sanitiser/wipes within vehicles to enable workers to clean hands after each delivery/drop-off</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hygiene – hand-washing, sanitation facilities, toilets and showers</h3>

<p>To help workers and passengers maintain good hygiene, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing hand sanitisation and hand washing facilities at various points throughout transport hubs if possible, and encouraging regular use by passengers</li>
  <li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning for facilities, especially those that are heavily used</li>
  <li>keeping facilities well ventilated, for example, by fixing doors open where appropriate</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection and disposal</li>
  <li>provide extra ‘black bag’ waste bins or litter bins for customers to throw away face coverings – staff and passengers should not use a recycling bin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communications and training</h2>

<p>Transport operators should keep workers and passengers informed of the latest <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> related safety procedures. You should share the government’s most recent guidance to all workers and organise training sessions on how to work or interact safely with colleagues and the public. Operators and businesses should carefully consider the best ways to share advice on how to travel safely to passengers.</p>

<p>For workers, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engaging with workers through unions, work councils and other workers’ bodies to quickly explain and agree any changes in working arrangements</li>
  <li>letting workers know in advance if they are required to travel or not</li>
  <li>clear and regular communication to improve understanding and consistency of how ways of working are applied</li>
  <li>communication and training materials on new procedures
    <ul>
      <li>training should include disability, equality and awareness training</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>using posters and announcements to remind workers to wash their hands often and follow general hygiene advice</li>
  <li>awareness and focus on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/">importance of mental health at times of uncertainty</a>
</li>
  <li>the use of visual and digital communications (for example, whiteboards, signs, websites, intranets, emails) to explain changes to schedules, breakdowns, materials shortages without the need for face-to-face communications</li>
  <li>providing guidance for workers assisting people with protected characteristics, for example, people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women</li>
</ul>

<p>For passengers, before travel, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising passengers of how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">travel safely</a>
</li>

  <li>sharing messages encouraging passengers to download the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> app</a> and to check in if they enter a venue during their journey that has an official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at its entrance</li>
  <li>communicating with passengers through social media and websites to help passengers prepare for their journeys and what to expect</li>
  <li>the use of simple, clear and accessible messaging to explain guidelines using images and clear language, with consideration of groups whose first language may not be English or where alternative formats may be required</li>
  <li>providing passengers with information on timetables, expected journey times, expected capacity (accounting for social distancing), delays and changes to normal routes, while requesting patience as part of messaging</li>
  <li>promoting online ticket purchases</li>
  <li>reminders to passengers to wash or sanitise their hands before and after touching their face covering</li>
  <li>information on provision and any changes to assistance services for those with protected characteristics, for example people with disabilities, the elderly and pregnant women, and how they can continue to access transport in a safe way</li>
  <li>providing clear information to the public on how this guidance is being implemented</li>
  <li>publicising cleaning regimes to instil public confidence</li>
  <li>making communications available in different formats so they are accessible to all</li>
</ul>

<p>For passengers, during travel, you could consider:</p>
