<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government has introduced new temporary measures in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) Omicron variant to slow its arrival and spread and to safeguard the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#face-coverings">Face coverings</a> are now mandatory in transport hubs and public transport, including taxis and private hire vehicles.</p>
</div>

<p>This guide will help transport organisations in England understand how to provide safer workplaces and services for themselves, their workers and passengers. It outlines measures to assess and address the risks of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>It should be read in conjunction with the current guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe" class="govuk-link">how to stay safe and prevent the spread</a> as restrictions in England have changed. There is also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">guidance for passengers on how to travel safely</a>.</p>

<p>Passengers are advised to check with operators over any policies they may have put in place before travelling.</p>

<p>Transport operators linked to the visitor economy sector, such as coach tour operators and those involved with private aircraft and boat hire, should read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/the-visitor-economy#sec-2-1" class="govuk-link">visitor economy guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-taxis-and-phvs" class="govuk-link">guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle drivers, operators and owners</a>.</p>

<p>This guide and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">safer travel for passenger guidance</a> should be followed by employers, workers and passengers even if they have received a vaccine, as it could still be possible to spread COVID-19 to others.</p>

<p>Passengers should plan ahead and ensure they understand and comply with the rules for the whole of their journey if they are crossing from England into one of the other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations. Operators should make themselves aware of the rules that could impact cross-border services and where possible inform passengers.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Check the guidance for other UK nations: <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/coronavirus-safer-transport-guidance-operators">Northern Ireland</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/transport-transition-plan/guidance-for-transport-operators" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gov.wales/restarting-public-transport-guidance-operators">Wales</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Each organisation will need to translate the principles and examples in this guidance into specific actions. Transport providers should remain mindful of their obligations under health and safety, equalities and employment legislation. Transport providers should try to coordinate their planning and actions with other providers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Operators should consider this guidance alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">advice to the public</a> that applies in England.</p>
</div>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>Under applicable health and safety law, transport operators, as employers, and employers of those who work out of vehicles, must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p>This includes risks from COVID-19. COVID-19 is a workplace hazard. You should manage it in the same way as other workplace hazards.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completing a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace</li>
  <li>identifying control measures to manage that risk</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and put in place sufficient control measures to manage the risk may be considered a breach of health and safety law.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm" class="govuk-link">risk assessment tools to support you</a>.</p>

<p>You should review your risk assessment regularly to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate.</p>

<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>) also has guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workingsafely" class="govuk-link">how a coronavirus risk assessment can be undertaken</a>.</p>

<p>You do not have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have fewer than 5 workers</li>
  <li>are self-employed</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you may still find it useful to do so.</p>

<p>Consider the following when conducting a coronavirus risk assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>risks to workers, passengers, customers and the public, along with the control measures required</li>
  <li>the impact of control measures and whether they result in additional, different risks or non-compliance with other requirements (for example health and safety or equalities legislation)</li>
  <li>applying the hierarchy of controls set out in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/contents/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999</a>
</li>
  <li>consultation with workers, or bodies representing workers, and the public</li>
  <li>the visibility of the results of any risk assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>All existing non-coronavirus related health and safety requirements continue to apply. For example, where personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is used to protect against non-coronavirus risks, it should continue to be used. The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/index.htm">Health and Safety Executive</a> and other transport regulators can help you comply with health and safety legislation.</p>

<h3>Consult your workers</h3>

<p>You have a duty to consult workers on health and safety. Workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership. You should encourage workers to identify, speak up and provide feedback on risks and control measures.</p>

<p>You can consult workers by listening and talking to them about the work they do and how you will manage the risks from COVID-19. You may do this by consulting with any recognised trade union health and safety representatives, or with a representative chosen by workers.</p>

<p>To support workers in high risk groups, you should discuss any concerns individuals may have around their particular circumstances and reassure them about the protective measures in place. Information from  the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) can be used to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">identify high risk groups</a>. The Health and Safety Executive has further information on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/protect-people.htm" class="govuk-link">how to protect vulnerable workers</a>.</p>

<h3>Sharing the results of your risk assessment</h3>

<p>You should share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce. If possible, consider publishing the results on your website to show workers, passengers and customers that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>properly assessed their risk</li>
  <li>taken appropriate measures to mitigate this</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessible transport</h2>

<p>Operators running passenger services need to consider accessibility at every stage of the passenger journey. Passenger assistance should be a normal part of the offering that passengers can request at the point of need. Service providers have duties to ensure individuals with protected characteristics, for example, disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women, are able to access transport networks. Everyone should be supported to access transport.</p>

<p>All equality and discrimination law continues to apply. All disability rights continue to apply to trains, buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, ferries, airports and airlines, and all staff and contractors, including those who are self-employed, have duties to ensure that those with protected characteristics, for example, disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women, are able to access services.</p>

<p>As an operator running passenger services, you need to ensure that the actions taken as a result of the risk assessment do not disproportionately impact those with protected characteristics. You should provide staff with disability, equality and awareness training in line with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-transport-strategy" class="govuk-link">inclusive transport strategy</a>.</p>

<h2>Who should be at work</h2>

<p>Since restrictions were relaxed in the summer, there has been a gradual return to offices and workplaces. As workers return to their workplaces, employers should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Working safely guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You should discuss a return to the workplace with workers and trade unions to make working arrangements that meet both business and individual needs.</p>

<p>Employers should remain responsive to workersâ needs, especially with regard to scheduling vaccinations or booster doses. Employers should adopt practices that help to reduce the risks to individuals in the workplace.</p>

<p>Ways of working have shifted through the pandemic and many employers are looking at future hybrid models which include an element of home working. Whatever model is chosen for the longer term, this should be discussed with those who might be affected and also with employee representatives.</p>

<p>Employers should discuss the timing and, where applicable, phasing of any return with workers. To help them feel safe returning to work, consult with them on any health and safety measures that have been put in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p>When considering workers returning to the workplace, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reflect this in your workplace risk assessment</li>
  <li>take action to manage the risk of COVID-19 spreading, in line with this guidance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workers with protected characteristics</h3>

<p>As for any workplace risk, you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics. It is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of their age, sex, disability, race or other protected characteristics.</p>

<p>Read the government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights">guidance on discrimination</a></p>

<p>As an employer, you have particular responsibilities towards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>disabled customers and passengers</li>
  <li>disabled workers</li>
  <li>expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees">See the COVID-19 advice for pregnant employees</a>.</p>

<p>Consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-review-of-disparities-in-risks-and-outcomes">emerging evidence which shows some people with particular characteristics related to age, gender, underlying health conditions, deprivation, occupation and ethnicity, may be at comparatively increased risk from COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Consider providing support for workers around mental health and wellbeing. This could include guidance or telephone support, for example.</p>

<h3>People who need to self-isolate</h3>

<p>As an employer you should enable workers to work from home while self-isolating if appropriate. Itâs illegal to knowingly allow someone who is being required to self-isolate to come to work.</p>

<p>See current guidance related to statutory sick pay due to COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay" class="govuk-link">statutory sick pay for employers</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">statutory sick pay for employees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure any workers who have symptoms of COVID-19 self-isolate immediately and request a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. If this is positive, they should continue to self-isolate for the next 10 full days, even if their symptoms are mild. This means that if, for example, their symptoms started at any time on the 15th of the month their isolation period ends at 11:59pm on the 25th.  However, if the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is negative they do not need to continue to self-isolate.</p>

<p>These symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>a loss or change in their normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia)</li>
</ul>

<p>Workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate immediately and continue for the next 10 full days.</p>

<p>Workers who test positive but have no symptoms must also self-isolate in this way. Sometimes workers develop symptoms during their isolation period. In these cases, they must restart their 10-day self-isolation period from the day after they develop symptoms.</p>

<p>Workers who have symptoms but who subsequently receive a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result are not required to self-isolate. If your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative but you still have symptoms, you may have another viral illness such as a cold, flu or a stomach bug. You should stay at home until you feel well and for at least 2 more days if you have had diarrhoea or vomiting. Seek medical attention if you are concerned about your symptoms.</p>

<p>If you are a contact of someone who has COVID-19 and you are fully vaccinated, or aged under 18 years 6 months, you are not required to self-isolate unless that person has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

<p>Find out whether workers need to self-isolate and how others can be protected if:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">they live with someone who has or might have COVID-19</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">theyâve been in contact with someone who has or might have COVID-19 but do not live with them</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If a worker gets any COVID-19 symptoms, they should self-isolate immediately and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">get a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>.</p>

<h3>Managing outbreaks in the workplace</h3>

<p>Make sure your risk assessment includes an up-to-date plan in case there is a COVID-19 outbreak. This plan should nominate a single point of contact (<abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>) where possible. The <abbr title="single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> should lead on contacting local Public Health teams.</p>

<p>If you become aware of any positive cases of COVID-19 in your workplace, you should inform your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">local authority public health team</a>.</p>

<p>You should immediately identify any close workplace contacts and ask them to self-isolate, if required to. You should not wait for <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Test and Trace. This prompt action will help reduce the risk of a workplace outbreak.</p>

<p>If the local <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> health protection team declares an outbreak, you will be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record details of staff with symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>assist with identifying contacts</li>
</ul>

<p>You should therefore ensure all employment records are up to date. You will be provided with information about the outbreak management process. This will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implement control measures</li>
  <li>assist with communications to staff</li>
  <li>reinforce prevention messages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coronavirus testing for workers</h2>

<p>Anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get a free <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Employees who do not have symptoms of COVID-19 can access testing free of charge at home or at a test site. Read guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/get-tested-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">accessing tests if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>Employers can also pay an approved provider to provide tests or run a test site for the workplace. Read guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests" class="govuk-link">getting COVID-19 tests for employees</a>.</p>

<p>Workplace testing will help identify more positive cases of COVID-19 and ensure those infected isolate. This will reduce the spread of the virus and protect those who cannot work from home and protect our vital services.</p>

<h2>Personal protective equipment</h2>

<p>Where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is already being used in work activity to protect against non-COVID-19 risks, it should continue to be used. Any use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be determined by an assessment of risks in the workplace.</p>

<p>Unless the risk of COVID-19 spreading is very high, risk assessments should reflect the fact that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has an extremely limited role in providing extra protection.</p>

<p>If a risk assessment does show that personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) is required, then it must be provided free of charge to workers who need it. Any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provided must fit properly.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is used for health and safety purposes in the workplace to protect against non-coronavirus risks, it should continue to be used.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is used, operators may want to assess their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> needs over the coming months. We would suggest regularly reviewing stock levels and consider diversifying supply chains where appropriate. The Crown Commercial Service has a <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/covid-19/covid-19-buyer-information/safer-working-supplies">framework of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> manufacturers and suppliers</a> in addition to established suppliers.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air by droplets and aerosols that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person. Face coverings are largely intended to protect others, but also provide some protection for the wearer, against the spread of infection because they cover the nose and mouth, which are the main confirmed sources of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.</p>

<p>Face coverings must be worn by passengers and users of public transport hubs and when travelling indoors on public transport in England, unless they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-covering-exemptions">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>Operators must make sure that they communicate this information, either by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>displaying appropriate notices prominently in transport hubs and, where possible, on public transport vehicles</li>
  <li>taking other appropriate measures to ensure that passengers and users of transport hubs are aware of this requirement, for example through regular public announcements, reminders delivered to individuals directly by staff and any necessary training in that regard</li>
</ul>

<p>It is advisable that operators do both of these steps, and communicate to passengers in advance of travel, where possible to promote compliance with the requirements.</p>

<p>Operators must also not prevent any person from wearing a face covering or ask them to remove it, except where briefly required to verify a personâs identity.</p>

<p>Face coverings can be sourced via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM6059:2/lot-suppliers">CCS Office Supplies framework</a> and from other suppliers.</p>

<p>When a face covering is worn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is important to wash or sanitise hands before and after touching the face covering</li>
  <li>use a âblack bagâ waste bin or litter bin to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste">dispose</a> of it â face coverings should not be put in a recycling bin or be dropped as litter</li>
</ul>

<p>Be mindful and respectful of the facts that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some people are not able to wear face coverings and the reasons for this may not be visible to others</li>
  <li>a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
</ul>

<p>Passengers who do not wear a face covering because they are <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-covering-exemptions">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a> should not be refused access to transport services.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-7-2" class="govuk-link">guidance on the use of face coverings for workplaces and those using vehicles in a non-public transport setting</a>.</p>

<h3>Face covering use by transport workers</h3>

<p>Transport workers are not required to wear a face covering, with the exception of instructors and examiners providing car, van, or HGV driving lessons or tests who are required to wear them when in the vehicle. However, face coverings offer some benefits particularly in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet.</p>

<p>Public health advice is that staff wear a face covering when they are in enclosed or crowded spaces or in passenger facing roles. For example, when providing assistance to disabled passengers. It is recognised that there will be exceptional circumstances when a staff member cannot wear a face covering, or when their task makes it sensible (based on a risk assessment) for them not to wear a face covering.</p>

<p>If transport staff do wear a face covering, it is important that they follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#how-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">guidance on face coverings</a>. You should support them in using face coverings safely. This means telling workers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it</li>
  <li>avoid touching their face or face covering, to prevent contamination with germs from their hands â this is particularly important</li>
  <li>change their face covering if it becomes damp or if theyâve touched it</li>
  <li>continue to wash their hands regularly</li>
  <li>change and wash their face covering daily</li>
  <li>if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturerâs instructions â if itâs not washable, dispose of it safely</li>
  <li>use a âblack bagâ waste bin or litter bin to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-disposing-of-waste">dispose</a> of it â face coverings should not be put in a recycling bin or be dropped as litter</li>
</ul>

<p>Workers should be made aware face coverings can prevent some disabled people from accessing oral information and instructions (from staff and fellow passengers).</p>

<h4>Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</h4>

<p>The other <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> nations may have different rules for face coverings for workers:</p>

  <li><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/face-coverings-frequently-asked-questions">Wales guidance</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Face covering use by passengers</h3>

<p>The public must wear face coverings when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs in England, unless they are <a href="#face-covering-exemptions" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public transport services (including buses, coaches, trains, trams, ferries, hovercraft, cable cars, taxis and private hire vehicles) while they are in England</li>
  <li>aircraft in English airspace which took off from, or are to land at, a place in England</li>
  <li>passenger ships/vessels and hovercraft in the English territorial sea which departed from, or are to dock at, a place in England</li>
  <li>indoor transport hubs (airports, rail and tram stations and terminals, maritime ports and terminals, bus and coach stations and terminals)</li>
</ul>

<p>This requirement does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school transport services</li>
  <li>cruise ships</li>
  <li>non-public areas of transport hubs, such as offices</li>
  <li>designated hospitality settings in transport hubs or on public transport services that are wholly or mainly used for eating or drinking â this includes premises where food and drink is consumed inside transport hubs, and buffet cars or dining areas on trains</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirement does not include motorway service areas, other than those parts of the motorway service area where the requirement otherwise does apply, such as in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shops and enclosed shopping areas</li>
  <li>any premises connected to the motorway service area functioning as a transport hub from which scheduled public transport services are operating</li>
</ul>

<p>Face coverings must be worn by both the driver and the instructor/examiner in any car or small van during a professionally delivered driving lesson, a formal driving test, or during one of the practical tests for giving driving instruction, unless they are <a href="#face-covering-exemptions" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>.</p>

<p>Face coverings must be worn by both the driver and the instructor/examiner in all HGV lessons and tests, unless they are <a href="#face-covering-exemptions" class="govuk-link">exempt or have a reasonable excuse</a>. This information must be communicated to pupils/candidates and instructors/examiners.</p>

<p>Read separate guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-lessons-learning-to-drive" class="govuk-link">driving lessons and learning to drive</a>.</p>

<p>Face coverings must be put on before entering any of these settings and individuals must keep them on until they leave unless they have a reasonable excuse for removing them.</p>

<p>In other indoor settings where a face covering is not legally required, you should still continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<h3>Passenger compliance with face covering regulations on public transport services and at transport hubs</h3>

<p>The aim is to achieve high rates of compliance with wearing face coverings, rather than high rates of enforcement. The government has communications assets for operators to use and share if they wish. Operators must communicate messages regarding the use of face coverings and exemptions or reasonable excuses so that members of the public are aware of this requirement.</p>

<p>It is important that your communications with passengers, and your training for staff, sets out the list of <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-covering-exemptions">exemptions from this regulation</a>.</p>

<p>The regulations give operators (including taxi and private hire vehicle drivers) powers to deny access to their services if a passenger is not wearing a face covering, or to direct them to wear one or leave a service if they are not wearing a face covering. All transport operators can exercise these powers in substantially enclosed public areas of transport hubs. Operators have discretion over how they use these powers â you are not obliged to use them.</p>

<p>If passengers fail to comply with operatorsâ encouragement and instructions, without a legitimate <a class="govuk-link" href="#face-covering-exemptions">exemption or reasonable excuse</a> the police and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> enforcement officers have powers to issue a fixed penalty notice.</p>

<p>Where a passenger seeks to rely on an exemption from the requirement to wear a face covering, those seeking to enforce the requirement should take a proportionate approach to the evidence they require in support of that reliance. By way of example, it is not envisaged that people relying on an age, health or disability related exemption will routinely be required to produce any written evidence in support of their reliance on such an exemption or reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>People who are exempt may choose to use operator or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#documents" class="govuk-link">government issued cards or badges</a> to avoid challenge. It is important to be aware that there is no requirement to do this, and some people who qualify for an exemption or have a reasonable excuse may still choose not to.</p>

<p>Consider using this 6-step process for escalation:</p>

<h4>Operator led: 1 engage, 2 explain, 3 encourage</h4>

<p>Operators should encourage passengers to comply with the regulation through communications or direct engagement. Operators should also explain the exemptions from the requirements.</p>

<h4>Operator led: 4 enable use</h4>

<p>A face covering is covering of any type that securely covers the nose and mouth. As these can be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering" class="govuk-link">made at home</a>, the government does not expect access to them to be a significant issue. There is no requirement or expectation that operators would make face coverings available, though operators could consider doing so, for example by handing them out for free and/or providing them in vending machines.</p>

<h4>Operator led: 5 entry and exit restrictions</h4>

<p>If a passenger is not wearing a face covering, operators and their staff have powers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevent access to a public transport vehicle, including to a taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>direct a passenger to wear a face covering in a public transport vehicle, including in a taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
  <li>direct a passenger to leave a public transport vehicle, including a taxi or private hire vehicle</li>
</ul>

<p>Transport operators also have these powers in substantially enclosed public areas of  transport hubs. Operators have discretion over how they use these powers.</p>

<h4>Police led: 6 enforcement</h4>

<p>Where the above steps fail, the police and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> have the power to enforce and fine a passenger if they continue to refuse to comply.</p>

<h3>Exemptions from mandatory face coverings on transport and at transport hubs</h3>

<p>The requirement to wear a face covering when using indoor public transport services and when in indoor transport hubs in England (including on or in ferries, hovercraft, aircraft, cable cars, taxis and private hire vehicles), does not apply to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a child who is under the age of 11</li>
  <li>a person in an allocated cabin, berth or other similar accommodation</li>
  <li>a person who boards a service in a vehicle and remains in that vehicle whilst using the service, and the vehicle is not itself used for the provision of a public transport service</li>
  <li>a person who enters or is within a transport hub in a vehicle (other than a vehicle being used for the provision of a public transport service)</li>
  <li>an employee of the operator of the transport hub or the relevant public transport service who is acting in the course of their employment</li>
  <li>a constable or police community support officer acting in the course of their duty</li>
  <li>an emergency responder (other than a constable) acting in their capacity as an emergency responder</li>
  <li>a relevant official (an inspector or surveyor of ships, a person appointed by or an officer of the Health and Safety Executive, a local authority officer, a pilot of a ship, a civil aviation inspector or a border force officer) acting in the course of their employment or their duties</li>
  <li>a person providing services to, the operator of the relevant public transport service or a transport hub whilst providing those services</li>
  <li>a person who is at that time using an area in a public transport vehicle which is being used wholly or mainly by people eating, drinking or dancing, or an area in a transport hub which is being used wholly or mainly by people eating or drinking</li>
  <li>a person who is in any part of the public transport vehicle or transport hub which is not indoors</li>
</ul>

<p>The requirement to wear a face covering in substantially enclosed public areas of transport hubs or on public transport (including on or in ferries, hovercraft, aircraft, cable cars, taxis and private hire vehicles) also does not apply where a person has an exemption or a reasonable excuse not to. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where they cannot put on, wear, or remove a face covering:
    <ul>
      <li>without severe distress</li>
      <li>because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability (within the meaning of <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/6" class="govuk-link">section 6 of the Equality Act 2010</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>where they are travelling with, or providing assistance to, another person who relies on lip reading to communicate</li>
  <li>where they remove the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury, to themselves or others</li>
  <li>where they are travelling to avoid injury, or to escape a risk of harm, and do not have a face covering with them
*to receive medical treatment</li>
  <li>to eat or drink on public transport, where it is reasonably necessary to do so</li>
  <li>where they have to remove their face covering to take medication
*where they have been asked to verify their identity</li>
  <li>where they are requested to remove the face covering by a constable or other relevant person who has the power to enforce the requirement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ventilation</h2>

<p>Good ventilation brings fresh or cleaned air into indoor spaces. The more fresh air that is brought inside, the more diluted any airborne virus will become. In poorly ventilated spaces, residual viruses can remain in the air after an infected person has left and increase the risk of COVID-19 spreading.</p>

<p>You should consider how to maximise the supply of fresh air in vehicles, carriages, transport hubs and office buildings.</p>

<p>To achieve this, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>opening doors and windows to let fresh air in where possible and safe to do so</li>
  <li>ensuring that your systems are set to maximise fresh air and minimise air recirculation, if you use mechanical ventilation</li>
  <li>air conditioning â air conditioning systems may not need adjustment, further 
advice should be sought from heating ventilation and air conditioning (<abbr title="Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning">HVAC</abbr>) engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>When conducting a risk assessment, identify areas in the workplace that are usually occupied and poorly ventilated. These areas should be prioritised for improvement before thinking about using an air cleaning device. <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/air-cleaning-and-filtration-units.htm?">Further advice on air cleaning devices is available.</a></p>

<p>Further advice on ventilating buildings, including staff areas and enclosed public spaces such as waiting rooms, can be found in the HSE document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/index.htm" rel="external">Ventilation and air conditioning during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>

<h2>Workforce planning</h2>

<h3>Planning for staff absence</h3>

<p>Operators should monitor staff absences as a result of coronavirus to identify how staff absences are impacting services. Contingency planning is advised to keep transport services running at key times for people who need to travel by public transport.</p>

<h3>Protecting workers in the workplace</h3>

<p>Read the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19) for advice on how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace</a>.</p>

<h2>Queues and protecting passenger flows</h2>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>For security searches, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> recommends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first asking passengers if they have any <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link">recognised symptoms of coronavirus</a>
</li>
  <li>that staff consider wearing gloves for each search and wash their hands as frequently as possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>See <a href="#communications-and-training" class="govuk-link">staff and passenger communications</a>.</p>

<h2>Working from or out of vehicles</h2>

<p>This section is relevant to those who work from vehicles or similar environments, where the worker spends most of their daily worktime in the vehicle, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>couriers</li>
  <li>mobile workers who use their vehicle as their base location and travel to fulfil their job role</li>
  <li>lorry drivers</li>
  <li>field forces</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://n-a-s-p.co.uk/coronavirus-advice/">Approved driving instructors can obtain further advice from The National Associations Strategic Partnership</a>.</p>

<p>Those operating vehicles in depots warehouses or factories should also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/factories-plants-and-warehouses" class="govuk-link">follow the working safely during coronavirus guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Under health and safety law employers must carry out a risk assessment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#risk-assessment" class="govuk-link">Guidance relating to risk assessments should be followed</a>.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the number of people travelling in the same vehicle where possible</li>
  <li>opening windows to improve the flow of fresh air. You could also open windows and doors of vehicles to help clear the air before anyone else gets in</li>
  <li>switching on ventilation systems in vehicles- they should be set to draw in fresh and not to recirculate it.</li>
  <li>ensure vehicles are regularly cleaned, in particular between different users</li>
  <li>provide guidance to drivers and temporary staff on the steps they can take to reduce risks when travelling in a vehicle</li>
  <li>consider the needs of those with protected characteristics</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation/ventilation-in-vehicles.htm" class="govuk-link">HSE guidance on ventilation and air conditioning for more information on ventilation in vehicles</a>.</p>

<p>For those working from vehicles in non-public transport settings there is guidance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-4-1" class="govuk-link">reducing the number of people workers come in contact with, where possible</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19/offices-factories-and-labs#offices-7-2">face coverings</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If face coverings are worn they should be removed if asked by police officers and staff for identification.</p>

<h2>Emergency incidents</h2>

<h3>Emergency procedures</h3>

<p>Ensure that emergency procedures are followed during an emergency or situation requiring an evacuation. Review and update existing queuing, crowd management and emergency plans and the situations when these are instigated.</p>

<h3>What to do if someone develops symptoms of coronavirus in a transport setting</h3>

<p>If anyone becomes unwell with the symptoms of coronavirus in a transport setting, they should be sent home and advised to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>. They should also <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a test to see if they have coronavirus</a>.</p>

<p>If they need clinical advice, they should go online to <a rel="external" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> 111</a> (or call 111 if they do not have internet access). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. They should not visit the <abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr>, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.</p>

<p>If a passenger begins to develop symptoms, they should be encouraged to return home to self-isolate, minimising contact with others.</p>

<p>Workers should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell. Workers may decide to take a <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus test</a> if they have been in proximity with someone showing coronavirus symptoms.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#get-tested-and-self-isolate">Workers and employers should follow guidance on testing and when to self-isolate</a>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to close the transport setting or send any staff home.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Touch points (for example, buttons to open doors, hand rails) across the transport network should be a particular area of focus for more frequent cleaning. You should follow guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">cleaning and waste disposal</a> and implement cleaning protocols to limit coronavirus transmission and consider who will carry out the cleaning activity.</p>

<h3>Cleaning before increasing capacity</h3>

<p>You should ensure that any site or location that has been closed or kept partially open during the coronavirus outbreak is assessed and appropriate steps taken to prepare for increased capacity or ongoing operation.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conducting a working environment assessment for all sites that have been closed, before restarting work</li>
  <li>carrying out cleaning procedures, providing hand sanitiser, adjusting ventilation before restarting work</li>
  <li>using heating, ventilation and air conditioning (<abbr title="Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning">HVAC</abbr>) systems and/or opening windows and doors to encourage ventilation, where possible and safe to do so</li>
  <li>defining and communicating consistent procedures for standard and deep cleaning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keeping public and private areas and modes of transport clean</h3>

<p>Keep public and private areas and vehicles clean and prevent the transmission of coronavirus as a result of touching contaminated surfaces.</p>

<p>You could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying higher risk areas such as areas that are touched more regularly</li>
  <li>supplying standard cleaning products for regular cleaning and making sure there are adequate disposal arrangements for used cleaning products</li>
  <li>cleaning regularly-touched objects and surfaces (like door handles, handrails and ticket machines) more often than usual using standard cleaning products</li>
  <li>clearing workspaces, removing and appropriately disposing of waste and removing belongings from the work area at the end of each shift</li>
  <li>cleaning all workstations, shared vehicles, hand tools, controls, machinery and equipment after use and between each shift and user</li>
  <li>encouraging a reduction in paper-based processes and replacing these with digital no-touch forms of communication where possible</li>
  <li>encouraging workers to wash hands before boarding vehicles</li>
  <li>retaining sufficient quantities of hand sanitiser/wipes within vehicles to enable workers to clean hands after each delivery/drop-off</li>
  <li>using wipes to clean fuel pumps before and after use</li>
  <li>cleaning vehicle keys before and after handling</li>
  <li>regular cleaning of work areas consistent with published guidance</li>
  <li>deactivation of touch screen information boards</li>
</ul>

<p>To help maintain passenger confidence that they can travel safely, consider how to publicise any new cleaning processes, using in-vehicle and at station communication.</p>

<h3>Hygiene â hand-washing, sanitation facilities, toilets and showers</h3>

<p>To help workers and passengers maintain good hygiene, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using signs and messages to build awareness of:
    <ul>
      <li>good hand-washing technique and the need to increase hand-washing frequency</li>
      <li>the need to avoid touching your face</li>
      <li>to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>providing hand sanitisation and hand washing facilities at various points throughout transport hubs if possible, and encouraging regular use by passengers</li>
  <li>providing paper towels in hand washing facilities</li>
  <li>sufficient provision of hand sanitiser onsite in addition to washrooms, and for those working away from hand washing facilities</li>
  <li>configuration of toilet and shower facilities to ensure they are kept clean, with best practice handwashing followed between each use</li>
  <li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning for facilities, especially those that are heavily used</li>
  <li>keeping showers and changing rooms closed until clear use and cleaning guidance is set</li>
  <li>minimising use of portable toilets</li>
  <li>keeping facilities well ventilated, for example, by fixing doors open where appropriate</li>
  <li>putting up a visible cleaning schedule</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection and disposal</li>
  <li>provide extra âblack bagâ waste bins or litter bins for customers to throw away face coverings â staff and passengers should not use a recycling bin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communications and training</h2>

<p>Transport operators should keep workers and passengers informed of the latest coronavirus related safety procedures. You should share the governmentâs most recent guidance to all workers and organise training sessions on how to work or interact safely with colleagues and the public. Operators and businesses should carefully consider the best ways to share advice on how to travel safely to passengers.</p>

<p>For workers, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>engaging with workers through unions, work councils and other workersâ bodies to quickly explain and agree any changes in working arrangements</li>
  <li>letting workers know in advance if they are required to travel or not</li>
  <li>clear and regular communication to improve understanding and consistency of how ways of working are applied</li>
  <li>communication and training materials on new procedures
    <ul>
      <li>training should include disability, equality and awareness training</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>using posters and announcements to remind workers to wash their hands often and follow general hygiene advice</li>
  <li>awareness and focus on the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/" class="govuk-link">importance of mental health at times of uncertainty</a>
</li>
  <li>the use of visual and digital communications (for example, whiteboards, signs, websites, intranets, emails) to explain changes to schedules, breakdowns, materials shortages without the need for face-to-face communications</li>
  <li>providing guidance for workers assisting people with protected characteristics, for example, disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women</li>
</ul>

<p>For passengers, before travel, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising passengers of how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">travel safely</a>
</li>
  <li>advising passengers to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">check the current rules</a> and associated travel guidance</li>
  <li>reminding passengers of the requirement to wear a face covering when travelling inside a public transport vehicle and when in indoor transport hubs</li>
  <li>sharing messages encouraging passengers to download the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 app</a> and to check in if they enter a venue during their journey that has an official <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> COVID-19 <abbr title="quick response">QR</abbr> code poster at its entrance</li>
  <li>communicating with passengers through social media and websites to help passengers prepare for their journeys and what to expect</li>
  <li>the use of simple, clear and accessible messaging to explain guidelines using images and clear language, with consideration of groups whose first language may not be English or where alternative formats may be required</li>
  <li>providing passengers with information on timetables, expected journey times, expected capacity (accounting for social distancing), delays and changes to normal routes, while requesting patience as part of messaging</li>
  <li>promoting online ticket purchases</li>
  <li>reminders to passengers to wash or sanitise their hands before and after touching their face covering</li>
  <li>information on provision and any changes to assistance services for those with protected characteristics, for example disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women, and how they can continue to access transport in a safe way</li>
  <li>providing clear information to the public on how this guidance is being implemented</li>
  <li>publicising cleaning regimes to instil public confidence</li>
  <li>making communications available in different formats so they are accessible to all</li>
</ul>

<p>Where face coverings are legally required, operators must take reasonable steps to communicate this requirement to passengers to promote compliance with the law, either by displaying signage or taking other measures such as verbally reminding customers to wear a face covering on their premises.</p>

<p>For passengers, during travel, you could consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>displaying messages, signs and making announcements to encourage people to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers#travel-safely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak" class="govuk-link">travel safely</a>
</li>
  <li>using posters and announcements to remind travellers and passengers to wash their hands often and follow general hygiene advice, and how to dispose of face coverings safely</li>
  <li>signs and announcements to help passengers understand what they need to do to travel safely, in consultation with other operators and local authorities for public highways and thoroughfares</li>
  <li>providing clear information to the public on how this guidance is being implemented</li>
  <li>making staff available to answer questions and provide help to those unable to access other messaging, particularly if station or service availability is subject to significant change that may cause confusion</li>
  <li>ensuring existing safety messaging is increased in prominence</li>
  <li>making communications available in different formats so they are accessible to all</li>
</ul>
