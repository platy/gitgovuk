<p>Fill in box 13 of the employment pages if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re a director, or employee</li>
  <li>you bought or were given an asset because of your job</li>
</ul>

<p>If the asset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was not used</li>
  <li>has not fallen in value since the person who gave it to you acquired or produced it</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the amount that they paid for the asset minus what you paid for it in box 13. If the second-hand value (the market value of the asset when you got it) is higher, then use that amount minus what you paid for the asset.</p>

<p>If the asset:</p>

<ul>
  <li>was used</li>
  <li>has fallen in value since the person who gave it to you acquired or produced it</li>
  <li>was not previously provided as a benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the second-hand value when you got it minus what you paid for it in box 13.</p>

<p>If the asset, (other than a car, van or living accommodation) was used, or has fallen in value since the person who gave it to you acquired or produced it and was previously provided as a benefit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before 6 April 1980 - put the second-hand value of the asset when you got it minus what you paid for it, in box 13</li>
  <li>on or after 6 April 1980- use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/498883/HS213_working_sheet2016.pdf" rel="external">working sheet</a> to work out the amount to put in box 13</li>
</ul>

<p>If the asset is a bicycle, car, van or living accommodation, put the second-hand value when you got it minus what you paid for it, in box 13.</p>

<p>To find out if your asset has fallen in value, compare the market value of the asset when you got it, with the market value immediately after the person who gave it to you acquired or produced it.</p>

<p>If you got shares or options from your employer, read the additional information notes.</p>
