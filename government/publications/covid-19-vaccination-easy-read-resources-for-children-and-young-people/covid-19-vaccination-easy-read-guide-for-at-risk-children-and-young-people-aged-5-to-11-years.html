<p>This guide is for parents and carers of children aged 5 to 11 who are most likely to get very poorly from coronavirus. It includes information on coronavirus, also known as COVID-19 and the vaccine.</p>

<h2>Information on COVID-19</h2>

<p>Coronavirus is an illness that can make you poorly.</p>

<p>Most children and young people won’t have any symptoms or feel very poorly if they get coronavirus.</p>

<p>If your child catches coronavirus, they might feel like they have a bad cold.</p>

<p>A very small number of children and young people might have to go to hospital.</p>

<h2>Information on the COVID-19 vaccine</h2>

<p>The vaccine will help protect your child from getting very poorly from coronavirus.</p>

<p>It is important for your child to get the vaccine because they have a health condition. Children with a health condition are more likely to get poorly if they get coronavirus.</p>

<h4>If your child is aged 5 to 11 years old, they should have the coronavirus vaccine if they:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>are disabled in a way that affects how their brain works with their body, like having cerebral palsy or epilepsy</li>
  <li>have an immune system that doesn’t work very well. This means that their body is not able to fight off viruses and germs as well as other children’s can</li>
  <li>have a learning disability that means you need the most support. This is sometimes called a ‘severe learning disability’</li>
  <li>have Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>are on your doctor’s (<abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>) learning disability register</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not sure if they should have the vaccine, you can contact your doctor (such as your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or paediatrician). They should be able to check for you.</p>

<h4>You should not take your child for their vaccine if they are:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>staying at home because they have been around someone who has coronavirus</li>
  <li>think they might have coronavirus and are waiting for a test</li>
  <li>are feeling poorly, or if they are feeling different to how they usually feel</li>
</ul>

<h3>Doses and timing</h3>

<p>Your child will need to have 2 vaccines to keep them as safe as possible.</p>

<p>The second vaccine should be 8 weeks after your first vaccine. 8 weeks is the same as 2 months.</p>

<p>The vaccine has been tested by lots of people who have made sure that is it safe.</p>

<p>Coronavirus can make you feel very poorly. But you won’t feel as bad if you already have had the vaccine.</p>

<h3>How to book your child’s appointment</h3>

<p>You will get a letter or phone call to invite your child for their vaccine.</p>

<p>If you have not had a letter or a phone call, you can call your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> to book an appointment.</p>

<h3>When your child gets their vaccine</h3>

<p>You can talk to the nurse or the doctor who will give your child their vaccine, about any support that will help make it easier for you. This is sometimes called reasonable adjustments.</p>

<p>If you are worried about your child having the vaccine, you can talk to your doctor.</p>

<p>When your child has had their vaccine, you should be given a card which can be used to show people which vaccine your child had.</p>

<p>Keep your child’s card somewhere safe.</p>

<p>If you lose the card after your child’s first vaccine, you can still get their second vaccine.</p>

<p>They will give you another one when your child has their second vaccine.</p>

<p>It takes about 2 weeks for the vaccine to start working and give your child protection from coronavirus.</p>

<h3>After having the vaccine</h3>

<p>Their arm might feel heavy or sore.</p>

<p>Their body might ache.</p>

<p>They might feel like they have a cold or the flu.</p>

<p>They might have a headache.</p>

<p>They might feel tired.</p>

<p>They might feel very hot or very cold.</p>

<h4>If your child feels poorly, they can:</h4>

<p>Rest.</p>

<p>You can give them painkillers such as paracetamol for children.</p>

<p>They should feel better in a few days.</p>

<h4>A very small number of children may get:</h4>

<p>Problems with their heart. This can feel like your heart is beating in a different way than usual.</p>

<p>Pain in their chest.</p>

<p>Breathing problems (finding it hard to breath).</p>

<p>If you think there is a problem with their heart or breathing, you can ring 999.</p>

<p>You can also ring 111 if you are not sure what help you need. They will tell you what to do. If it is an emergency, they will be able to send an ambulance.</p>

<p>If your child feels poorly after their vaccine, you can report it using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">coronavirus yellow card website</a>. This helps find out how different people feel after the vaccine and makes sure the vaccine keeps people safe.</p>

<h2>Things you can do to keep protecting you and your child from coronavirus</h2>

<p>Help your child to wash their hands or use lots of hand sanitiser. Wash your hands at the same time. This is important when you are out and when you have just come home.</p>

<p>You don’t have to wear a mask, but it can help keep you and other people safe.</p>

<p>If you are meeting people who do not live with you, try to meet them outside.</p>

<p>There is much less chance of getting coronavirus outside.</p>

<p>If you do meet people inside, have doors and windows open so that there is more air coming in.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>There is more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external">coronavirus on NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can also get more coronavirus information by phoning 111.</p>
