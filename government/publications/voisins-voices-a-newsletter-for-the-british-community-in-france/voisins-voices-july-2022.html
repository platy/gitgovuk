<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to the July 2022 edition of Voisins Voices!</p>

<p>This edition includes our Ambassador Menna Rawlings’ video message to British nationals living in France, a recap of the past month celebrating the Platinum Jubilee and information on votes for life, UK student visas, forest fires, riptides, crossing the UK-France border during summer and support available for people experiencing domestic violence.</p>

<p>Do please forward this to any friends, family, or new acquaintances living in France.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://eepurl.com/c9wJZL" rel="external">Sign up for the newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>As always, our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-france">Living in France guide</a> has the most up to date information, whether you have lived in France for many years, or recently arrived.</p>

<h2>Menna Rawlings’ message to UK nationals</h2>

<p>Our Ambassador has recorded a video for UK nationals living in France. She talks about what we’ve been doing this past month, her support to the British community and upcoming summer holidays.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fb.watch/e2MDgBxWD_/" rel="external">You can watch the full video here</a>(Facebook).</p>

<h2>The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee</h2>

<p>In June, here at the Embassy we were busy celebrating Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee, and we know many members of the British community organised their own events too – bravo!</p>

<p>We celebrated our annual Queen’s Birthday Party, showcasing the best of the UK in terms of food, music and entertainment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://twitter.com/UKinFrance/status/1533094611735957507" rel="external">Watch our recap video here</a>(Twitter)</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ukinfrance/albums/72177720299663142" rel="external">Look at photos of the event</a>(Flickr).</p>

<p>In a special ceremony dedicated to the Queen, President Emmanuel Macron and Her Majesty’s Ambassador to France, Dame Menna Rawlings, rekindled the flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, at the Arc de Triomphe, displaying the deep bonds of friendship between the UK and France as we joined together to mark this historic occasion.</p>

<p>We also welcomed 64 British companies to the Ambassador’s residence for our So British showcase, which presented the best of the UK’s innovation to hundreds of visitors.</p>

<p>And we welcomed 300 British nationals for a Great British Tea Party in our garden with our good friend Paddington. We would like to thank everyone for joining us for such a heart-warming event and we hope to see many of you soon for more events celebrating the British community in France!</p>

<p>Follow us on social media to be the first to hear about other opportunities to visit the Residence.</p>

<h2>Menna Rawlings interview with Connexion, published 3 June 2022</h2>

<p>Dame Menna Rawlings, the UK’s first female ambassador to France, talked to Connexion about Jubilee preparations, British residency rights, migrants and President Macron.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/article/People/Interviews/UK-ambassador-to-France-shares-view-on-first-hectic-months-in-post" rel="external">You can read the full interview here</a>.</p>

<h2>President Emmanuel Macron Jubilee Message</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">To celebrate her is to honour the deep and sincere friendship between our countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Votes for life</h2>

<p>The Elections Act 2022 passed into law on 28 April.  The Act includes provisions for removing the 15-year rule and extends the franchise for UK Parliamentary Elections to all British citizens living overseas who have been previously registered or resident in the UK.</p>

<p>The Act will make it easier for expats to participate by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>enabling overseas electors to remain on the register for longer with an absent vote (postal or proxy) arrangement in place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extending the registration period for overseas electors from one year to up to three years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introducing an online absent vote application service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an enhanced postal vote system for overseas electors in GB constituencies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Changes to the franchise for overseas electors are expected to be delivered ahead of polls in spring 2024, alongside the changes to the length of absent vote arrangements and alignment of absent vote applications with declaration renewals. Individuals will apply to register at the last address at which they were registered, or, if they were never registered, at the last address at which they were resident.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-electors-delivering-votes-for-life-for-british-expatriates">Read more on this new policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Summer travel</h2>

<p>If you’re planning on traveling this summer, please be aware that the coming weeks are likely to see an increase in traffic between the UK and France on trains, planes, ferries and the Channel Tunnel, which could lead to delays at certain times.  Industrial action in France and resource constraints of travel operators could also cause further disruption.</p>

<p>Before travelling, you should check for the latest information with your travel operator or airline, including their advice on how early you should arrive at the terminal or airport to check in.</p>

<p>Where possible, you should make sure you have a confirmed booking before you travel and ensure you are fully prepared for your trip, including for the possibility of delays, with enough food and water.</p>

<h2>Student visas</h2>

<p>Planning on studying in the UK?</p>

<p>British Passport holders retain the right to return to live and study in the UK at any point in future. However, if you know any people without British nationality wishing to take up studies in the UK, this is relevant for them.</p>

<p>UK Visas and Immigration strongly recommend that students apply for their visa as early as possible as decisions are taking four weeks to process. They received high levels of applications in August so you should start to prepare and submit your application from now.
If you are waiting for your CAS reference number, you can prepare your supporting documents in the meantime.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>current passport/travel documentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances and where you are applying from, you may also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>proof of English language proficiency. This could be an IELTS test (other tests are accepted too)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>proof that you can pay for your course fees and maintenance for one academic year. The amount will depend on your personal circumstances</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consent from a parent or guardian if under 18</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>copies of your education certificates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk?fbclid=IwAR3OOfFgGuj0x-HBpNtw6lzh-qWdoXsHZDrdXK6bduJ_SXBpPC-1WLsARTk">TB test certificate</a></p>

<h2>Be aware of forest fires and riptides</h2>

<h3>Forest fires</h3>

<p>Forest fires can occur anywhere in southern France during the summer months but especially along the Mediterranean coast and in Corsica. In recent years, fires have become more frequent due to drought and high temperatures.</p>

<p>French authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety reasons. If you’re staying in a high-risk area you should familiarise yourself with the local safety and emergency procedures, be vigilant and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/en/forest-fires-and-wildfires?fbclid=IwAR0a5fX3WU_TxvwysnvrRLnMMAjaTRT7A8JNE-bcBLeRo8EjB_ypIH3MWSA" rel="external">Read information about how to stay safe</a>, provided by the French government.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Call the emergency services on 18 or 112 if you are in danger from a wild fire, or see one.</p>
</div>

<h3>Riptides</h3>

<p>If you are planning on a beach holiday on the Atlantic coast this summer, make sure you swim safe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>beware of dangerous beach currents, these can be very powerful – learn to spot a riptide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use beaches with lifeguards where possible</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>always check warning flags and signage on the beach and only swim where it is permitted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gironde.gouv.fr/Politiques-publiques/Securite/Securite-sanitaire/Prevention-baignade-en-mer" rel="external">local security advice</a> (in French)</p>

<h2>Support for victims of domestic violence</h2>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.womenforwomenfrance.org/fr/" rel="external">multilingual information portal</a> was created by Women for Women France in collaboration with 30 experts with the aim of becoming the national reference.  It contains reliable and comprehensible information for French and non-French victims of domestic violence, regardless of the language they speak and is already available in 16 languages.</p>

<p>It contains 90 practical guides that respond in a clear and precise manner to concrete concerns in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>money, housing, independence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>separation, divorce, child custody</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safety and protection orders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>physical, sexual and mental health</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>right to stay in France</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>police and justice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthcare while you travel</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Make sure you have healthcare cover before you travel</p>
</div>

<p>If you make social security contributions in France, you should be entitled to a France-issued European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and should carry this with you when travelling.</p>

<p>All EU-issued EHICs remain valid for necessary care when visiting the UK and other EU Member States. We still recommend taking out comprehensive travel insurance when travelling, including health cover, as an EHIC does not cover certain things such as repatriation.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/adresses-et-contacts/lobtention-dun-document/commander-une-carte-europeenne-dassurance-maladie-ceam" rel="external">Read more information about getting a French-issued EHIC</a>.</p>

<p>If your healthcare is covered by the UK, you should be entitled to a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Existing UK-issued EHICs also remain valid for necessary care when visiting EU Member States until the expiration date on the card. They do not need to be replaced immediately. Once it expires, it can be replaced with a new GHIC issued by the UK. Please also share this message with any visiting friends or family from the UK to France.</p>
