<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>About the licensing strategy</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>This abstraction licensing strategy (<abbr title="Abstraction Licensing Strategy">ALS</abbr>) sets out how we manage new and existing abstraction and impoundments within the East Devon catchments. It provides an overview of how water resources are sustainably managed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide water for abstraction</li>
  <li>protect the environment</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-water-abstraction">Managing water abstraction</a> provides the national framework to ensure there is enough water for the future needs of both people and the environment.  The abstraction licensing strategy is the local water resource strategy that meets those national requirements, as described in the River Basin Management Plan (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/river-basin-management-plans-2015#south-west-river-basin-district-rbmp:-2015"><abbr title="River Basin Management Plan">RBMP</abbr> 2015</a>).</p>

<p>The strategy also describes the collaboration with local partners and stakeholders undertaken to achieve sustainable management of water resources. This reflects the unique characteristics of the East Devon catchments.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/water">abstraction pages</a> on GOV.UK provides further advice on:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Collaborative and sustainable water management</h3>

<p>Our long-term goal is to develop a stronger catchment focus for water resource management throughout the East Devon catchments through collaborative working.</p>

<p>We are developing and testing innovative solutions to achieve greater access to water and address unsustainable abstraction through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/water-resources/water-resources-priority-catchments/" rel="external">priority catchment initiative</a>. We have selected priority catchments where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is unmet demand for water and/or there are concerns that abstraction is damaging the ecology</li>
  <li>there is potential for water to be shared amongst abstractors</li>
  <li>there are a number of abstractors who we can work with to trial new and innovative ways of managing water abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>The River Otter is one of the East Devon catchments and was selected as a priority catchment in 2019 through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-abstraction-plan-2017"><abbr title="Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr> water abstraction plan</a>.  See map 1.</p>

<p>By working with abstractors and catchment groups we aim to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop local solutions to existing pressures on water resources</li>
  <li>prepare for the future</li>
</ul>

<p>More details regarding the Otter priority catchment are provided in section 2.5 and section 5, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Catchment">managing the catchment together</a>.</p>

<p>The East Devon catchments cover an area of 2,271km<sup>2</sup> in south west England (map 1). It is divided into 2 areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exe catchment</li>
  <li>Otter, Sid, Axe and Lim catchment</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Environment</h3>

<p>The East Devon catchments include a diverse range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-sites-and-areas-how-to-review-planning-applications#types-of-protected-sites-and-areas">protected areas</a> of local and national environmental importance that are protected by UK law. These important grasslands, heathlands, wetlands and woodlands include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 Special Areas of Conservation (<abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>2 Special Protection Areas (<abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>60 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (<abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be viewed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx" rel="external">Magic Map</a>.</p>

<p>Many of these sites have a surface water or groundwater dependence to maintain their quality and may therefore be affected by abstraction. It is our responsibility to ensure we do not authorise abstraction that will have an adverse effect on these protected sites. Section 4.2 (Protected areas) provides information on how we manage water availability near groundwater and surface water dependent protected sites.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Water Resources</h3>

<h4>Surface Water</h4>

<p>The East Devon catchments comprise the following 5 rivers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>River Exe</li>
  <li>River Otter</li>
  <li>River Sid</li>
  <li>River Axe</li>
  <li>River Lim</li>
</ul>

<p>These emerge from high ground in the north and flow in a southerly direction towards the coast between Dawlish and Lyme Regis.</p>

<p>Under the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (<abbr title="Water Framework Directive">WFD</abbr>) a total of 81 river water bodies have been defined within the East Devon catchments. Water bodies are the surface water or groundwater units on which we carry out resource assessments.</p>

<p>In addition, there are three lake waterbodies defined in the catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Otterhead Reservoir (Otter)</li>
  <li>Squabmoor Reservoir (Otter)</li>
  <li>Wimbleball Reservoir (Exe)</li>
</ul>

<p>A total of 111 licensed surface water abstractions are currently authorised in the East Devon catchments. These licences authorise the abstraction of up to 259 million cubic metres of surface water per year.</p>

<p>Over the period 2013 to 2018 approximately 155.8 million cubic metres of surface water was abstracted from the East Devon catchments per year. This is equivalent to 60% of the total licensed surface water abstraction quantity.</p>

<p>These licence and abstraction figures do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>non-consumptive abstractions for hydroelectric power (<abbr title="Hydro-electric power">HEP</abbr>) generation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>surface water abstractions that do not require a licence</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/water#abstractions-or-impoundments-that-do-not-need-a-licence">activities that do not need an abstraction licence</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Groundwater</h4>

<p>Groundwater is stored in aquifers and provides an important water resource that can be abstracted from boreholes, wells and springs. Groundwater also interacts with rivers in important ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>groundwater emerging from springs that commonly feed the headwaters of the rivers</li>
  <li>groundwater baseflow through the riverbed that supports river flow</li>
</ul>

<p>These interactions are most important at times of low flow.</p>

<p>The diverse geology of the East Devon catchments means that groundwater is highly variable in both the quantities found and its chemical quality. A total of 15 groundwater bodies are wholly or partially present in the East Devon catchments. These groundwater bodies underlie 98% of the total catchment area.</p>

<p>The Otter Sandstone is the most important aquifer in the East Devon catchments. It is heavily utilised by South West Water to provide public water supply. It also sustains flow in the River Otter and its tributaries. The other geological formations in the East Devon catchments provide less groundwater. However, they are important in supporting river flow and smaller commercial abstractions or private water supplies.</p>

<p>Given its importance, the Otter Sandstone aquifer has also been classified a groundwater management unit (<abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr>). Computer models are often developed due to the complexity of groundwater / surface water interactions in GWMUs. A groundwater model has been developed for the Otter Valley <abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr> (see section 5.1). The Otter Valley <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr></a> has the same boundary as the Otter Valley groundwater body.</p>

<p>A total of 208 licensed groundwater abstractions are currently authorised in the East Devon catchments. These licences authorise the abstraction of up to 27.4 million cubic metres of groundwater per year. This is equivalent to approximately 10% the total licensed surface water abstraction.</p>

<p>Over the period 2013 to 2018 approximately 16.9 million cubic metres of groundwater was abstracted from the East Devon catchments per year. This is equivalent to 62% of the total licensed quantity of groundwater.</p>

<p>The proportion of groundwater abstracted by different sectors, based on total licensed quantities is summarised below:</p>

<h4>Water resource sustainability</h4>

<p>We aim to ensure the sustainable use of water resources through the resource assessment approach and tools described in section 3 and 4. We define the needs of the river ecology using the Environmental Flow Indicator (<abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where river flow is already below that needed by its ecology, we are unable to issue new abstraction licences. We may also add conditions to a licence to protect flow, ecology and other water users (see section 4). Under <abbr title="Water Framework Directive">WFD</abbr> we classify such water bodies as not supporting good status. We use surveys to understand if this reduction in flow is causing an impact on river ecology or whether it represents a future risk. Where this is the case, we would look to take action to restore flows.</p>

<p>If river flow is sufficient to maintain the long-term health of its ecology, we classify it as having Good Ecological Status (<abbr title="Good Ecological Status">GES</abbr>) under <abbr title="Water Framework Directive">WFD</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Climate change</h3>

<p>Climate change represents one of the greatest challenges for future sustainable management of water resources in the East Devon catchments. Climate change will likely impact on the quantity and seasonal availability of water resources.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The projected climate change impacts on rainfall and river flow for south west England by the 2050s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rainfall to decrease by 45% in the summer but increase by 41% in the winter</p>

  <li>
    <p>low flows to be 82% lower but peak river flows to be 40% higher</p>

<p>Climate change projections are estimated using data from UKCP09, consistent with a 4ÂºC rise by 2100. Further details on the assumptions used can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/climate-impacts-tool">Environment Agency Climate impacts tool</a>.</p>

<p>The Otter Valley groundwater model has been used to assess the impact that climate change may have on water resources.  See section 5.1 for more details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>The priority catchment initiative and partnership working</h3>

<p>The River Otter was selected as a priority catchment in 2019 as part of phase 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-abstraction-plan-2017/water-abstraction-plan#developing-a-stronger-catchment-focus"><abbr title="Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs.">Defra</abbr> water abstraction plan</a>. It was chosen as a priority catchment for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the current level of abstraction means there is insufficient water in the River Otter for wildlife, at certain times of 
the year</li>
  <li>there are several collaborative projects already underway that are evaluating innovative approaches for 
managing water resources in the catchment</li>
  <li>there is potential to share water amongst abstractors</li>
  <li>current forecasts for climate change in terms of river flows and sea level rise indicate more acute pressures on 
water resources in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>As a priority catchment, we aim to extend our work with water users and other partners to explore modern ways of managing water. We are working to build our partnership across sectors including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water companies providing public water supply</li>
  <li>agriculture</li>
  <li>the environment</li>
  <li>industry</li>
  <li>flood risk management</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this work we aim to co-develop solutions which are good for the environment, people and business.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Water resource availability in the East Devon catchments</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Resource assessment</h3>

<p>Resource assessment is at the heart of abstraction management. To manage water effectively we need to understand how much, where and when water is available, after considering the needs of the environment. The main components of this assessment are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water resource allocation for the environment defined as a proportion of natural flow, known as the 
 Environmental Flow Indicator</li>
  <li>Fully Licensed (FL) scenario - the situation if all abstraction licences were being used to their full quantity</li>
  <li>Recent Actual (RA) scenario â the amount of water actually abstracted on average over the previous 6 years</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a monitoring network to measure river flows and groundwater levels. We use this data, along with our catchment knowledge to inform the assessment.</p>

<p>River flow changes naturally throughout the year and from year to year. We need to maintain flow variability to protect the ecology of the river. We use river flow statistics to help to do this. River flow statistics are expressed as the percentage of time that a certain flow is exceeded. Resource availability is calculated at 4 specific flow regimes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q30 â the high flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 30% of the time, therefore on average you would expect the river flow to be below the Q30 for 256 days per year</li>
  <li>Q50 â the flow of a river which is exceeded on average 50% of the time, therefore on average you would expect the river flow to be below the Q50 for 183 days per year</li>
  <li>Q70 â the flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 70% of the time, therefore on average you would expect the river flow to be below the Q70 for 110 days per year</li>
  <li>Q95 â the low flow of a river which is exceeded on average for 95% of the time, therefore on average you would expect the river flow to be below the Q95 for 18 days per year</li>
</ul>

<p>This information gives a realistic picture of what the current resource availability is within a given water body.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Surface water availability</h3>

<p>The method for calculating the surface water resource availability is explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-water-abstraction">Managing water abstraction</a>. Water availability is calculated at selected <a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">assessment points</a> (APs). Within the East Devon catchments separate APs are defined for the Exe catchment and the combined Otter, Sid, Axe and Lim catchment. All APs are shown in maps 3 to 6.</p>

<p>There are 11 APs in the Exe catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1, Trews Weir (River Exe, at Exeter)</li>
  <li>AP2, Cowley (River Creedy, upstream of confluence with River Exe)</li>
  <li>AP3, North Bridge (River Exe, upstream of confluence with River Culm)</li>
  <li>AP4, Tiverton Exe (River Exe at Tiverton)</li>
  <li>AP5, Brushford (River Barle, upstream of confluence with River Exe)</li>
  <li>AP6, Weir Bridge (River Exe, upstream of confluence with River Haddeo)</li>
  <li>AP7, Tiverton Lowman (River Lowman at confluence with River Exe at Tiverton)</li>
  <li>AP8, Stoke Cannon (River Culm, at its confluence with River Exe)</li>
  <li>AP9, Woodmill (River Culm, to the south of Cullompton)</li>
  <li>AP10, Uffculme (River Culm, at Uffculme)</li>
  <li>AP11 Clyst St Mary (River Clyst, upstream of Exe Estuary at Topsham)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 9 APs in the combined Otter, Sid, Axe and Lim catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AP1, Otterton (downstream River Otter, downstream of Otterton Mill)</li>
  <li>AP2, Fairmile (River Tale, upstream of confluence with River Otter)</li>
  <li>AP3, Fenny Bridges (River Otter at Fenny Bridges)</li>
  <li>AP4, Sidmouth (Mouth of the River Sid)</li>
  <li>AP5, Colyford (River Coly, at its confluence with River Axe)</li>
  <li>AP6, Axe Bridge (downstream River Axe, upstream of Axe Estuary and confluence with River Coly)</li>
  <li>AP7, Kilmington (River Yarty, upstream of confluence with Corry Brook)</li>
  <li>AP8, Weycroft (River Axe, upstream of Axminster)</li>
  <li>AP9, Lyme Regis (Mouth of River Lim at Lyme Regis)</li>
</ul>

<p>APs have not been defined for the following rivers due to their short length:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dawlish Water (west of Exe estuary)</li>
  <li>River Ken (west of Exe estuary)</li>
  <li>Matford Brook (west of Exe estuary)</li>
  <li>Alphin Brook (west of Exe estuary)</li>
  <li>Polly Brook (east of the Exe Estuary)</li>
  <li>Branscombe Brook (west of Lyme Regis)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bespoke resource assessments will be carried out for abstraction proposals in these water bodies.</p>

<h4>Water resource availability colours and implications for licensing</h4>
<p>We use colours to represent different surface water availability at the 4 flows described in Section 3.1 -
(Q30 â high flow; Q50; Q70; and Q95 â low flow):</p>

<p><strong>Water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Green</p>
</div>

<p>There is more water than required to meet the needs of the environment. New licences can be considered depending on local and downstream impacts.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Yellow</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">Fully Licensed</a> flows fall below the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If all licensed water is abstracted there will not be enough water left to maintain a healthy ecology in the river. No new consumptive licences would be granted. It is likely weâll be taking action to reduce fully licensed risks. Water may be available if you can âbuyâ the entitlement to abstract water from an existing licence holder (known as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Manage">water rights trading</a>) although it may be for reduced quantities.</p>

<p><strong>Water not available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Red</p>
</div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">Recent Actual</a> flows are below the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Recent actual abstracted quantities are already resulting in flows below that required to maintain a healthy ecology in the river. No new consumptive licences would be granted. Any water rights trading proposal in these water bodies would need to demonstrate improvements in flow.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Groundwater resource availability</h3>

<p>Groundwater availability is a measure of how much groundwater is available for abstraction after the river flow requirements for ecology have been met.</p>

<p>Groundwater availability inside the Otter Valley <abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr> has been assessed using the Otter Valley groundwater model.  See section 5.1 for more details.</p>

<p>Outside of the Otter Valley <abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr>, groundwater availability is determined by an assessment that considers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the recharge to that groundwater body</li>
  <li>the groundwater contribution to rivers crossing that groundwater body</li>
  <li>the flow needed to support ecology</li>
</ul>

<p>The resource availability for each groundwater body in the East Devon catchments is shown in map 7 
 in section 3.3.</p>

<h4>Groundwater resource availability colours and implications for licensing</h4>

<p>We use colours to represent different groundwater availability.</p>

<p><strong>Water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Green</p>
</div>

<p>New licences can be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Restricted water available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Yellow</p>
</div>

<p>If all licensed groundwater is abstracted there may not be enough water left to maintain a healthy ecology in rivers. This applies to rivers wholly within or crossing the groundwater body.</p>

<p>There is a presumption that no new consumptive licences will be granted that cause flow to fall below the <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr>. It is likely weâll be taking action to reduce fully licensed risks. Water may be available if you can âbuyâ the entitlement to abstract water from an existing licence holder (known as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Manage">water rights trading</a>) although it may be for reduced quantities.</p>

<p><strong>Water not available for licensing</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Red</p>
</div>

<p>More groundwater has been abstracted recently, than the amount available. New groundwater licences could reduce baseflow to rivers where flow is already below the <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is a presumption that no new consumptive licences will be granted that cause flow to fall further below the <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr>. Any water rights trading proposal in these groundwater bodies would need to demonstrate improvements in flow.</p>

<h4>Groundwater availability maps</h4>

<p>Groundwater resource availability in the East Devon catchments is shown in map 7.
Areas showing no colour within the catchmentsâ boundary indicate unproductive strata.</p>

<p>The Otter Valley groundwater model shows that reduced river flow exists between Ottery St Mary and the coast due to groundwater abstraction. There is a presumption that no new consumptive licences will be granted at any time of year in the Otter Valley <abbr title="Groundwater Management Units">GWMU</abbr> shown in red.</p>

<p>There is restricted groundwater availability in the following groundwater bodies, depending on abstraction location:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Central Devon and Exe - Aylesbeare Mudstone</li>
  <li>Permian Aquifers in Central Devon</li>
</ul>

<p>There is groundwater available in all other groundwater bodies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Resource reliability</h3>

<p>If you want to apply for a licence to abstract surface water, itâs worth considering the reliability of that abstraction. By assessing the quantity of surface water available at different flows itâs possible to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when there is a surplus or deficit of water</li>
  <li>the associated reliability of an abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>Map 8 gives an indication of the resource availability for consumptive abstraction of surface water in the East Devon catchments. This is expressed as a percentage of time.</p>

<p>In the Exe catchment area:</p>

<ul>
  <li>APs 1, 2, 11: water is available for consumptive abstraction at least 95% of the time (or 347 days per year)</li>
  <li>APs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9,10: water may only be available for consumptive abstraction 50% of the time (or 183 days per year)</li>
  <li>APs 5: water may only be available for consumptive abstraction 30% of the time (or 110 days per year)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the combined Otter, Sid, Axe and Lim catchment areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>APs 1, 2 and 3: water may only be available for consumptive abstraction 50% of the time (or 183 days per year)</li>
  <li>APs 4, 5, 6 7 and 8: water is available for consumptive abstraction at least 95% of the time (or 347 days per year)</li>
</ul>

<p>Â© Environment Agency copyright</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Other considerations for resource availability and reliability</h3>

<p>In addition to the resource assessment, we must also consider other local factors, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the impact on protected sites</li>
  <li>the impact on other abstractors</li>
  <li>long-term abstraction sustainability</li>
  <li>the risk of saline intrusion</li>
</ul>

<p>This means we may be unable to grant a licence or may need to apply local restrictions which limit the abstraction activity (section 4.2).</p>

<p>Anyone intending to abstract more than 20 cubic metres per day from a groundwater source needs an abstraction licence. They are also likely to need a groundwater investigation consent (<abbr title="Groundwater Investigation Consent">GIC</abbr>) from the Environment Agency under section 32 of the Water Resources Act. Applicants will be required to supply appropriate supporting information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How we manage water availability in the East Devon catchments</h2>

<p>The principal tool for managing water availability is through the abstraction licensing process which we apply across England. By assessing abstraction proposals and implementing restrictions we aim to protect the environment and other abstractors. We add local restrictions to the general principles.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>General principles</h3>

<h4>New applications</h4>

<p>New licences issued in the East Devon catchments will be time limited and issued with a Common End Date (<abbr title="Common End Date">CED</abbr>). This allows all authorisations to be reviewed at the same time. CEDs are set on a 12-year cycle. The next CEDs are as follows:</p>

<p>If an application is made within 6 years of a <abbr title="Common End Date">CED</abbr>, we will generally apply the subsequent <abbr title="Common End Date">CED</abbr> to any licence granted. This means that the initial <abbr title="Common End Date">CED</abbr> will give a licence duration of between 6 and 18 years.</p>

<p>Short-term licences may be necessary where monitoring is required to reduce uncertainty regarding the impact of an abstraction.</p>

<h4>Variations and renewals</h4>

<p>Licence variations and the renewal of time-limited licences will be re-issued provided it can be shown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the abstraction is sustainable</li>
  <li>there is continued justification of need</li>
  <li>the water is used efficiently</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not the case, we may apply more restrictive conditions to the licence.</p>

<p>If your water abstraction licence needs to change, we will consider the impact of those changes on the environment and other abstractors before issuing a variation.</p>

<p>In catchments where water resources are not available or are restricted, we may seek to recover water through the licence renewal or variation process.</p>

<p>Guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-renew-a-water-abstraction-licence">renewing a time-limited licence</a> can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Non-consumptive abstractions</h4>

<p>An abstraction is considered non-consumptive where the water removed is returned to the river at, or near, the point of abstraction without any significant loss. Whilst non-consumptive abstraction should have a neutral impact on water resources, we may apply restrictions to minimise effects on flow-depleted reaches. Additional restrictions may also be applied if a non-consumptive abstraction removes water from one catchment and discharges to another.</p>

<p>The most common type of non-consumptive surface water abstraction in the East Devon catchments are those used for <abbr title="Hydro-electric power">HEP</abbr>. Use our contact details to obtain guidance on <abbr title="Hydro-electric power">HEP</abbr> applications.</p>

<h4>Water Industry National Environment Programme</h4>

<p>Every 5 years, the Water Industry National Environment Programme (<abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr>) sets out the requirements on water companies to address unsustainable abstraction. The current <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> period is April 2020 to March 2025.</p>

<p>In the East Devon catchments, South West Water have undertaken 3 <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> investigations and Wessex Water have undertaken one. These investigations aim to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess the impact abstractions are having on river flows and groundwater levels</li>
  <li>identify how the licences can be changed to restore flows to protect ecology</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions identified, including habitat improvements, will be delivered in the next <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> period.</p>

<p>In the future, the process to identify actions for the <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> will become more collaborative with wider engagement to deliver multiple benefits for catchments. This new process will be used for the next <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> (2025 to 2030).</p>

<h4>Historic licences</h4>

<p>There are some historic licences that do not meet modern standards for the protection of flow and river ecology. These licences are not time limited and do not go through the renewal process outlined in section 4.1.</p>

<p>For these licences of concern, we will work with the licence holder to negotiate changes to improve river flow. Where we are unable to progress voluntary licence changes, we may serve a Notice to enforce those changes. Compensation may be payable to the licence holder.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Local restrictions</h3>

<p>We may add local restrictions to the general principles to protect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specific river flows</li>
  <li>river ecology (including fisheries)</li>
  <li>the rights of other abstractors</li>
</ul>

<p>These are determined on a case-by-case basis. You may be asked to provide further information to support your application. Local restrictions applied in the East Devon catchments are summarised in tables 3, 4 and 5.</p>

<h4>Hands off flows and hands off levels</h4>

<p>To maintain river flow we may restrict surface water abstraction by applying a hands off flow (<abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr>) or hands off level (<abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr>) condition. When the river flow or river level measured at a specified point falls below the set value, abstraction must stop. A <abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr> or <abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr> is linked to an <abbr title="Assessment point">AP</abbr> (using the most appropriate flow gauging station) and is dependent on the resource availability at that <abbr title="Assessment point">AP</abbr>. New surface water licence applications are likely to have <abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr> restrictions applied, as indicated in tables 3 and 4.</p>

<p>Where groundwater abstraction impacts surface water flow, we may also apply a <abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr> or <abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr> condition as summarised in table 5.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may need to protect very low flows, below Q95. We do this by applying a <abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr> condition called the Minimum Residual Flow (<abbr title="Minimum Residual Flow">MRF</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Compensation flows</h4>

<p>To ensure rivers continue to flow downstream of a lake, reservoir or impoundment we may require a minimum continuous outflow (compensation flow) to be maintained. In the East Devon catchments compensation flows are required to support low flows downstream of the following reservoirs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Otterhead Reservoir</li>
  <li>Wimbleball Lake</li>
</ul>

<h4>River flow augmentation</h4>

<p>Where historical groundwater abstraction has been shown to impact river flow, we have in certain circumstances required river flow augmentation. This requires the abstractor to return some of the pumped groundwater into the river to improve flow and protect ecology.</p>

<p>River augmentation has only been applied in the Otter Valley groundwater body. We have used the Otter Valley groundwater model to determine when river augmentation must start and when it can stop.</p>

<p>We are unlikely to grant new abstraction licences which rely on river flow augmentation to protect flow and river ecology.</p>

<h4>Protected areas</h4>

<p>The Environment Agency works with our partners, Natural England, to protect the natural flow regime of designated conservation sites described in section 2.2.</p>

<p>Special Areas of Conservation with a potentially important surface water or groundwater dependence are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>East Devon Pebblebed Heaths <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>River Axe <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Dawlish Warren <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Exmoor Heaths <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Exmoor and Quantock Oakwoods <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The River Barle and Barle Valley are both designated SSSIs, that cross the Exmoor and Quantock Oakwoods <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Designated estuaries in the East Devon catchments include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Exe Estuary <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> and <abbr title="Special Protection Areas">SPA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Otter Estuary <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we think a proposed abstraction could impact on a designated conservation site you may be required to provide additional supporting information. This will allow us to complete the required statutory assessment. We may not be able to issue a licence or may put restrictions on the abstraction to manage the risk to those protected sites.</p>

<p>For some protected areas Natural England publishes river flow targets as part of their revised Common Standards Monitoring Guidance (<abbr title="Common Standards Monitoring Guidance">CSMG</abbr>). These <abbr title="Common Standards Monitoring Guidance">CSMG</abbr> targets are often more restrictive than the standard flow targets that we typically apply. In the East Devon catchments targets have been set for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the River Axe <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the River Barle <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We must consider these targets as part of our licence determination process. Opportunities for new abstractions which will impact on river flows within these designated sites may therefore be limited.</p>

<p>The East Devon Pebblebed Heath <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr> has an ecology that relies upon groundwater emerging at the ground surface. Abstraction licence applications therefore require supporting information which assesses the risk to the ecology within the <abbr title="Special Areas of Conservation">SAC</abbr>.</p>

<p>All new surface water abstractions will also be assessed in relation to their potential impact on biodiversity and fisheries. Site-specific licence conditions, that may include monitoring, may be required to protect these features.</p>

<h4>Coasts and estuaries</h4>

<p>The East Devon coastline faces growing challenges due to climate change. Sea level rise, extreme rainfall events and increasing frequency of storms have the potential to affect water availability and our coastal protected areas.</p>

<p>Groundwater abstraction may pull sea water into freshwater coastal aquifers, thereby reducing groundwater availability. To mitigate this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution#saline-intrusion">saline intrusion</a> effect we may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply a <abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>require groundwater quality monitoring</li>
  <li>issue a licence for a reduced quantity</li>
</ul>

<p>As shown in table 5 a <abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr> has been prescribed for a coastal abstraction borehole in the Otter Valley groundwater body.</p>

<p>In response to the increasing pressure on our coastlines and estuaries, managed realignment schemes are often considered. These schemes attempt to re-establish a more natural and sustainable coastal alignment by the landward retreat of coastal defences and restoration of estuarine habitats. Managed realignment can therefore result in saltwater inundation of previously protected coastal areas.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lowerotterrestorationproject.co.uk/" rel="external">Lower Otter Restoration Project</a> (LORP) is the only managed realignment scheme within the East Devon catchments and is described in section 5.1. For any application within the Lower Otter we must consider the changed saltwater inundation patterns resulting from the scheme.</p>

<h4>Summary of local restrictions</h4>

<p>The local restrictions applied in the East Devon catchments are summarised in tables 3, 4 and 5.</p>

<p>Note: some groundwater bodies shown in table 5 extend beyond the boundary of the East Devon catchments. The extent of these water bodies is defined by their geological boundaries rather than the surface water catchment boundary</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Opportunities</h3>

<p>There may be opportunities for accessing water resources within the East Devon catchments where the resource assessment shows there is limited availability.</p>

<h4>Storage of surface water at times of high flow</h4>

<p>The storage of surplus surface water at times of high flow may increase your water security and flexibility. Typically, surface water is abstracted during winter months and stored in a lined storage reservoir or other impoundment for use during the summer.</p>

<p>We will evaluate any water storage proposal to ensure the needs of river ecology are met and other abstractors protected. Applications for water storage may include restrictions such as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Hands off Flow">HoF</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Hands off Level">HoL</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Other permissions may be required in relation to local planning policy, flood risk and engineering design. Professional advice from a consultant is recommended.</p>

<p>Further information regarding impoundments may be found on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/environmental-management/water">water management web pages</a>.</p>

<h4>Managed aquifer recharge and recovery (<abbr title="Managed Aquifer Recharge and Recovery">MARR</abbr>)</h4>

<p>It may be possible, in certain areas, to abstract surface water when river flow is high and release this water into the ground so that it is stored in the aquifer. This groundwater can then be re-abstracted when river flow is low and surface water abstraction is not possible. This process is called managed aquifer recharge and recovery (<abbr title="Managed Aquifer Recharge and Recovery">MARR</abbr>) and could increase your water security and flexibility.</p>

<p>This is a new approach in the UK and there are currently no <abbr title="Managed Aquifer Recharge and Recovery">MARR</abbr> schemes or trials authorised in the East Devon catchments.</p>

<h4>Water rights trading</h4>

<p>A water rights trade is where a person sells all or part of their abstraction licence on a permanent or temporary basis. In most cases a trade will involve a change in abstraction location and/or use.</p>

<p>We will need to approve this through the issue or variation of abstraction licences. The Environment Agency does not act as a âbrokerâ for this trading â it is up to interested parties to make contact and agree how they would like to trade. This is a relatively new approach to improve access to water across catchments where there are restrictions on issuing new licences.</p>

<p>The potential for trading in water bodies is dependent on water resource availability colour (sections 3.2 and 3.3). You may be restricted to trading recent actual quantities and local restrictions (section 4.2) may be applied. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Managing the East Devon catchments together</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Approaches to sustainable water management</h3>

<p>Collaborative working currently occurs across the East Devon catchments. However, given the abstraction pressure and environmental sensitivity, the River Otter was designated a priority catchment in 2019. It is hoped that this will prompt new ways of working in the Otter priority catchment which will inform wider collaborative working.</p>

<h4>Otter priority catchment characteristics</h4>

<p>The Otter priority catchment shown in map 9 covers an area of approximately 234 km<sup>2</sup>. It includes the surface water catchment area of the River Otter and its tributaries (River Tale, River Wolf and River Love).</p>

<p>The River Otter rises at springs along the edge of the Blackdown Hills in the north and the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths <a class="govuk-link" href="#Abbreviations"><abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr></a> in the west. The River Otter flows onto the sandstone aquifer near Ottery St Mary where groundwater baseflow becomes an important contribution to river flow. Groundwater abstraction reduces river flow between Ottery St Mary and the coast. The River Otter and several small tributaries  discharge to the Otter Estuary at Budleigh Salterton.</p>

<h4>Stakeholder and Partnership Groups</h4>

<p>The following stakeholder and partnerships groups are active in the East Devon catchments, including the Otter priority catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wcwrg.org/" rel="external">West Country Water Resources</a> (WCWR).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/get-involved/east-devon/" rel="external">East Devon Catchment Partnership</a> (EDCP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>South West Water Upstream Thinking</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wcwrg.org/" rel="external">WCWR</a> is led by the water companies Bristol Water, South West Water and Wessex Water. It works at a strategic level across the whole of the West Country to develop a co-ordinated approach to water resource planning for the next 25 years. The Environment Agency is also a core member. We ensure that the Otter priority catchment work is aligned with WCWR Group strategic direction.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://catchmentbasedapproach.org/get-involved/east-devon/" rel="external">EDCP</a> is hosted by Devon Wildlife Trust and West Country Rivers Trust. It aims to deliver positive outcomes for the water environment through local collaboration. Recent projects have focussed on water quality and flood risk issues. There may be future opportunities to collaborate on water resource issues in the Otter priority catchment.</p>

<p>South West Water is leading a catchment management partnership called Upstream Thinking. It aims to enhance water quality and ecology by working with landowners and farmers across the West Country. Projects in the River Otter catchment have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>improving soils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reducing nitrogen loss to groundwater</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving habitats for wildlife</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Deterioration in groundwater quality could lead to a reduction in amount available for drinking water purposes and its use by river ecology.</p>

<p>In addition, the first meeting of the Otter Valley abstractor group took place in September 2021 as part of the priority catchment initiative. Attendees included water companies, landowners, quarry operators and other commercial and private abstractors. Abstraction is reducing flow in the River Otter to levels that are too low to support the expected ecology. We hope that the abstractor group will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>stimulate conversations between abstractors on their future water needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>help abstractors identify how these future water needs can be met sustainably</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>share understanding of water company actions that develop through the <abbr title="Water Industry National Environment Plan">WINEP</abbr> investigations and options appraisal (see section 4.1)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on future events please contact the Devon and Cornwall Integrated Environmental Planning team using the details in section 9.</p>

<h4>Otter Valley groundwater model</h4>

<p>A computer model has been co-developed by the Environment Agency and South West Water. It represents how rainfall moves through soils, into aquifers and interacts with rivers in the Otter priority catchment. The model allows us to assess the current impact of abstractions on river flow and to test any future changes that may be proposed.</p>

<p>The model underpins all resource assessment work within the Otter priority catchment. It has allowed us to reduce abstraction licence volumes, design river augmentation schemes and assess the effects of climate change.</p>

<h4>Groundwater Recharge and Working With Natural Processes</h4>

<p>This new Environment Agency study provides evidence for the benefits of working with natural processes (WWNP). It focusses on improving resilience to droughts and floods by restoring natural catchment functions. Natural processes help to store water in the ground and slow down the rate at which it enters rivers.</p>

<p>In the River Otter catchment, WWNP has mapped potential interventions that could help improve water infiltration and groundwater availability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>installing attenuation features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improving soil and land management techniques</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>re-naturalising the channel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>storing more water within the valley floors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The project produced a series of maps. These show where these actions are most likely to be effective. This is a valuable resource for water users considering holistic catchment-based solutions. The full report is available on the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/water-resources/water-resources-priority-catchments/" rel="external">Environment Agency priority catchment website</a>. The potential benefit of increased infiltration through WWNP processes are being evaluated using the Otter Valley groundwater model in 2022.</p>

<h4>Investigating land use and water resource project</h4>

<p>This Environment Agency project is assessing the effectiveness of trees to reduce surface water run-off and create infiltration pathways.</p>

<p>Monitoring equipment has been installed in the River Wolf and River Love catchments to analyse responses to rainfall events in 3 vegetation types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fully wooded</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rivers with wooded buffer strips</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>open managed grassland</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The project has benefited from engagement with landowners on monitoring equipment and land use. The results should help inform future tree planting to maximise water resource benefits.</p>

<p>Project members include South West Water, Devon County Council and Natural England.</p>

<h4>River Otter beaver trial</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.devonwildlifetrust.org/what-we-do/our-projects/river-otter-beaver-trial" rel="external">River Otter Beaver Trial</a> was a 5-year project (2015 to 2020) to evaluate the effects of the reintroduction of Eurasian beavers into the wild. It has demonstrated that beaver engineering in the River Otter has had multiple benefits for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>flooding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ecology</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>slowing river flow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting low flow regimes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The beaver trial has shown that during storms peak flows are 30% lower leaving the site than entering. The slow release of this stored water maintains a higher downstream flow, over a longer period (even at times of low flow). Thus potentially allowing abstraction to continue.</p>

<h4>Lower Otter Restoration Project</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.lowerotterrestorationproject.co.uk/" rel="external">Lower Otter Restoration Project</a> (LORP) is an important project in the East Devon catchments. It seeks to pre-emptively adapt and enhance the downstream part of the River Otter in the face of a rapidly changing climate. This managed realignment scheme is being implemented because the existing 200-year-old sea defences are now starting to fail and are becoming increasingly hard to maintain.</p>

<p>Working with the landowner (Clinton Devon Estates) and the local community, we are reconnecting the River Otter to its historic floodplain. This will return the lower Otter Valley to a more natural condition by creating more than 50 hectares of intertidal mudflats and saltmarsh. Construction works started in Spring 2021 and will be completed by Spring 2023.</p>

<p>Once the project is complete the site will be inundated twice a day by saline water entering the lower Otter Valley floodplain. Modelling has shown this to have a neutral effect on the groundwater quality of existing abstractions. However, the changed saltwater inundation patterns will need to be considered when assessing future abstraction proposals in this area. As part of the scheme groundwater monitoring boreholes are being installed to monitor the potential impact of saline intrusion.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Glossary</h2>

<p>Abstraction - removal of water from a source of supply (surface or groundwater).</p>

<p>Abstraction licence - the authorisation granted by the Environment Agency to allow the removal of water.</p>

<p>Aquifer - a water-bearing geological unit that can yield economically viable amounts of groundwater.</p>

<p>Assessment point -  a significant point on a river, often where 2 major rivers join or at a gauging station.</p>

<p>Baseflow - baseflow is the proportion of river flow derived from subsurface pathways, most notably groundwater. The baseflow component of river flow is delayed relative to rainfall runoff pathway and can therefore be important in sustaining rivers at times of low flow.</p>

<p>Catchment - the area from which precipitation and groundwater will collect and contribute to the flow of a specific river.</p>

<p>Catchment based approach - partnership working at the river catchment scale to deliver a range of environmental, social and economic benefits while protecting our precious water environments for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>Consumptive abstraction - abstraction where a significant proportion of the water is not returned either directly or indirectly to the source of supply after use. For example for the use of spray irrigation.</p>

<p>Common Standard Monitoring Guidance - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/common-standards-monitoring/" rel="external">Common Standards Monitoring</a> was developed to provide an agreed approach for the assessment of conditions on protected sites designated through UK legislation and international agreements. The targets set as part of Common Standards Monitoring are the main conservation objectives for European and <abbr title="Sites of Special Scientific Interest">SSSI</abbr> protected sites required to maintain them at, or to reach, favourable condition. These quantitative targets are considered by Natural England as a pre-requisite for achieving the conservation objectives for those important sites. The process for setting targets is described through the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) approved <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/1b15dd18-48e3-4479-a168-79789216bc3d" rel="external">Common Standards Monitoring Guidance</a> or <abbr title="Common Standards Monitoring Guidance">CSMG</abbr>. The targets are set by Natural England and include river flow. The Environment Agency must have regard to Natural Englandâs advice when determining licence applications that may impact on a designated site.</p>

<p>Discharge - the release of substances (for example, water, treated sewage effluent) into surface waters.</p>

<p>Environmental flow indicator - the environmental flow indicator, or <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr>, is a percentage deviation from the natural river flow that is required to support Good Ecological Status as defined by the Water Framework Directive. It is the proportion of the natural flow for a river that is allocated for the environment and is dependent on the sensitivity of the river to abstraction (and other impacts on flow). The <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr> is set through expert opinion and is dependent on river type, river flow and the ecological sensitivity of the river to changes in flow. The <abbr title="Ecological Flow Indicator">EFI</abbr> was set in line with new UK standards set by UK Technical Advisory Group (UK TAG).</p>

<p>Fully Licensed - the volume of surface water or groundwater abstracted if all authorised abstraction licences were being used to their full quantity.</p>

<p>Groundwater - water that is contained in underground rocks and sediments below the ground surface.</p>

<p>Groundwater Body - groundwater bodies are the discrete groundwater management unit defined by the Environment Agency as required under Article 5 of the Water Framework Directive.</p>

<p>Hands off flow - a condition attached to an abstraction licence which states that if flow (in the river) falls below the level specified on the licence, the abstractor will be required to reduce or stop the abstraction.</p>

<p>Impoundment - a structure that obstructs or impedes the flow of inland water, such as a dam, weir or other constructed works.</p>

<p>Non-consumptive abstraction - a groundwater or surface water abstraction where the water removed is returned to the source of supply at or near the point of abstraction without any significant loss of water.</p>

<p>Otter Sandstone - the Otter Sandstone is the historical name given to the most productive aquifer unit in East Devon catchments. This geological unit has been renamed the Helsby Sandstone Formation. The Helsby Sandstone Formation is commonly underlain by the Chester Formation which was historically known as the Budleigh Salterton Pebble Beds. The historical names for both these geological formations are still commonly used. Taken together, the Helsby Sandstone Formation and Chester Formation constitute the nationally important aquifer of the Sherwood Sandstone Group.</p>

<p>Recent actual - the amount of water actually abstracted by surface water or groundwater licenses on average over the previous 6-year period.</p>

<p>Surface water - this is a general term used to describe all water features such as rivers, streams, springs, ponds and lakes.</p>

<p>Water body - units of either surface water or groundwater which we use to assess water availability.</p>

<p>Water Framework Directive - the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) is the key piece of legislation that introduced a comprehensive river basin management planning system to the UK to help protect and improve the ecological health of our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coasts and groundwater.</p>
