<p>Did you know?</p>

<p>Fires on boats have killed 30 boaters in the last 20 years.</p>

<p>Most fires are preventable. This leaflet provides tips and advice on how to protect your boat and crew from fire, and what to do should a fire break out.</p>
</div>

<h2>Alarms save lives</h2>

<p>Boat fires can spread and become filled with smoke quickly.</p>

<h3>Smoke alarms</h3>

<p>Optical sensor alarms with hush buttons and ‘sealed for life’ batteries are best for boats. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.boatsafetyscheme.org/fire" rel="external">Visit the boat safety scheme website</a> for advice and guidance.</p>

<p>Fit alarms in places you will hear them clearly if they go off.</p>

<p>Consider installing linked alarms that will go off at the same time.</p>

<p>Test the alarms when you board and at least monthly when aboard. Never disconnect it or remove working batteries.</p>

<h3>Gas leak indicators</h3>

<p>Fit a bubble type gas leak indicator in the LPG cylinder locker.</p>

<p>Push the gas leak indicator test button routinely to check for leaks in the gas system.</p>

<h3>Carbon monoxide (CO) alarms</h3>

<p>Fit a CO alarm to alert you of any poisonous carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>Check your CO alarm is suitable for marine use and meets the EN50291-2 standard.</p>

<p>Look out for an approval symbol when buying smoke and CO alarms.</p>

<h2>Safe cooking and heating</h2>

<p>Turn cooking appliances off properly after use.</p>

<p>Never leave cooking unattended. Turn things off until you come back.</p>

<p>Take extra care when cooking with oil – it sets alight easily.</p>

<p>Avoid cooking when tired. Remember, medication and alcohol can cause drowsiness.</p>

<p>Keep the cooking area clean for safety – a build-up of grease could catch light.</p>

<p>Spark devices are safer than matches or lighters to light gas cookers, because they don’t have a naked flame.</p>

<p>Only use portable appliances onshore and don’t change gas canisters inside the cabin or covered areas.</p>

<p>Barbecues shouldn’t be used on boats – hot charcoal gives off dangerous amounts of CO and blown embers could set your boat alight.</p>

<p>Keep cabin ventilation clear to prevent a build-up of toxic CO.</p>

<p>Try to keep fabrics away from cooking hobs to prevent them from catching fire.</p>

<p>Damaged stoves and flues could burn too hot; check adjacent areas for heat damage. Have your chimney swept regularly.</p>

<p>Only use the fuel recommended by the heater manufacturer. Other types may burn too hot.</p>

<p>Dispose of embers carefully. If they’re still warm they could cause a fire or build-up of CO.</p>

<p>Ensure all hobs burners have a flame supervision device to shut-off the gas if the flame is blown out.</p>

<p>Always ensure heater components are specifically marine grade and are supplied as intended to be fitted to the make and model of the heater in use.</p>

<h2>Protecting the inside of your boat</h2>

<p>Don’t smoke or use candles if you’re drowsy because of medication or alcohol.</p>

<h3>Cigarettes</h3>

<p>Dispose of cigarettes carefully. Put them out, right out.</p>

<p>Don’t smoke inside the boat. Smoke outdoors and put cigarettes right out – this is safer than smoking in the boat.</p>

<p>Keep cigarettes or pipes away from anything that could catch fire, such as curtains.</p>

<p>Never smoke when refuelling or changing a gas cylinder.</p>

<p>Use a proper ashtray that will stay stable on the boat.</p>

<p>Take extra care if you smoke when you’re tired and never smoke in bed.</p>

<p>Empty ashtrays regularly. A build-up of ash could catch fire.</p>

<h3>Candles</h3>

<p>Candles have started fatal boat fires. Consider using LED alternatives for light or ambience.</p>

<p>Pot-purri and oil-reed diffusers are far safer alternatives to scented candles.</p>

<p>If you must use lit candles, ensure they’re in secure fire-proof holders and never leave them unattended.</p>

<h3>Furnishings</h3>

<p>Try to choose furniture that carries the fire-resistant label.</p>

<p>Keep fabrics and paper away from anything hot like hobs, flues and light bulbs.</p>

<p>Watch out for domed-decklights focussing light rays and causing heat damage or fires in strong sunlight.</p>

<h2>Fuel and power safety</h2>

<p>Make sure you check and maintain your boat’s fuel, gas and electrical systems on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>Engine maintenance</h3>

<p>Don’t let oil or debris build- up in the bilges.</p>

<p>Inspect surfaces and items adjacent to exhausts for signs of heat damage or charring.</p>

<p>Check exhaust systems of inboard engines for leaks.</p>

<p>Check for loose fuel joints, damaged fuel tanks or deteriorating hoses.</p>

<h3>Fuel safety</h3>

<p>Take care when refuelling. Put out naked flames first. Turn off the engine and cooking before handling any fuel.</p>

<p>Only carry spare petrol if necessary and store it in a self-draining locker or on open deck.</p>

<p>Generators should only be used and stored outside the cabin space.</p>

<p>When refuelling, prevent petrol vapour from entering the boat by closing the doors, windows or hatches and closing the awning.</p>

<p>Refuel outboard engines and generators well away from the boat.</p>

<p>Leaks, spills and vapour can ignite easily. Clean them up straight away and make sure filler caps are secure after refuelling.</p>

<p>If you can smell gas, turn the supply off and get it checked out straight away!</p>

<h3>Gas safety</h3>

<p>Have appliances properly installed and serviced routinely by competent fitters.</p>

<p>Never restrict airflow by blocking vents or air gaps.</p>

<p>Make sure gas cylinders are secure after they’ve been changed. Test for leaks with leak detection fluid.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, turn gas valves off before you go to bed or leave the boat.</p>

<p>Replace gas hoses showing signs of cracking, bitterness or discolouration.</p>

<p>Store gas cylinders outside, in a self-draining and</p>

<p>fire resistant locker. Keep them upright and secured from moving.</p>

<h3>Electrics</h3>

<p>Check for the British or European safety mark when buying electrical goods.</p>

<p>Use a trained marine electrician to install and service electrics.</p>

<p>Don’t overload adaptors. Keep to one plug per socket. Use the right fuse or circuit breaker to avoid overheating.</p>

<p>Unplug appliances when they’re not in use or when you leave the boat.</p>

<p>Take extra care when reinstalling the boat’s batteries. Check straps or restraints are secure afterwards.</p>

<p>Damaged wires can overheat rapidly, so look out for scorch marks or burning smells and listen out for buzzing, fizzing or crackling.</p>

<p>If there is any sign of a problem, turn the power off and don’t switch it on until it’s been checked out!</p>

<h2>Plan a safe escape</h2>

<p>Make an emergency plan with everyone on board before you set out.</p>

<p>Make sure people know how to close emergency valves and switches in case of fire.</p>

<p>You are more at risk from a fire when asleep, so check your boat before you go to bed. Make sure cooking and heating appliances are off and candles and cigarettes are fully extinguished.</p>

<p>Keep a torch easily available to help you escape at night. Make sure you have spares and test them regularly.</p>

<p>Don’t go to sea without a VHF radio. Have a charged- up, handheld, waterproof one ready for use at any time.</p>

<p>Don’t rely on a mobile phone. There could be no signal and it may not be waterproof.</p>

<p>Have enough life jackets for everyone on board, and keep them in good condition.</p>

<p>Keep exits clear and keys to hand. Don’t lock or bolt doors and hatches from the outside.</p>

<p>Track your location so you can tell the emergency services where you are if needed.</p>

<p>Consider having a ‘grab- bag’ for removing vital possessions in an emergency.</p>

<h2>What to do if there’s a fire</h2>

<p>If in doubt, don’t fight a fire yourself. Get out, stay out, call 999/ ch16 for help and wait for the fire and rescue services.</p>

<p>Do not enter a smoke filled space.</p>

<p>If you are already in a smoke filled space keep low down where the air is clearer.</p>

<p>If you need to break glass to escape use a blanket to prevent injury.</p>

<p>Starve the fire of air. Don’t open engine hatches or doors unless you have to.</p>

<h3>Inland fires</h3>

<p>If you are inland or moored near to land move everybody off the boat and call 999 immediately.</p>

<h3>Fires at sea</h3>

<p>If you are off-shore move as far away from the fire as you can on deck. Get everybody into life jackets.</p>

<p>Take a handheld VHF radio onto deck with you to call for help.</p>

<p>Notify the Coastguard by radio, make a Mayday call and/or display a distress signal.</p>

<h2>Fire blankets and extinguishers</h2>

<p>Familiarise yourself with how to use any extinguishers on board.</p>

<p>Only consider tackling a fire with an extinguisher if you are confident how to use it. Don’t place yourself in danger. If in doubt, evacuate the boat.</p>

<p>Keep fire blankets and extinguishers within easy reach, close to exits and risk points, such as the galley and engine area.</p>

<p>Check extinguishers on a regular basis for serious dents, leaks and loss of pressure.</p>

<p>Check the pin and mechanism for any signs of problems or weaknesses.</p>

<p>Check the dates on extinguishers and blankets and service or replace them as recommended by the instructions.</p>

<p>Be prepared for a dry powder extinguisher to create a dense powder-cloud, reducing visibility and impairing breathing. Don’t jeopardise your escape.</p>

<p>Only choose extinguishers that carry recognised approval marks.</p>

<h2>Check list</h2>

<p>Everybody aboard needs to know the emergency and escape plan.</p>

<p>Get to know how to use the fire blanket and fire extinguishers.</p>

<p>Test the smoke alarms this month.</p>

<p>Keep escape routes clear – if a fire wakes you up, you’ve got to get out fast.</p>

<p>If the boat’s occupied, ensure doors and emergency exits will open from the inside.</p>

<p>Don’t leave the galley when cooking and don’t cook while tired. Don’t use portable LPG camping equipment aboard.</p>

<p>Dispose of cigarettes carefully – put them out, right out.</p>

<p>Keep fabrics like curtains, towels and clothing safely away from hobs and heaters.</p>

<p>Don’t ignore anything that looks, smells or sounds like it is scorching, melting or sparking.</p>

<p>Handle petrol away from the boat – keep petrol vapour out of the cabin.</p>
