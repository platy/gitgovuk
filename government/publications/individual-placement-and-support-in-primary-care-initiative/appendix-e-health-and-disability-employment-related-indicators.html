<p>This table includes data for upper tier local authorities in England on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the proportion of the working age population for individuals receiving Employment Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) due to a health condition or disability</li>
  <li>the proportion of the working age population for households receiving Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) who been assessed to have limited capability for work and work related activity (<abbr title="limited capability for work and work related activity">LCWRA</abbr>) and are therefore entitled to additional support</li>
  <li>the disability employment rate (a person is defined as disabled if they have a health condition lasting more than 12 months that impacts negatively on their daily life); and</li>
  <li>the gap between the employment rate of disabled and non-disabled people</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The column for ESA relates to individual claimants whereas the column for UC relates to household claims. A small number - around 6% of ESA claimants nationally - also claim both benefits. 
<br><br>
It is therefore strongly advised not to sum the figures in these two columns.</p>
</div>

<p>The number in brackets next to each value show how it compares to all other Local Authorities - the lower the rank the better with 151 being the highest.</p>
