<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> 
1. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) are providing Grant Funding for around 6 Upper Tier <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> (Local Authorities) in England, to take part in Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care (<abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>) (the “Initiative”).</p>

<p>2. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative is aimed at adults who have a physical or mental health disability, as defined by the Equality Act 2010, to help them to move into competitive employment<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> providing the support they need to maintain that employment.</p>

<p>3. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> builds on the core principles and the fidelity scale adopted by the established Individual Placement Support (<abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr>) model, as well as learning from the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Health Led Trials (<abbr title="Health Led Trial">HLT</abbr>). <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will be delivered in primary and community NHS (National Health Service) services applying a modified version of the eight key principles of <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> (see paragraph 24) and will be integrated with an individual’s health treatment (as required).</p>

<p>4. Through funding and providing a quality framework for <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will enable the delivery of high-quality support that shows fidelity to the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> model. The longer-term ambition of this Initiative is to provide further evidence of the value of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> which will help to build sustained investment and secure effective employment for Participants.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will be delivered in primary and community NHS services applying a modified version of the 8 principles of <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr>. <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> is a model of Supported Employment that is well-evidenced internationally and proven to be effective for people with severe mental illness. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> should be integrated with a Participants normal health treatment (as required).</p>

<p>6.  Local Authorities are invited to submit the Grant Application set out at Annex B – Appendix B, which will be evaluated against the Assessment Criteria set out at Annex B – Appendix A.</p>

<p>7. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant will be paid under section 2 of the Employment and Training Act (1973).</p>

<p>8. This <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> Grant Guidance (“Grant Guidance”) document sets out the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background</li>
  <li>Grant details</li>
  <li>Grant payment</li>
  <li>Grant Application process and requirements</li>
  <li>Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) reporting requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>9. This Grant Guidance document should be read in conjunction with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grant Competition Launch Letter (June 2022),</li>
  <li>Grant Application Instructions and Assessment Criteria</li>
  <li>Grant Application</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Template</li>
</ul>

<p>10. This Grant Guidance document is subject to change. Updated documents will be circulated following any required changes.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>11. The employment rate for disabled people (53.8%) is significantly lower than the employment rate for non-disabled people. The NHS Long Term Plan recognises that mental health and musculoskeletal conditions remain the main reason for sickness absence increasing. Supporting people to access employment through <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will build on individuals’ strengths and skills, enabling them to realise their potential for recovery. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will support inclusive growth and help to achieve a reduction in health inequalities.</p>

<p>12. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> initiative provides an excellent opportunity for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to improve employment and health outcomes in their local area. Too often people face a negative experience of declining health which excludes them from work, often leading to long term worklessness, which in turn causes further deterioration in health.</p>

<p>13. The number of working age people with health conditions who are outside the labour market has increased by over 10% over the last two years to 2.2million. Attached at Appendix E are some indicators which demonstrate the impact in local areas – showing the prevalence of out-of-work health benefit receipt in local populations, the employment rate gap between disabled and non-disabled people and the rate at which people leave work due to health conditions.</p>

<p>14. Supporting people to access employment builds on their strengths and skills and enables them to realise their potential for recovery. Supporting disabled people into work will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help them recover more rapidly and effectively from their health issue or build strategies to manage their health condition and barriers to work</li>
  <li>build social connections and support networks.</li>
  <li>gain financial independence, and</li>
  <li>improve their general health and wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<p>15. Where a disability is proving an obstacle to maintaining or obtaining employment, providing employment support whilst working closely with primary care services helps to ensure that Participants receive the holistic service, they need to address potential barriers to employment.</p>

<p>16. Delivered through existing primary and community NHS Services, <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will apply a modified version of the principles of <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr>. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will be integrated with a Participants normal health treatment encouraging recognition of employment as a driver of an individual’s health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>17.  Local Integrated Care Boards (<abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr>) will be key to successfully delivering <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>. Each Integrated Care System (ICS) will have an <abbr title="Integrated Care Board">ICB</abbr> (Integrated Care Board), a statutory organisation bringing the NHS together locally to improve population health and establish shared strategic priorities within the NHS. <abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr> will replace existing Clinical Commissioning Groups (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Groups">CCGs</abbr>).</p>

<p>18. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will support local ambitions to deliver inclusive growth and help to reduce health inequalities.</p>

<h3>Background to Individual Placement and Support</h3>

<p>19. <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> is a replicable, evidence-based, Supported Employment programme that has been shown to deliver superior employment and health outcomes for people with severe and enduring mental health problems and there is growing evidence that <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> also works for other groups.</p>

<p>20. <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> defines competitive employment as a job that any person can apply for regardless of their disability status. These jobs may be full or part time and can include self-employment. Workers in these positions should earn at least the minimum wage and receive similar wages and benefits as their co‐workers. Volunteering, training, and work placements are not considered an employment outcome but may, in specific cases, be activities that help an individual secure paid competitive employment.</p>

<p>21. There is a large international body of robust evidence including randomised controlled trials on <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr>. Previous evidence has demonstrated that <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> can achieve up to twice as many job outcomes for people with severe mental illness than traditional programmes i.e. in 2013, 55% of <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Participants were found to be in competitive employment for at least one day compared to 28% of people in the control group<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Health Led Trials</h2>

<p>22. <abbr title="Health Led Trials">HLTs</abbr> (Health Led Trials) were conducted in South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (<abbr title="South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority">SYMCA</abbr>) and West Midlands Combined Authority (<abbr title="West Midlands Combined Authority">WMCA</abbr>) from 2018 to 2020. The <abbr title="Health Led Trials">HLTs</abbr> tested whether a Supported Employment intervention, based on <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> principles, had the impact of improving employment, health, and wellbeing beyond that which can be achieved with existing support for individuals with common mental health and/or physical health conditions.</p>

<p>23. Since concluding the trials in October 2020, post-trial provision has continued in the trial areas to maintain support and protect the expertise, relationships, and momentum of the service.</p>

<h3>Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care</h3>

<p>24. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> approach is based on a modified version of 8 key <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> principles as follows:</p>

<p>i.	It aims to get people into competitive employment in the open labour market</p>

<p>ii.	It is open to eligible people who want to work</p>

<p>iii.	It aims to find jobs consistent with people’s preferences</p>

<p>iv.	It works quickly – a Place, Train and Maintain model of rapid activation and job search alongside delivery of work, health, and wider support needs</p>

<p>v.	It brings <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Employment Specialists into clinical teams</p>

<p>vi.	<abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Employment Specialists develop relationships with employers based upon a person’s work preferences</p>

<p>vii.	It provides time limited, individualised support for the person and their employer</p>

<p>viii.	Access to specialist benefits advice is included</p>

<p>25. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> model of Supported Employment is about achieving a mainstream Baseline Threshold Job Outcome or Higher Threshold Job Outcome at the Going Rate of Pay with necessary support provided for the individual and employer to sustain the job.</p>

<p>26. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will develop strong links and referral arrangements with community organisations and local partners such as GPs, and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, Jobcentre Plus, social care, community health services, health navigator services, educational institutions, volunteering organisations, and housing services among others.</p>

<p>27. Delivery of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> must adhere to the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> key requirements, set out at paragraph 30.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>28. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is aiming to deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> for up to 21,000 Participants in around 6 areas. Using evidence from other <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> programmes and the <abbr title="Health Led Trials">HLTs</abbr>, the aim is to deliver the expected benefits of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>.</p>

<p>29. Stretching but realistic job outcome targets are required, with a focus on maximising sustained paid employment. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to use the baseline levels below but also consider if levels above the baseline are appropriate, based on local participant data/ demographics/ employment and vacancy levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The main target is for 30% of total Initiative Starts to achieve a Baseline Threshold Job Outcome.</li>
  <li>40% of Initiative Starts should achieve a Job Start</li>
  <li>75% of people who achieve a Job Start should achieve a Baseline Threshold Job Outcome (i.e., 30% of total Initiative Starts)</li>
  <li>65% of people who achieve a Baseline Threshold Job Outcome should achieve a Higher Threshold Job Outcome (i.e., 20% of total Initiative Starts)</li>
</ul>

<p>30. The key requirements of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support local economic growth through the employment of people with a mental or physical health condition or disability</li>
  <li>Enable sustained employment of Participants in employment but whose disability is impacting their ability to work</li>
  <li>Develop a framework for effective, locally driven integrated employment support that can be sustained</li>
  <li>Continue to build the evidence base for innovative employment interventions to facilitate a potential national proven approach.</li>
  <li>Improve Participants general health and wellbeing, including support to help people recover more rapidly and effectively from their disability, which could include building strategies to manage their disability and barriers to work and gain financial independence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grant Details</h2>

<p>31. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant Applicants are invited to apply for Grant Funding to deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> to between 1000 – 3500 Participants per year per Grant Recipient, across the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Funding Period (April 2023 to March 2025).</p>

<p>32. As a guide, around 75% of Participants should be Out-of-Work Participants and in need of support to attain employment and 25% In-Work Participants needing support to avoid falling out-of-work.</p>

<p>33. Recruitment of Participants can occur for up to the first 20 months of the programme. Grant Applicants will be required to submit a profile of projected volumes for both Participant groups for the Funding Period (see Appendix C – Profile Template). Grant Applicants should consider the periods of recruitment and support within their Profile Template.</p>

<p>34. When determining the number of Participants that Grant Applicants are committing to support with the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant, they should ensure they provide a clear rationale within their Grant Application to validate this. The rationale should reflect on their ability to set up and operate a successful programme for the Funding Period including securing an Activity Delivery Partner (if the delivery model requires), staff recruitment, required integration within the local health system, managing referrals, location (rural or urban), Participant demographics and any other relevant internal or external factors, which might impact the number of Participants they can successfully recruit to the programme and effectively support.</p>

<p>35. Each Grant Recipient must enter into a Grant Funding Agreement with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The Grant Funding Agreement must be signed for, and on behalf of, the Grant Recipient (as set out in the Grant Funding Letter) and returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within the specified timeframe.</p>

<h2>Funded Activities</h2>

<p>36. Delivery of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will follow the 8 key principles outlined at paragraph 24 of this Grant Guidance document, as well as limiting the length of time that an Employment Specialist can support a Participant, to an expected maximum of 12 months for Out-of-Work Participants, or 4 months for In-Work Participants. Limiting the support period in this way for most Participants has been shown to allow more people to use the service without impacting outcomes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. This time limit may be exceeded on a case-by-case basis where individuals are actively seeking employment or in need of continued in-work support.</p>

<p>37. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will support people to achieve their employment aspirations with a focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paid, competitive employment, including self-employment where relevant</li>
  <li>Voluntary participation underpinned by informed consent and a focus on understanding and supporting Participant needs</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> is closely aligned with primary and community care and physical health care teams where appropriate, with Participants receiving employment advice alongside other healthcare support.</li>
  <li>Supported Employment via the Place, Train and Maintain model of rapid activation and job search, followed by in-work support tailored to the individual needs of a person.</li>
  <li>Rapid support for In-Work Participants needing support with their health issues and involvement of employers as appropriate.</li>
  <li>‘Zero Exclusion’ based on the nature of health condition and barriers to work (within the Eligibility Criteria)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> inputting into the treatment/discharge or clinical assessment and review process as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Working alongside health professionals to see the value of and embed the value of work to help improve health</li>
</ul>

<p>38.  Grant Recipients will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver the implementation activities outlined in their Grant Application and agreed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, such as development of supporting processes and procedures, recruitment, training, and marketing</li>
  <li>Deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> for people with a physical or mental health disability who meet all the Eligibility Criteria</li>
  <li>Ensure that a Participant’s eligibility is checked as outlined in this Grant Guidance document</li>
  <li>Market the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative to reach the target customer group</li>
  <li>Start consenting Participants onto <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> who satisfy the Eligibility Criteria</li>
  <li>Ensure that a Job Start is achieved for at least 40% of Participants</li>
  <li>Ensure that a Baseline Threshold Job Outcome is achieved for at least 30% of Participants</li>
  <li>Ensure all Participants work towards securing a minimum of 7 hours work per week, with as many as possible supported to work more than 16 hours per week for a minimum of 13 weeks duration</li>
  <li>Ensure all Participants work towards a Higher Threshold Job Outcome to work for a minimum of 7 hours per week for 26 weeks in a 32-week period</li>
  <li>Ensure Participants are being paid at least the Going Rate of Pay</li>
  <li>Provide all information/documentation requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for the purposes of activities undertaken by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to evaluate the effectiveness and success of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant</li>
</ul>

<p>39. In managing the volumes of referrals and Initiative Starts, and identifying appropriate participants for <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>, Grant Applicants should carefully consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The drop-out rate between referral and Initiative Starts as well as the numbers currently participating in the Initiative</li>
  <li>Maximising referral routes, using all appropriate organisations for signposting and managing self-referrals</li>
  <li>Clarifying the support offer as part of any communications, with an emphasis on paid employment outcomes and wider health benefits.</li>
  <li>That any marketing could include targeted information to specific referral routes or potential participants being encouraged/referred by health professionals e.g., targeted text messages, marketing materials supplied in a health appointment</li>
  <li>The language and branding used in communications, e.g., references to patient not claimant has been effective in the <abbr title="Health Led Trial">HLT</abbr> sites. Using health branding including the NHS logo can also be effective</li>
  <li>That delivery will need to respond to the evolving employment, welfare, and health landscape during the Funding Period</li>
</ul>

<p>40. In delivering this Initiative the Grant Recipients should carefully consider the current and planned delivery environment within their location including but not limited to considering post Covid-19 NHS impacts and local labour market factors and plan delivery accordingly.</p>

<p>41. Activity Delivery Partners will report to the Grant Recipient on delivery of the Initiative, who in turn will be required to provide information and assurances about the delivery of the Initiative. This includes monthly monitoring and reporting of agreed outcome measures and performance. Maintaining the quality of delivery at all times is essential, including ensuring appropriate staff are in place throughout the delivery of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>.</p>

<p>42. Grant Recipients will need to commit to the above requirements (paragraph 41 i.e. the paragraph directly above)  and therefore Grant Applications are expected to demonstrate how the staffing response adheres to the fidelity of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>. It is expected that Activity Delivery Partners will align and partner with other organisations as necessary.</p>

<p>43. <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> are expected to work at any one time with a caseload of between 20-25 active cases. Evidence has shown that this is an effective caseload to provide the support required. An active Participant is defined as someone who has been in contact with the service in the last 4 weeks and continues to be engaged in their Vocational Action Plan. Each Grant Applicant should though determine their caseload size based on their <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> delivery model and local information. The size and management of caseloads will be a key feature of Fidelity Reviews.</p>

<p>44. Grant Recipients will recognise and adopt best practice and tailor the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> to the Participant’s needs. Grant Recipients will be expected to work closely with each other to help achieve performance agreements and share best practice.</p>

<p>45. Grant Recipients may outsource elements of their <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative to one or more Activity Delivery Partners as they see fit.  Activity Delivery Partners will report to the Grant Recipient on delivery of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant including agreed outcome measures and performance, ensuring that the appropriate number and quality of staff is maintained at all times.</p>

<p>46.  It remains the responsibility of the Grant Recipient to meet all obligations of the Grant Recipient under the Grant Funding Agreement. This includes effective performance management of any Activity Delivery Partner the Grant Recipient uses to meet agreed performance expectations.</p>

<p>47.  Each Grant Recipient must ensure that in carrying out the Funded Activities, it complies with all of its obligations under the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 including, but not limited to any records relating to the Participants and the Participants’ involvement with the Initiative.</p>

<p>48. Grant Recipients must acknowledge and act in accordance with their duty of care to protect vulnerable adults enrolled on the Initiative during all activities related to it.  This includes ensuring that all Grant Recipient staff, Activity Delivery Partners and employers are appropriately trained and that sufficient background checks have been carried out to safeguard Participants in line with the Grant Recipient’s existing safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults.</p>

<p>49. Grant Recipients will be required to collect <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> to support <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant payments and validation of payment.</p>

<p>50. All communications with Grant Recipients will be issued to the Grant Recipient’s Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SpoC</abbr>). It is the responsibility of Grant Recipients to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of any change to <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SpoC</abbr> details.</p>

<p>51. Grant Recipients must, as appropriate and practical, reference that the Grant is funded by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or UK Government in any publicity material, including online channels and media releases. Materials produced by Grant Recipients must not adversely affect the reputation of the initiative or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> or the government, for example Grant Recipients should not produce marketing materials, communications or messages which could lead to adverse media attention or could be misunderstood or misinterpreted.</p>

<p>52. Grant Recipients must ensure that all Participants can access information and must ensure such information is available in a variety of alternative formats which may be requested by Participants.</p>

<p>53. Any complaints and conflict management in relation to Funded Activities must be handled by Grant Recipients in line with their established complaints management policies and procedures.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Plans</h2>

<p>54. It is expected that Grant Recipients will undertake their own robust local impact evaluations. We expect to see local theories of change or logic models of delivery plans and outcomes as part of Grant Applications, alongside high-level evaluation plans and commitment to deliver these. Local evaluations are a means through which Grant Recipients can demonstrate both the value for money and the impact of their intervention in their local context. This will form a core part of any future dialogue with funders, once the Funding Period ends and needs to be designed-in at the outset to future-proof your business case for continuing the intervention beyond the Funding Period.</p>

<p>55. Evaluation should be proportionate, and it is suggested it could cost up to 5% of Grant Funding. Guidance and resources on how to create logic models and develop local evaluation plans can be found at the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth](https://whatworksgrowth.org/resources/) website<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. The performance measures set for the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant will inform the outcomes and impact of your theory of change/logic model.</p>

<p>56. It is also expected that you would participate in any national evaluation that is decided upon as a condition of receiving the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant. This might include analysis of Management Information and a theory-based evaluation into best-practice delivery mechanisms. The research would focus on establishing the employment, health and wellbeing outcomes for participants, the causal mechanisms between delivery structures, local relationships, and a cost-benefit analysis. Guidance on evaluation can be found in the Magenta Book<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Fidelity Reviews / <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow</h2>

<p>57. <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow is a national programme that supports <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> services to achieve high quality provision and high levels of employment outcomes (see www.ipsgrow.org.uk for further information).</p>

<p>58. <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow support for Grant Recipients or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner can include implementation support, quality assurance fidelity reviews and technical on-site support. The specific details of the support, including implementation support will be discussed and agreed with successful Grant Applicants.</p>

<p>59. The purpose of the Fidelity Review is to provide expert assistance to support the development and delivery of evidence based <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> employment services across the health system. Evidence indicates that services achieving higher <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> fidelity scores typically deliver higher levels of job outcomes</p>

<p>60. It is expected that each Grant Recipient (or their Activity Delivery Partner(s)) should undertake up to two Fidelity Reviews during the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant, fully engaging with the review process, including completing the improvements outlined in fidelity action plans, and fully utilising the support on offer from <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow. Each Activity Delivery Partner should be assessed separately.</p>

<p>61. All Fidelity Reviews will use the 25 item <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ipsgrow.org.uk/providers/fidelity-reviews/" rel="external">Supported Employment Fidelity Scale for quality improvement</a> on the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow website.</p>

<p>62. A Fidelity Review report will be provided by <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow, which will include recommendations on how the delivery of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> can be improved. These reports will be shared with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to work with each Grant Recipient to support implementation of the recommendations.</p>

<p>63. Information on implementation will be provided to successful Grant Recipients once these have been decided. Some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ipsgrow.org.uk/providers/fidelity-reviews/" rel="external">useful information</a> can be found on the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow website.</p>

<h2>Engagement</h2>

<p>64. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will facilitate invitations to regular regional workshops and teleconferences with Grant Recipients throughout the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative, including some face to face, allowing Grant Recipients to share their experiences and help each other to deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> effectively, maximise agreed outcomes and help resolve issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to hold a MS Teams call with all the potential Grant Applicants’ representatives who have submitted an expression of interest form for the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant for potential Grant Applicants to ask questions prior to submitting a Grant Application</li>

<ul>
  <li>The first face-to-face workshops will be delivered (dates and locations to be confirmed) once successful Grant Recipients are known</li>
  <li>Follow up meetings and teleconferences are expected to take place on a regular basis as and when required</li>
  <li>Grant Recipients will be asked to attend checkpoints via teleconference with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> throughout the Implementation Period and delivery phases</li>
</ul>

<p>65. Each Grant Recipient will be assigned and made aware of their Regional Engagement Lead (<abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr>), who will work with Grant Recipients, share good practice, and provide ongoing support to Grant Recipients throughout the Initiative Implementation Period and delivery phases.</p>

<p>66.  <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> support will continue throughout the Funding Period.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>67. Participants for <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will come from 2 distinct cohorts. Out-of-Work Participants who require assistance and support to move into sustainable employment, and In-Work Participants who are employed and either off sick or struggling in the workplace due to their disability.</p>

<p>68. We propose that the Initiative should be aimed at people who meet the following Eligibility Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a physical or mental health disability as defined by the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>are willing to participate in <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> to remain in paid work or be willing to find and sustain paid work</li>
  <li>are not currently receiving employment support, other than from Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>are not on another <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employment programme or provision</li>
  <li>may or may not be in receipt of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits</li>
  <li>are of working age</li>
  <li>if already in-work, must have been employed for at least 6 months before starting <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> and be working a <strong>minimum of 7 hours per week</strong>; and</li>
  <li>have an entitlement to public funds</li>
</ul>

<p>69. This Initiative will be particularly suitable for those who have common mental health and/or physical health disabilities and are disengaged from the labour market because they believe they cannot secure or maintain employment.</p>

<p>70. Participants must not be on another <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employment programme or provision. For example, this includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Individual Personalised Employment Support (<abbr title="Individual Personalised Employment Support">IPES</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Local Services and Regionally based support</li>
  <li>Employment Advisors in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (<abbr title="Improving Access to Psychological Therapies">IAPT</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>71. Participants on a programme or provision delivered by another government department, charitable trust, or Third Party, which is not primarily focused on employment, would be eligible for <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> as long as they are still able to fully participate in the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative and that it would not be detrimental to either provision and there was no Duplicate Funding. These instances will be looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>72. Activity Delivery Partners must complete an eligibility check for each proposed Participant. In this check the Activity Delivery Partner should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Confirm the Participant meets the Eligibility Criteria for <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> and is suitable for the Initiative, including agreeing with the Participant that they agree to the voluntary activities required, including completing a Vocational Action Plan</li>
</ul>

<p>73. This step is important to ensure that Participants will benefit from <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> and includes confirmation of eligibility/suitability for all potential Participants including self–referrals. Participants who are not eligible/suitable should be signposted to other support as appropriate.</p>

<p>74. Check that the Participant is not already in receipt of employment support. If they have any doubt about this, they should take steps to verify using local information/contacts.</p>

<p>75. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may conduct a post eligibility check of a sample of Initiative Starts to verify Eligibility Criteria is met and discuss this as part of performance reviews.</p>

<p>76. An example Participant journey is at Annex A.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant Funding</h2>

<p>77. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant will be paid to the respective Grant Recipient Quarterly in arrears based on the financial profile of the Grant Recipient and the achievement of profiled key performance indicators (<abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>).</p>

<p>78. Grant Applicants need to profile potential Initiative Starts over the first 20 months of the Funding Period.</p>

<p>79. To manage <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> internal yearly budget allocations some payments may need to be deferred to the following year, if a Grant Recipient exceeds its projected profile of Initiative Starts.</p>

<p>80. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant will be paid as one combined Quarterly payment.  Payment may be withheld if a Grant Recipient fails to meet agreed performance targets once all other avenues of performance management have been exhausted.</p>

<p>81. Funding provided by a Third Party to the Grant Recipient, which is for the same purpose for which the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant is made but has not been declared to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, represents Duplicate Funding and is prohibited.</p>

<h3>Set Up costs</h3>

<p>82.  A set up payment will be available for all Grant Recipients.  Each Grant Recipient will be able to apply for set up costs of up to 10% of the total grant value. The payment will be based on an invoice of actual costs. This payment will be available for existing trial sites/areas at a rate of 5% of total grant value.</p>

<h3>Eligible Expenditure</h3>

<p>83. Funding can be used for all costs directly associated with the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scheme administration costs</li>
  <li>Staffing costs, including recruitment</li>
  <li>Marketing/advertising including webpage design</li>
  <li>Training of staff and Participants</li>
  <li>Employment events such as job fairs</li>
  <li>Transport costs where a Participant would not otherwise be able to attend employment/training</li>
  <li>Costs associated with providing care for Participants</li>
  <li>Costs associated with Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly CRB (Criminal Records Bureau))">DBS</abbr>) checks</li>
  <li>Childcare or replacement caring costs. See below for further details</li>
</ul>

<p>84. Grant Recipients should signpost Participants towards agencies who can support Participants with appropriate advice. This could include helping Participants to access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Access to Work Programme, where appropriate.</p>

<p>85. To be considered Eligible Expenditure under <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>, all costs must be over and above any existing form of <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> provision including <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Drugs &amp; Alcohol. For example, <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> costs must be in addition to staff delivering existing <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> services. Duplicate Funding is prohibited, therefore any intended Third-Party funding for activities that are the same or similar to the Funded Activities of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant will need to be declared as Third-Party Match Funding and will be subject to prior written consent of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>86. Grant Recipients should consider how to ensure the successful delivery of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>. This will include consideration of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facilitating workshops with GPs and relevant other primary and community care pathways, supporting the ongoing engagement of GP (General Practitioner) and clinicians throughout the project</li>
  <li>Wider stakeholder engagement to promote <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Liaising with national and international <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> experts to adapt fidelity guidelines for primary and community care</li>
  <li>Liaising with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, DH, and NHS England and access to national support and expertise</li>
  <li>Centralised data analysis, dependent on timely and consistent reporting from provider(s) and</li>
  <li>Operational support from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and other experts to help resolve issues in delivery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Marketing and Communication of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>87. Grant Recipients must consider how to promote <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> including ensuring it is recognised across the locality, in particular with hard-to-reach communities. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring easy access to information on the trial, through social, online and print media</li>
  <li>making information about the trial accessible in formats suitable for people with sensory impairment and/or in other languages</li>
  <li>working closely with community and primary care teams to promote the trial; making use of existing or new networks to promote <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> across the health and employment systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partnerships and networks</h3>

<p>88. Partnership working is considered essential to the success of the trial and therefore Grant Recipients will be expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be committed to developing and maintaining strong partnerships with primary and community health services, including establishing co-location and co-working arrangements with a range of clinical teams</li>
  <li>demonstrate, through outcomes, practices, policies, and procedures, a commitment to working with service users with a variety of health conditions in the design, delivery, and evaluation of all services</li>
</ul>

<p>89. The Initiative should be operated in a person-centred way, which requires professionals and Employment Specialist supervisors to distance themselves from traditional roles as ‘experts’ and ‘providers,’ into partnership models that work with ‘individuals’ and ‘communities.</p>

<h3>Staffing and recruitment</h3>

<p>90. Recruiting a large number of high-quality staff will be a critical success factor for this Initiative. Key roles will include the <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr>’s and Team Leaders.  Grant Applicants will need to consider and demonstrate in their Grant Application the ability to attract capable staff to deliver the initiative.</p>

<p>91. The Grant Recipient and their Activity Delivery Partners will need to determine the precise support to be offered, but this is likely to include a region-wide recruitment marketing effort, the development and delivery of a rigorous, standardised assessment process, and the development and delivery of a comprehensive, standardised induction training package to ensure all managers and frontline staff have a similar understanding of the intervention model.</p>

<h3>Childcare costs</h3>

<p>92. Where it is a barrier to participation in the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative, childcare should be funded by the Grant Recipient as part of its Grant Funding. Childcare should only be funded if it is provided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carers registered with <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">OFSTED</abbr> (Office for Standards in Education)</li>
  <li>A carer accredited under the Childcare Approval Scheme, run on school premises out of school hours or as an out of hours club by a Local Authority, or</li>
  <li>Schools or establishments exempted from registration under the Children Act 1989 or operated on Crown property</li>
</ul>

<p>93. The Grant Recipient will be required to ensure that Participants are informed of the access to funding for childcare costs.</p>

<p>94. The parent or guardian can make alternative arrangements. However, costs should not be paid unless the carer is in one of the above categories.</p>

<p>95. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> currently sets its costs for childcare up to the Tax Credit limits. Grant Recipients should consider the following limits when developing and pricing their proposals:</p>

<p>a.	Help with childcare costs can be paid up to, but not including, the first Tuesday in the September following the child’s fifteenth birthday.  Parents requiring childcare for five days a week can claim up to a maximum of £175 per week for one child and £300 per week for two or more children.</p>

<p>b.	If the Participant is attending an Approved Activity of less than five days a week, they can claim up to the maximum daily rates of £35 per day for one child and £60 per day for two or more children.</p>

<p>96. The child/children must satisfy the age requirement and be a dependent of and reside with the Participant.</p>

<p>97. Grant Recipients must not recommend childcare facilities to Participants. This is to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and/or the Grant Recipient does not take on liability for the safety of children. It is the parents’ responsibility to decide with whom they entrust the care of their child/children.</p>

<p>98. Grant Recipients or Activity Delivery Partners may choose to arrange for a crèche facility to be on their premises. However, they must ensure it is the parents’ choice whether their child uses the facility. Grant Recipients should also ensure that any crèche facilities adhere to current legislation.</p>

<h3>Replacement Care Costs</h3>

<p>99. Where it is a barrier to participation in the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative, replacement care costs can be funded by the Grant Recipient as part of its Grant Funding for participants who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of working age</li>
  <li>not in work; and</li>
  <li>spend a significant proportion of their lives providing unpaid support to relatives, partners or friends who are ill, frail, disabled or have a mental health or substance misuse problem</li>
</ul>

<p>100. Carers must be participating in an Approved Activity and/or incur one-off replacement care costs when attending an interview with a Grant Recipient or employer which has been pre-arranged/agreed by the Grant Recipient. Other alternatives, such as moving the time/date, should be considered before replacement care costs are paid.</p>

<p>101. The Grant Recipient will be required to ensure that Participants are informed of the access to funding for replacement caring costs.</p>

<p>102. Replacement care costs should not be paid if the replacement care is provided by family members.</p>

<p>103. Replacement care must be provided by Grant Recipient registered providers, a Grant Recipient preferred provider, or a recognised care organisation within the local area.</p>

<p>104. Grant Recipients must not recommend replacement care to Participants. The carer, or the person being cared for, must do this, as it is their responsibility to decide who should provide the care.</p>

<h3>Ineligible Expenses</h3>

<p>105. Ineligible expenditure shall include but not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any contribution to the Participant’s salary</li>
  <li>The cost of submitting a Grant Application</li>
  <li>Incentives paid to Participants</li>
  <li>Contributions in kind</li>
  <li>Interest payments or service charge payments for finance leases</li>
  <li>Gifts.</li>
  <li>Statutory fines, criminal fines or penalties civil penalties, damages, or any associated legal costs</li>
  <li>Payments for works or activities which the Grant Recipient, or any member of their Partnership has a statutory duty to undertake, or that are funded by other sources</li>
  <li>Bad debts to related parties</li>
  <li>Payments for unfair dismissal or other compensation</li>
  <li>Depreciation, amortisation, or impairment of assets owned by the Grant Recipient</li>
  <li>The acquisition or improvement of Assets by the Grant Recipient and</li>
  <li>Liabilities incurred before the commencement of the Grant Funding Agreement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fraud</h2>

<p>106. Grant Recipients should ensure that Activity Delivery Partners are genuine, qualified, and capable of delivering the required Funded Activities, and that the use of the Activity Delivery Partner by the Grant Recipient represents value for money. This may include the Grant Recipient carrying out due diligence, pre-procurement checks, ongoing performance management of all Activity Delivery Partners and the Grant Recipient making payments in arrears to all Activity Delivery Partners.</p>

<p>107. If the Grant Recipient knows or suspects, or should have known or suspected, that fraudulent activity of any kind has taken place in connection with <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> or the Grant, the Grant Recipient must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> immediately providing full details of the fraudulent activity, including but not limited to, the nature, the scope, and the total monetary value of the fraudulent activity.</p>

<h2>VAT</h2>

<p>108. The Grant Recipient should seek its own independent advice regarding the VAT implications of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant.</p>

<p>109. If Grant Recipients elect to charge VAT on payments made to them by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> then they must provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with full VAT invoices alongside the <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> at he next reporting period.</p>

<p>110. If Grant Recipients incur VAT from Activity Delivery Partners or Third-Party suppliers, this remains the responsibility of the Grant Recipient. VAT costs incurred by the Grant Recipient should not be passed on to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and VAT costs incurred by the Grant Recipient do not constitute Eligible Expenditure.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>111. The deadline for submitting a Grant Application is at 17:00 on 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>112. Information and support regarding the Grant Application process can be obtained by sending questions to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Grant Team via the following inbox throughout the grant application process: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:individualplacementsupportfund@dwp.gov.uk">individualplacementsupportfund@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>113. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to assess Grant Applications in July and notify Grant Applicants of the outcome by the October 2022. It is expected that Grant Recipients will then begin the procurement process for Activity Delivery Partners and training partners, if applicable, as well as resourcing and staff training.  Grant Recipients will have a 6-month Implementation Period before beginning to deliver the Initiative from April 2023 to March 2025. More details are provided in the table below. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will make every effort to notify Grant Applicants as early as possible in the event that the timeline needs to be adjusted.</p>

<h2>Implementation Period</h2>

<p>114. During the Implementation Period, Grant Recipients should deliver the activities outlined in their Grant Application, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Procurement and appointment of Activity Delivery Partners and training partners, if applicable</li>
  <li>Relevant recruitment and training carried out</li>
  <li>Development of supporting processes and procedures ready for service</li>
  <li>Marketing of the <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Initiative</li>
  <li>Regular engagement with the <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to support service set-up</li>
</ul>

<h2>Funding Period</h2>

<p>115. The Funding Period runs from 3 April 2023 to 31 March 2025 and is made up of two phases: recruitment phase and support phase.</p>

<p>116. During the recruitment phase Grant Recipients will be seeking to identify potential <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> Participants, establishing eligibility, and supporting Participants either in their job search and into employment, or to remain in employment.</p>

<p>117.  The Grant Recipient will recruit Participants for 20 months and offer support for 24 months. There will be no recruitment in the final 4 months. The <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> will provide a maximum of 12 months support to an Out-of-Work Participant, and 4-months support to an In-Work Participant.</p>

<p>118. At the transition point from recruitment phase to support phase, if the Grant Recipient feels there are reasonable grounds for admitting further Initiative Starts, this can be discussed with the <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> and will be considered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>119. During the support phase of the Grant, the Grant Recipient should consider how to take the necessary steps to close the Initiative and as appropriate, transition Participants to alternative support.</p>

<h2>Identification and Referral Process</h2>

<p>120. The core target referral routes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Self-referral signposted from wider local services e.g., Voluntary and Charity Sector, employers and Jobcentre Plus (web, telephone, in-person)</li>
  <li>Primary care (GPs, practice nurses, allied health professions, other primary care staff members)</li>
  <li>Community care and other care settings (<abbr title="Improving Access to Psychological Therapies">IAPT</abbr>, pain clinics, physio and other community care services, psychology, psychotherapy), and social prescribing</li>
</ul>

<p>121.   To ensure that the right levels and quality of referrals is achieved, Activity Delivery Partners will need to consider how to manage all referral routes effectively. This will include developing strong links and referral arrangements with community organisations, health services, local partners such as GPs, ICS and other <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>, Jobcentre Plus, social care, community health services, educational institutions, volunteering organisations, and housing services among others.</p>

<h2>Grant Recipient / Activity Delivery Partner interaction with Participant</h2>

<h3>Initial meeting with Participant</h3>

<p>122. The initial meeting with the Participant following referral will be critical to delivering <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> effectively.</p>

<p>123. The Activity Delivery Partner will need to check and agree Participant eligibility and suitability and collect relevant initial information about the Participant. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> provision is expected to conform to the modified version of the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> 8 key principles (paragraph 24).</p>

<p>124. The initial meeting must be conducted face-to-face by the <abbr title="Employment Specialist">ES</abbr> who will deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>. This should be at an agreed location that meets the preferences and requirements of the Participant, including consideration of the accessibility requirements of the Participant e.g., a community location the reasons for this meeting being face-to-face are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this is in line with the principle of rapid engagement, which has been shown to be an important part of <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>increases the chances of the Participants not dropping out</li>
</ul>

<p>125. Grant Recipients will be expected to make provision for Participants that do not have English as a first language. Grant Recipients will be expected to budget for translation services or other provision as appropriate to ensure they are able to reach the broadest range of potential Participants.</p>

<h3>Informed Consent</h3>
