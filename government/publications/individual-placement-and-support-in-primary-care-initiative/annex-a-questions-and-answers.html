<h2>Question 1: What is the purpose of the Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care Initiative?</h2>
<p>   
Answer 1: In existing <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> programmes, <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and other organisations work with people who have severe mental health issues on an individual basis, place them into employment and provide support to them to remain in employment. The <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> initiative will aim to build on evidence from the Health Led Trials which adapted the traditional <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> model to provide support for people with mild to moderate, common mental and physical health disabilities. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> will not only be available for people out of work but those in work and struggling with their health.</p>

<h2>Question 2: Who is eligible to receive support?</h2>

<p>Answer 2: The initiative is aimed at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a physical or mental health disability as defined by the Equality Act 2010.</li>
  <li>be of Working Age.</li>
  <li>be willing to participate in <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> to remain in paid work or to be willing to find and sustain paid work.</li>
  <li>not currently be receiving employment support, other than from Jobcentre Plus, and</li>
  <li>not be participating in another employment programme or provision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligibility is not affected by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receipt of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefits, or</li>
  <li>employment status.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 3: How much grant funding will each Grant Recipient receive?</h2>

<p>Answer 3: Funding of up to £40million has been allocated to deliver <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr>.  Applications should include a clear rationale that justifies and explains the number of participants that an authority is able to provide support for.</p>

<h2>Question 4: What are the Fidelity requirements for <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>?</h2>
<p>  
Answer 4: Delivering against a fidelity model supports services to implement <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> effectively. This should increase job outcomes and support a culture of continuous improvement. <abbr title="Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care">IPSPC</abbr> services and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will work with <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow (Home - <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Grow) who will provide tailored advice and support to each Grant Recipient to fulfil the fidelity requirement for this initiative.</p>

<h2>Question 5: How much information will <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> need to provide with their funding bid?</h2>

<p>Answer 5: <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required to complete a short Grant Application template including details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Service design</li>
  <li>Participant support</li>
  <li>Activity delivery</li>
  <li>Implementation</li>
  <li>Delivering supported employment</li>
  <li>Local Integration</li>
  <li>Data handling</li>
  <li>Future plans</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 6: What MI do I need to collect and return to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>?</h2>

<p>Answer 6: There will be a template to complete and return to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> each month. This will include and is not limited to; staff numbers, participant numbers, provision starts, job starts, and hours worked. A summary of the costs incurred by the Grant Recipient will be required each quarter.  Grant Recipients will need to retain evidence to provide assurance relating to hours worked, earnings and duration of employment. More information will be provided with the invitation to apply together with the MI reporting template.</p>

<h2>Question 7: What support will I receive from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>?</h2>
<p>  
Answer 7: The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Grants Team will support authorities through the Grant Application process by providing points of clarification as required.</p>

<p>After the successful bids have been selected, a Regional Engagement Lead (<abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr>) appointed to each <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>. The <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> will provide support through the implementation process, share good practice across locations and facilitate workshops where <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> may share experiences and help each other to resolve issues. <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> support will continue throughout the 24-month service delivery period.</p>

<h2>Question 8: What are the 8 <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Principle?</h2>

<p>Answer 8: The HLIPS approach is based on a modified version of the <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> eight key principles:</p>

<p>1.	It aims to get people into employment in the open labour market</p>

<p>2.	It is open to eligible people who want to work</p>

<p>3.	It aims to find jobs consistent with people’s preferences</p>

<p>4.	It works quickly – a place then train model of rapid activation and job search alongside delivery of work, health, and wider support needs</p>

<p>5.	It brings <abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Employment Specialists into clinical teams</p>

<p>6.	<abbr title="Individual Placement Support">IPS</abbr> Employment Specialists develop relationships with employers based upon a person’s work preferences</p>

<p>7.	It provides time limited, individualised support for the person and their employer</p>

<p>8.	Access to specialist benefits advice is included</p>
