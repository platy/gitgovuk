<h3>What is COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna and what is it used for?</h3>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is a vaccine indicated for active immunisation to prevent coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<h3>How does COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna work?</h3>
<p>COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system) and causes the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus. None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID 19.</p>

<h3>How is COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna used?</h3>
<p>The pharmaceutical form of this medicine is a dispersion for injection and the route of administration is intramuscular injection. COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna will be given to you by an authorised practitioner as an intramuscular injection into the muscle at the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle).</p>

<p>You will receive 2 injections of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna, each of 0.5ml. It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first.</p>

<p>For further information on how COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is used, refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna">Information for UK recipients on COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna" class="govuk-link">Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</a> available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) website.</p>

<p>This vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.</p>

<p>The patient should ask the administering healthcare practitioner if they have any questions concerning the vaccine.</p>

<h3>What benefits of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna have been shown in studies?</h3>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was given to approximately 14,000 individuals aged 18 years or older in clinical study. The study included participants with one or more other medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease, such as chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease or HIV infection.</p>

<p>In the primary efficacy analysis, there were 11 cases of COVID-19 reported in the vaccine group compared with 185 cases reported in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 was 94.1%. These results were observed starting 2 weeks after the second dose in study participants with no evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

<p>The level of protection gained after dose 1 was assessed in an exploratory analysis. In the interval 14 days after dose 1 to dose 2, there were 35 cases of COVID-19 on placebo and only 2 in the vaccine group. This indicates a high level of protection from 14 days after the first dose and before receiving dose 2.</p>

<p>The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was consistent between older subjects (≥65 years) and younger subjects (18-64 years).</p>

<h3>What are the possible side effects of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna?</h3>
<p>The most common side effects with COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are injection site pain, feeling tired (fatigue), headache, muscle ache or joint pain.</p>

<p>For the full list of all side effects reported with this medicine, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-uk-recipients-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna">Information for UK recipients on COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-covid-19-vaccine-moderna">Information for Healthcare Professionals on COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</a> available on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> website.</p>

<h3>Why was COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna approved?</h3>
<p>It was concluded that COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna has been shown to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Furthermore, the side effects observed with use of this product are considered to be similar to those seen for vaccines. Therefore, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> concluded that the benefits are greater than the risks and recommended that this medicine can be authorised for temporary supply during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h3>What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna?</h3>
<p>All new medicines approved require a Risk Management Plan (<abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>) to ensure they are used as safely as possible. An <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> has been agreed for the use of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna in the UK.  Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the Information for UK Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.</p>

<p>All side effects reported by patients/healthcare professionals are continuously monitored. Any new safety signals identified will be reviewed and, if necessary, appropriate regulatory action will be taken. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has also put in place an additional proactive safety monitoring plan for all COVID-19 vaccines to enable rapid analysis of safety information which is important during a pandemic.</p>

<h3>Other information about COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</h3>
<p>Authorisation for the temporary supply of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna was granted in the UK on 8 January 2021.</p>

<p>The full public assessment report for COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna follows this summary.</p>

<p>This summary was last updated 18 January 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This report is based on the information provided by the company in a rolling data submission procedure and it covers the authorisation for temporary supply of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna. At the time of writing, the company have provided sufficient information to make a decision on the vaccine but final reports for all studies have not yet been received. Quality aspects of the vaccine are reviewed on a batch-specific basis.</p>

<p>In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China and in January 2020, a novel coronavirus was discovered as the underlying cause. Infections by the virus, named SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting disease, COVID-19, have spread globally.
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic.</p>

<p>The number of COVID-19 cases in the UK now stands at more than 3 million and over 80,000 deaths have been attributed to the disease. The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at particular risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19. A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has recently been identified which has a higher transmission rate than the other variants in circulation. Currently there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or higher mortality. Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention to decrease risk and reduce spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is leading the Government’s deployment of vaccinations against COVID-19. In order to save lives, and to reduce the number of people who need hospital treatment due to COVID-19, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> have sought to deploy a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. In a letter dated 24 December 2020, the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> requested authorisation, on a temporary basis, of its proposed supply of a vaccine manufactured by Moderna Biotech Spain, S.L. named “COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna”, under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (“the Regulations”).</p>

<p>Following an extensive review of the quality, safety and efficacy data, COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna has been authorised for temporary supply in the UK for the following indication: active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna is a dispersion for injection intended for intramuscular administration (<abbr title="intramuscular">IM</abbr>). COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna multiple-dose vials are stored at  25°C to -15°C until ready for use. Vials are packed in cartons containing ten multiple-dose vials per carton. Each vial contains 10 doses (each 0.5 mL).</p>

<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses proteins on its outer surface, called spike (S) proteins, to enter the cells of the body and cause disease. COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna contains the genetic code for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Following vaccine administration, the lipid nanoparticle delivers the mRNA to cells of the body. The mRNA encodes for the spike protein mRNA sequence and is translated within the cells and produces the spike protein of SARS CoV 2. The spike protein is then expressed on the surface of the cells which induces neutralising antibodies and T-cells to be raised against it. Should the body then become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the immune system will recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and attack it.</p>

<p>The authorisation is for specific batches of the vaccine, after confirmation that detailed conditions are met. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/conditions-of-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccine-moderna" class="govuk-link">conditions</a> are published on the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> website.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has been assured that acceptable standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (<abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr>) are in place for this product at all sites responsible for the manufacture, analysis, assembly and batch release of this product.</p>

<p>A Risk Management Plan (<abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>) and a summary of the pharmacovigilance system have been provided with this application and are satisfactory.</p>

<p>This batch, and any future batches, of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna are subject to Qualified Person (<abbr title="Qualified Person">QP</abbr>) certification and batch evaluation by an independent control laboratory before the vaccine is released into the UK.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Benefit Risk Expert Working Group (Vaccine <abbr title="Benefit Risk Expert Working Group">BR EWG</abbr>) have met several times to review and discuss the quality, safety and efficacy aspects in relation to batches of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>

<p>The Vaccine <abbr title="Benefit Risk Expert Working Group">BR EWG</abbr> gave advice to the Commission of Human Medicines (<abbr title="Commission of Human Medicines">CHM</abbr>) on 20 November 2020, 7 December 2020, 17 December 2020, 22 December 2020, 24 December 2020 and 31 December 2020, regarding the requirements for authorisation for the temporary supply of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna. The requirements for quality, safety and efficacy were considered, taking into account the urgent public health need and risk to life, the pandemic situation and a lack of COVID-19 vaccines. As well as data on quality, safety and efficacy, specific conditions on the product were discussed to ensure adequate standards of quality and safety are met.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Commission of Human Medicines">CHM</abbr> concluded that the proposed supply of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna for active immunisation to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older, is recommended to be suitable for approval under Regulation 174 provided the company meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-moderna/conditions-of-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccine-moderna">conditions</a> set out by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/moderna-vaccine-becomes-third-covid-19-vaccine-approved-by-uk-regulator" class="govuk-link">Authorisation for the temporary supply of COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna was granted in the UK on 8 January 2021</a>. This report covers data received and reviewed for this authorisation only. This authorisation is valid until expressly withdrawn by <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> or upon issue of a marketing authorisation.</p>

<p>Whilst an acceptable level of information has been received to provide assurance that appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy have been met for authorisation of specific batches for temporary supply under Regulation 174 of the Regulations, it should be noted that COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna remains under review as <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> continues to receive data from the company as it becomes available. This will include, for example, long-term follow-up efficacy and safety data. Further information that is received by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will be reviewed as part of the ongoing assessment for this product and updates will be made to this <abbr title="Public Assessment Report">PAR</abbr> to reflect that in due course.</p>

The drug product is supplied in a multidose vial presentation, containing 10 doses per vial. The vaccine is supplied ready-to-use and no dilution of the product is required.</p>

<p>COVID 19 Vaccine Moderna is presented in type 1 glass vials, or Type I equivalent alkali-aluminosilicate glass vials, closed with chlorobutyl stoppers and sealed with aluminium overseals. Each vial contains 6.3 mL fill volume to allow withdrawal of 10 doses of 0.5 mL (each containing 0.10 mg mRNA). The drug product vials are packaged in 10 multidose vials in a carton.</p>

<h3>Pharmaceutical development</h3>
<p>A satisfactory account of the pharmaceutical development has been provided. The development history, including process changes have been summarised. The approach to defining critical quality attributes was described, as well as process risk assessment strategy and characterisation studies.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna manufacturing process consists of the dilution of mRNA-1273 <abbr title="lipid nanoparticle">LNP</abbr> with a formulation buffer. Formulation development activities for COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna used prior knowledge from similar platform products to develop a suitable formulation for <abbr title="intramuscular">IM</abbr> injection.</p>

<p>Several preservatives were shown to be incompatible with the mRNA-1273 <abbr title="lipid nanoparticle">LNP</abbr> and absence of preservatives in the multidose vial was justified using a microbiological challenge hold time study that demonstrated no growth of selected microorganisms for up to 24 hours at room temperature.</p>

<p>Comparability assessment of drug product batches manufactured at different sites and process scales was performed according to ICH Q5E, including clinical trial and process performance qualification batches of the drug product from different sites. In addition to release testing, the manufacturer has evaluated stability and extended characterisation testing. Additional comparability data will be provided for the European manufacturing site as it becomes available.</p>

The microbial control strategy is satisfactory.</p>

<p>Drug product process performance qualification studies were presented for the US sites. Process performance qualification studies are not yet complete at the European site, however, the data provided from the first <abbr title="Good Manufacturing Practice">GMP</abbr> batch appears acceptable. Full validation study results will be provided once available. Satisfactory process qualification of the aseptic manufacturing steps for the vial filling line has been performed using media fills.</p>

<h3>Control of excipients</h3>
<p>The excipients are of compendial and non-compendial grade. In this application, the information presented on the lipids are compiled as part of the drug substance, but they were also reviewed as excipients. The other excipients are trometamol (Tris), trometamol hydrochloride (Tris-HCl), acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose and water for injections. The compendial excipients used in the formulation of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna are tested and released for use in compliance with current compendia. The non-compendial excipients are tested using analytical methods that were developed and controlled by the excipient manufacturer. Details of the manufacture and controls are provided for the novel excipients SM-102 and PEG2000-DMG.</p>

<p>The quality of excipients is appropriate for use in the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna based on their intended use. None of the excipients are of human or animal origin.</p>

<h3>Control, batch analysis and reference standards of drug product</h3>
<p>The finished product specification is given and includes relevant control parameters suitable for the finished product, although a recommendation is made to include a cell-based assay as part of release testing. Specification limits will be revised once sufficient batches have been manufactured.</p>

<p>The analytical procedures used, including compendial and non-compendial methods, to assess the RNA and lipid content, identity, purity, safety and stability of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna have been adequately described. Validation of the analytical methods used for the control of the drug product are satisfactory for ensuring compliance with the relevant specifications, although some validation reports for the European site are awaited.</p>

<p>The impurity profile of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is very similar to mRNA-1273 Lipid Nanoparticle (<abbr title="lipid nanoparticle">LNP</abbr>). No additional impurities are anticipated to form or be introduced during the manufacture of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Each of the impurities discussed for mRNA-1273 <abbr title="lipid nanoparticle">LNP</abbr> is present in COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>

<p>The reference standards described for the CX-024414 mRNA and mRNA-1273 <abbr title="lipid nanoparticle">LNP</abbr> will also serve as reference standards for the drug product.</p>

<p>A representative batch size and batch formula have been provided for the manufacture of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Batch data have been provided that comply with the release specification and demonstrate consistent results</p>

<h3>Independent batch testing</h3>
<p>Independent batch testing provides additional assurance of quality before a batch is made available to the market. Independent batch testing is a function that is undertaken by an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (<abbr title="Official Medicines Control Laboratory">OMCL</abbr>) and, under Regulation 174A, the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (<abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr>) is responsible for this function.</p>

<p>Independent batch testing is product-specific: it requires specific materials and documentation from the manufacturer and comprises laboratory-based testing and review of the manufacturer’s test data. If all tests meet the product specifications, a certificate of compliance is issued by the <abbr title="Official Medicines Control Laboratory">OMCL</abbr>. <abbr title="National Institute for Biological Standards and Control">NIBSC</abbr> will undertake the independent batch release for this product.</p>

<h3>Container closure system</h3>
<p>The bulk drug product is dispensed into clear Type 1 borosilicate glass vials or clear Type 1 equivalent alkali-aluminosilicate glass vials, closed with a 20 mm chlorobutyl rubber stopper and 20 mm flip-off red matte aluminum seal. Vials are then packaged in a secondary carton containing a total of ten COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna multidose vials per carton, with a tamper-evident seal.</p>

<p>The container closure system has been well described and complies with the relevant quality standards of the Ph. Eur.</p>

<h3>Stability</h3>
<p>Finished product stability studies have been conducted in accordance with current guidelines, using batches of the finished product stored in the packaging proposed for marketing. Based on the results, a shelf-life of 7 months (frozen between -25 °C to -15 °C) is acceptable. Once thawed, the medicinal product should not be re-frozen and may be stored refrigerated at 2 °C to 8 °C protected from light for up to 30 days if not used (i.e. not needle-punctured). Stability data has been provided to support the total time out of refrigeration (8 to 25 °C) of 12 hours.</p>

<p>Once the vial has been used (punctured), the vaccine should be used within 6 hours, since this is an unpreserved product. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. Note that if 6 hours is needed for administration of the vaccine, this time should be within the total time of 12 hours out of refrigeration.</p>

<p>Suitable post approval stability commitments have been requested to continue stability testing on batches of finished product.</p>

<p>The following precautions for storage are to be followed:</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna multidose vials are stored frozen between -25 °C to -15 °C until ready for use. Do not store on dry ice or below -40 ºC.</p>

<p>Remove the required number of vials from freezer storage and thaw each vial before use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thaw in refrigerated conditions between 2 °C to 8 °C for 2.5 hours. Let each vial stand at room temperature for 15 minutes before administering.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, thaw at room temperature between 15 °C to 25 °C for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Do not re-freeze vials after thawing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Swirl the vial gently after thawing and between each withdrawal. Do not shake.</p>

<p>Chemical and physical stability of an unopened vial after removal from refrigerated conditions has been demonstrated for 12 hours at 8° to 25°C. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2 to 25 ºC after first puncture. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.</p>
