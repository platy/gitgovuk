  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moderna are not only responsible for compliance with the conditions expressly applied to Moderna in this authorisation but also, where the conditions apply legislation or guidance that confers responsibilities on marketing authorisation holders, for compliance with any responsibility however worded that applies to a marketing authorisation holder in the applied legislation or guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
