<h3>Reporting of side effects</h3>

<p>As with any new medicine in the UK this product will be closely monitored to allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.</p>

<p>Read all of this leaflet carefully before the vaccine is given because it contains important information for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.</li>
  <li>If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</li>
  <li>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is and what it is used for</h2>

<h3>What is COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</h3>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.  It is given to adults aged 18 years and older. The active substance in COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein embedded in lipid nanoparticles.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<h3>How the vaccine works</h3>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna uses a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to deliver the set of instructions that cells in the body can use to make antibodies to help fight the virus that causes COVID-19. This will help to protect against COVID-19.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may not fully protect all those who receive it. You may not be fully protected until 2 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. It is not yet known how long protection lasts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	What you need to know before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</h2>

<p>Do not have the vaccine if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>

<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have any allergies. If you have experienced a severe allergic reaction after the first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, you should not receive a second dose.</li>
  <li>have a very weak or compromised immune system, such as due to HIV infection, or are on a medicine that affects your immune system</li>
  <li>have a bleeding problem, bruise easily or use a medicine to inhibit blood clotting</li>
  <li>have a high fever or severe infection. However, a mild fever or upper airway infection, like a cold, are not reasons to delay vaccination.</li>
  <li>have any serious illness</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or
nurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>

<h3>Children and adolescents</h3>

<p>This vaccine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age as it has not been studied in this population.</p>

<h3>Other medicines and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</h3>

<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccines. COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may affect the way other medicines or vaccines work, and other medicines or vaccines may affect how COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna works.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>

<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before being vaccinated.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>

<p>It is not known if COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna affects your ability to drive or use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna contains sodium</h3>

<p>Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains less than 23 mg sodium per dose of 0.5 mL and is essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	How you will be given COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna</h2>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna will be given to you as two 0.5 mL injections. It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first.</p>

<p>Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your upper arm.</p>

<p>During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you for around 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>When COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna is given for the first injection, COVID-19 Vaccine
Moderna (and not another vaccine against COVID-19) should be given for the second injection to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>If you miss an appointment for your 2nd dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you miss an appointment, tell your doctor or nurse and arrange another visit</li>
  <li>If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected from COVID-19 virus</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Possible side effects</h2>

<p>Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects go away within a few days of appearing. If side effects such as pain and/or fever are troublesome, they can be treated by medicines for pain and fever such as paracetamol.</p>

<p>You may very rarely experience a severe allergic reaction after receiving COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. Contact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately or go to the nearest hospital emergency department right away if you have an allergic reaction. It can be life-threatening.</p>
