<p>Spikevax dispersion for injection
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (nucleoside modified)</p>

<p>This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.</p>

<p>Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.</li>
  <li>If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</li>
  <li>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What Spikevax is and what it is used for</h2>

<h3>What is Spikevax</h3>

<p>Spikevax is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to adults and children aged 12 years and older. The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM-102 lipid nanoparticles.</p>

<p>As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<h3>How the vaccine works</h3>

<p>Spikevax stimulates the body’s natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	What you need to know before you are given Spikevax</h2>

<p>The vaccine must not be given if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine, listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#ingredients">section 6</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>

<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Spikevax in the past</li>
  <li>have a very weak or compromised immune system</li>
  <li>have ever fainted following any needle injection.</li>
  <li>have a bleeding disorder</li>
  <li>have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold</li>
  <li>have any serious illness</li>
  <li>have anxiety related to injections</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after have been vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4).</p>

<p>These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days.</p>

<p>They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males.</p>

<p>Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur.</p>

<p>If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax.</p>

<p>As with any vaccine, the primary 2-dose vaccination course of Spikevax may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Spikevax is not recommended for children aged under 12 years.</p>

<h3>Other medicines and Spikevax</h3>

<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. Spikevax may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Spikevax works.</p>

<h3>Immunocompromised individuals</h3>

<p>If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax. The third dose may still
not provide full immunity to COVID-19 in people who are immunocompromised, and you should
continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts
should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your
doctor.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>

<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before being vaccinated.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>

<p>Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>Spikevax contains sodium</h3>

<p>Spikevax contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and, that is to say, essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	How you will be given Spikevax</h2>

<p>Spikevax will be given to you as two 0.5 mL injections. It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<h3>If you miss an appointment for your primary 2nd dose of Spikevax</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you miss an appointment, arrange another visit as soon as possible with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.</li>
  <li>If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID-19.</li>
</ul>

<p>A booster dose (0.25 mL) of Spikevax may be given at least 6 months after the second dose in
individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose of Spikevax at least 1 month after the
second dose.</p>

<p>Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your
upper arm.</p>

<p>During and after each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will watch over you
for at least 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Possible side effects</h2>

<p>Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Most side effects go away within a few days of appearing. If side effects such as pain and/or fever are troublesome, they can be treated by medicines for pain and fever such as paracetamol.</p>

<p>Get urgent medical attention if you get any of the following signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feeling faint or light-headed</li>
  <li>changes in your heartbeat</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>wheezing</li>
  <li>swelling of your lips, face, tongue or throat</li>
  <li>hives or rash</li>

<h2>The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only</h2>

<h3>Traceability</h3>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<p>$A
Spikevax should be administered by a trained healthcare professional.</p>

<p>The vaccine comes ready to use once thawed.</p>

<p>Do not shake or dilute.</p>

<p>Spikevax vials are multidose. Ten (10) doses (of 0.5mL each) or a maximum of twenty (20) doses (of 0.25mL each) can be withdrawn from each multidose vial.</p>

<p>Pierce the stopper preferably at a different site each time. Do not puncture the vial more than 20 times.</p>

<p>An additional overfill is included in each vial to ensure that 10 doses of 0.5 mL or a maximum of 20
doses of 0.25 mL can be delivered.</p>

<p>Thawed vials and filled syringes can be handled in room light conditions.</p>

<p>For the primary series, Spikevax should be administered as two 0.5 mL doses (100 microgram). It is
recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose. A third dose (0.5 mL,
100 micrograms) may be given at least 1 month after the second dose to individuals who are severely
immunocompromised.</p>

<p>A booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) of Spikevax may be given at least 6 months after a primary
series in individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>

<p>As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of Spikevax. Individuals should be observed by a healthcare professional for at least 15 minutes after vaccination.</p>

<p>There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of Spikevax with other vaccines. Spikevax must not be mixed with other vaccines or medicinal products in the same syringe.
The vaccine must be administered intramuscularly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>
