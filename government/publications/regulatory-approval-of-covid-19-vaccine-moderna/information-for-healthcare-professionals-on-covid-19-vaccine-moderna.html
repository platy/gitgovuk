<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h2>

<h4>Anaphylactic reactions</h4>

<p>Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision to manage immediate allergic reactions must always be readily available in case of an acute anaphylactic reaction following administration of the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>

<p>Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination.</p>

<p>A second dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna should not be given to those who have experienced severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, generalised urticaria) to the first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (see section 4.3).</p>

<h4>Traceability</h4>

<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>

<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>

<p>Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may be less in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Coagulation disorders</h4>

<p>As with other intramuscular injections, COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna should be given with caution in individuals with bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, or individuals currently on anticoagulant therapy, to avoid the risk of haematoma following the injection.</p>

<h4>Acute illness</h4>

<p>Immunization should be postponed in individuals with severe febrile illness or severe acute infection. Individuals with moderate or severe acute illness should be vaccinated as soon as the acute illness has improved.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>

<p>Vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown at present. Reference should be made to section 5.1.</p>

<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of the safety profile</h4>

<p>The safety of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351 participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site pain (92%), fatigue (70%), headache (65%), myalgia (62%), arthralgia (46%) chills (46%), nausea/vomiting (23%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness (10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.</p>

<p>Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to &lt; 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above. Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after the second dose than after the first dose. If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti-pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol-containing products) may be used.</p>

<h4>Tabulated list of adverse reactions</h4>

<p>The safety profile presented below is based on data generated in a placebo- controlled clinical study of 30,351 adults ≥ 18 years of age.</p>

<p>Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency:</p>

<p>Very common (≥1/10) 
Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10) 
Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) 
Rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) 
Very rare (&lt;1/10,000)</p>

<p>Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p>

<h3>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs)</h3>

<h4>System Organ Class: Blood and lymphatic system disorders</h4>

<p>Frequency: Very common</p>

<p>Adverse reactions: Lymphadenopathy</p>

<p>Lymphadenopathy was captured as axillary swelling/tenderness on the same side as the injection site.</p>

<h4>System Organ Class: Immune system disorders</h4>

<p>Frequency: Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)</p>

<p>Adverse reactions: Anaphylaxis</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis has been reported in post-marketing setting</p>

<h4>System Organ Class: Nervous system disorders</h4>

<p>Frequency: Very common</p>

<p>Adverse reactions: Headache</p>

<h4>System Organ Class: Nervous system disorders</h4>

<p>Frequency: Rare</p>

<p>Adverse reactions: Facial paralysis</p>

<p>Throughout the safety follow-up period, acute peripheral facial paralysis (or palsy) was reported by three participants in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and one participant in the placebo group. Onset in the vaccine group participants was 22 days, 28 days, and 32 days after Dose 2.</p>

<h4>System Organ Class: Gastrointestinal disorders</h4>

<p>Frequency: Very common</p>

<p>Adverse reactions: Nausea, Vomiting</p>

<h4>System Organ Class: Subcutaneous and skin disorders</h4>

<h4>System Organ Class: General disorders and administration site conditions</h4>

<p>Frequency: Rare
Adverse reactions: Swelling face</p>

<p>There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.</p>

<p>The reactogenicity and safety profile in 343 subjects receiving COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was comparable to that in subjects seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.</p>

<h4>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h4>

<p>If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow Card. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard">Google Play Store</a> and include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available.</p>

<p>Alternatively, adverse events of concern in association with COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna can be reported to Moderna on the toll-free number: 08000857562, via <a class="govuk-link" href="www.modernacovid19global.com">Moderna COVID19 Global</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Moderna and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>

<p>No case of overdose has been reported.</p>

<p>In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, covid-19 vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna encodes for the pre-fusion stabilized Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. After intramuscular injection, cells at the injection site take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into protein. The mRNA delivery system is based on the principle and observation that cells in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and express viral protein antigen(s) in the desired conformation. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. The protein undergoes post-translational modification and trafficking resulting in properly folded, fully functional Spike protein that is inserted into the cellular membrane of the expressing cell(s). The Spike protein is membrane bound, mimicking the presentation of natural infection.</p>

<p>The expressed Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognized by immune cells as a foreign antigen which elicits both T-cell and B-cell responses. The immune response to the Spike protein results in functional antibody and T-cell responses and in the generation of memory immune cell populations.</p>

<p>The specific mechanism of protection for the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains under investigation.</p>

<h4>Clinical efficacy</h4>

<p>A randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study was conducted in subjects 18 years of age and older who were at increased risk of COVID-19 disease. In addition, pre-specified cohorts of subjects who were either ≥65 years of age or 18 to &lt; 65 years of age with comorbid medical conditions were included. The study excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 6 months. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Individuals with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were also excluded. Influenza vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna.</p>

<p>A total of 30,351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 28,207 subjects who received either Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073), had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, and did not develop confirmed COVID-19 within 14 days after the second dose. The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 19.7% Hispanic or Latino, and 9.7% African American. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of –7 to +14 days was allowed for inclusion in the PPS. The proportion of vaccinees who received the second dose per protocol (-3 to +7) (25d to 35 days after dose 1) was 98%.</p>

<p>COVID-19 cases were confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and by a Clinical Adjudication Committee.</p>

<p>First *: Subjects at increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to at least one pre-existing medical condition (chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease or HIV infection), regardless of age</p>

<p>**VE and 95% CI from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model</p>

<p>***White is defined as non-Hispanic white, and communities of colour is defined as all others except those whose race and ethnicity were both reported as unknown, not reported, or were both missing.</p>

<p>The level of protection gained after dose 1 was assessed in a post-hoc analysis in the mITT Set. In the interval 14 days after dose 1 to dose 2, there were 35 cases of COVID-19 on placebo and only 2 in the vaccine group. This indicates that the vaccine may provide some level of protection from 14 days after the first dose and before receiving dose 2. For optimal protection, two doses should be administered one month apart.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was assessed in individuals 18 years of age and older, including 3,768 subjects 65 years of age and older. The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna was consistent between older subjects (≥65 years) and younger subjects (18-64 years). Older subjects 65 years of age and over reported solicited local and systemic adverse reactions at a lower rate than younger subjects 18-64 years of age (see section 4.8).</p>
