<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Pharmaceutical form</h2>
<p>Dispersion for injection</p>

<p>White to off white dispersion (pH: 7.0 – 8.0).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Clinical particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>
<p>Spikevax is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<h5>Individuals 12 years of age and older</h5>

<p>Spikevax is administered as a course of 2 (two) 100 microgram doses (0.5mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 28 days after the first dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p>

<h5>Individuals 18 years of age and older</h5>

<p>A booster dose (0.25 mL, containing 50 micrograms mRNA, which is half of the primary dose) of Spikevax may be administered intramuscularly at least 6 months after the second dose in individuals 18 years of age and older. The decision when and for whom to implement a third dose of Spikevax should be made based on available vaccine effectiveness data, taking into account limited safety data (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).</p>

<p>The interchangeability of Spikevax with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the primary vaccination course or the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) has not been established. Individuals who have received one dose of Spikevax (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms) should receive a second dose of Spikevax (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms) to complete the primary vaccination course.</p>

<h5>Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older</h5>

<p>A third dose (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms) may be given at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals who are severely immunocompromised (see section 4.4)</p>

<h5>Paediatric population</h5>
<p>The safety and efficacy of Spikevax in children less than 12 years of age have not yet been established. No data are available.</p>

<h5>Elderly population</h5>
<p>No dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals ≥65 years of age.</p>

<h4>Method of administration</h4>
<p>The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</p>

<p>The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.</p>

<p>For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.</p>

<p>For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>
<p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<h4>Traceability</h4>
<p>In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.</p>

<h4>Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis</h4>
<p>Anaphylaxis has been reported in individuals who have received Spikevax. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. The second dose of the vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, generalised urticaria) to the first dose of Spikevax.</p>

<h4>Myocarditis and pericarditis</h4>
<p>There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Spikevax, often in younger men and shortly after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest.</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinated individuals should also seek immediate medical attention should they experience new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias.</p>

<h4>Anxiety-related reactions</h4>
<p>Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.</p>

<h4>Concurrent illness</h4>
<p>Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination.</p>

<h4>Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders</h4>
<p>As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.</p>

<h4>Immunocompromised individuals</h4>
<p>The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of Spikevax may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.</p>

<h4>Duration of protection</h4>
<p>The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Limitations of vaccine effectiveness</h4>
<p>Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, vaccination with Spikevax may not protect all vaccine recipients.</p>

<h4>Excipients with known effect</h4>
<p>Sodium</p>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say, essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>
<p>No interaction studies have been performed.</p>

<p>Concomitant administration of Spikevax with other vaccines has not been studied.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>
<p>There is limited experience with use of Spikevax in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). Administration of Spikevax in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.</p>

<h4>Breast-feeding</h4>
<p>It is unknown whether Spikevax is excreted in human milk.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>
<p>Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).</p>

<h4>4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines</h4>
<p>Spikevax has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p>

<p>However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Undesirable effects</h3>

<h4>Summary of the safety profile</h4>

<p>Participants 18 years of age and older:</p>

<p>The safety of Spikevax was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351 participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age and older.</p>

<p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions were pain at the injection site (92%), fatigue (70%), headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), injection site swelling (14.7%) and redness (10%). Adverse reactions were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.</p>

<p>Overall, there was a higher incidence of some adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to &lt; 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above.</p>

<p>Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.</p>

<p>If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti-pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol-containing products) may be used.</p>

<p>Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age:</p>

<p>Safety data for Spikevax in adolescents were collected in an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in the United States involving 3,726 participants 12 through 17 years of age who received at least one dose of Spikevax (n=2,486) or placebo (n=1,240) (NCT04649151). Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo.</p>

<p>The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age were injection site pain (97%), headache (78%), fatigue (75%), myalgia (54%), chills (49%), axillary swelling/tenderness (35%), arthralgia (35%), nausea/vomiting (29%), injection site swelling (28%), injection site erythema (26%), and fever (14%).</p>

<p>Participants 18 years of age and older (booster dose)</p>

<p>The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax vaccine primary series. In an open-label phase of this study, 167 of those participants received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose of the primary series. The solicited adverse reaction profile for the booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was similar to that after the second dose in the primary series.</p>

<h4>Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older</h4>

<p>The safety profile presented below is based on data generated in a placebo-controlled clinical study on 30,351 adults ≥ 18 years of age., another placebo-controlled clinical study with 3,726 participants 12 through 17 years of age, and post-marketing experience.</p>

<p>Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency convention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very common (≥1/10)</li>
  <li>Common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10)</li>
  <li>Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100)</li>
  <li>Rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000)</li>
  <li>Very rare (&lt;1/10,000)</li>
  <li>Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)</li>
</ul>

<p>Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.</p>

<h4>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h4>
<p>Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. If you are concerned about an adverse event, it should be reported on a Yellow Card. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting site</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card
in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.mhra.yellowcard" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Google Play</a> or Apple App Store and include the vaccine brand and batch/Lot number if available. Alternatively, adverse events of concern in
association with Spikevax can be reported to Moderna on the toll-free number: 08000857562 or via <a href="www.modernacovid19global.com" class="govuk-link">Moderna COVID19 Global</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not report the same adverse event(s) to both systems as all reports will be shared between Moderna and MHRA (in an anonymised form) and dual reporting will create unnecessary duplicates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>
<p>No case of overdose has been reported.</p>

<p>In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pharmacological properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>
<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>
<p>Spikevax contains mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.</p>

<p>The mRNA encodes for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. After intramuscular injection, cells at the injection site and the draining lymph nodes take up the lipid nanoparticle, effectively delivering the mRNA sequence into cells for translation into viral protein. The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is non-replicating, and is expressed transiently mainly by dendritic cells and subcapsular sinus macrophages. The expressed membrane-bound spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is then recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen. This elicits both T-cell and Bcell responses to generate neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.</p>

<h4>Clinical efficacy in adults</h4>
<p>The adult study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 3 clinical study (NCT04470427) that excluded individuals who were immunocompromised or had received immunosuppressants within 6 months, as well as participants who were pregnant, or with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with stable HIV disease were not excluded. Influenza vaccines could be administered 14 days before or 14 days after any dose of Spikevax. Participants were also required to observe a minimum interval of 3 months after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins prior to the study in order to receive either placebo or Spikevax.</p>

<p>A total of 30,351 subjects were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1-122) for the development of COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per Protocol Set or PPS), included 28,207 subjects who received either Spikevax (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status.</p>

<p>The PPS study population included 47.4% female, 52.6% male, 79.5% White, 9.7% African American, 4.6% Asian, and 6.2% other. 19.7% of participants identified as Hispanic or Latino. The median age of subjects was 53 years (range 18-94). A dosing window of –7 to +14 days for administration of the second dose (scheduled at day 29) was allowed for inclusion in the PPS. 98% of vaccine recipients received the second dose 25 days to 35 days after dose 1 (corresponding to -3 to +7 days around the interval of 28 days).</p>

<p>COVID-19 cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) and by a Clinical Adjudication Committee. Vaccine efficacy overall and by key age groups are presented in Table 2.</p>

<h1>COVID-19: symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the 2nd dose.</h1>

<p>*Vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model
** Confidence interval not adjusted for multiplicity. Multiplicity adjusted statistical analyses were carried out in an
interim analysis based on less COVID-19 cases, not reported here.</p>

<p>Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Among all subjects in the PPS, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the vaccine group compared with 30 of 185 (16%) cases reported in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Of the 30 participants with severe disease, 9 were hospitalised, 2 of which were admitted to an intensive care unit. The majority of the remaining severe cases fulfilled only the oxygen saturation (SpO2) criterion for severe disease (≤ 93% on room air).</p>

<p>The vaccine efficacy of Spikevax to prevent COVID-19, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (determined by baseline serology and nasopharyngeal swab sample testing) from 14 days after Dose 2 was 93.6% (95% confidence interval 88.5, 96.4%).</p>

<p>Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed similar efficacy point estimates across genders, ethnic groups, and participants with medical comorbidities associated with high risk of severe COVID-19.</p>

<p>The level of protection gained after dose 1 was assessed in a post-hoc analysis in the mITT Set. In the interval 14 days after dose 1 to dose 2, there were 35 cases of COVID-19 on placebo and only 2 in the vaccine group. This indicates that the vaccine may provide some level of protection from 14 days after the first dose and before receiving dose 2. For optimal protection, two doses should be administered one month apart.</p>

<p>Clinical efficacy in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age:</p>

<p>The adolescent study is an ongoing Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study (NCT04649151) to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and efficacy of Spikevax in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. Participants with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from the study. A total of 3,732 participants were randomised 2:1 to receive 2 doses of Spikevax or saline placebo 1 month apart.</p>

<p>A secondary efficacy analysis was performed in 3,181 participants who received 2 doses of either Spikevax (n=2,139) or placebo (n=1,042) and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status in the Per Protocol Set. Between participants who received Spikevax and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.</p>

<p>COVID-19 was defined as symptomatic COVID-19 requiring positive RT-PCR result and at least 2 systemic symptoms or 1 respiratory symptom. Cases starting 14 days after the second dose: there were zero symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the Spikevax group and 4 symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Immunogenicity in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age</p>

<p>A non-inferiority analysis evaluating SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising titers and seroresponse rates 28 days after Dose 2 was conducted in the Per-Protocol immunogenicity subsets of adolescents aged 12 through 17 (n=340) in the adolescent study and in participants aged 18 through 25 (n=296) in the adult study. Subjects had no immunologic or virologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the neutralising antibody titers in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age compared to the 18- to 25-year-olds was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.24). The difference in seroresponse rate was 0.2% (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4). Non inferiority criteria (lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR &gt; 0.67 and lower bound of the 95% of the seroresponse rate difference &gt; -10%) were met.</p>

<p>Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster dose (0.25mL, 50 micrograms)</p>

<p>The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Spikevax are evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-confirmation study in participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198 participants received two doses (0.5 mL, 100 micrograms 1 month apart) of the Spikevax vaccine as primary series. In an open-label phase, 149 of those participants (Per-Protocol Set) received a single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) at least 6 months after receiving the second dose in the primary series. A single booster dose (0.25 mL, 50 micrograms) was shown to result in a geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of 12.99 (95% CI: 11.04, 15.29) in neutralising antibodies from pre-booster compared to 28 days after the booster dose. The GMFR in neutralising antibodies was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32, 1.77) when compared 28 days post dose 2 (primary series) to 28 days after the booster dose.</p>

<h4>Elderly population</h4>
<p>Spikevax was assessed in individuals 12 years of age and older, including 3,768 subjects 65 years of age and older. The efficacy of Spikevax was consistent between elderly (≥65 years) and younger adult subjects (18-64 years).</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>
<p>The licensing authority has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with the Spikevax in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).</p>

<h4>Conditional Approval</h4>
<p>This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. New information on this medicinal product will be reviewed at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pharmacokinetic properties</h3>
<p>Not applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Preclinical safety data</h3>
<p>Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. The full relevance of animal studies to human risk with vaccines for COVID-19 remains to be established.</p>

<h4>General Toxicity:</h4>
<p>General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly receiving up to 4 doses exceeding the human dose once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to humans is low.</p>

<h4>Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity:</h4>
<p>In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted with the novel lipid component SM-102 of the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed.</p>

<h4>Reproductive Toxicity:</h4>
<p>In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of mRNA (100 micrograms) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Spikevax was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to mating, and on
gestation days 1 and 13. SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo foetal or offspring development or postnatal development. No data are available of mRNA-1273 vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk.</p>
