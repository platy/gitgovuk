<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>Up to £14 million will be made available through the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) Fund for activities enabling volunteering and tackling loneliness in 6 to 9 high deprivation local authorities. In line with the missions set out in the Levelling Up White Paper, our primary ambition is to develop our understanding of what works to improve wellbeing and pride in place in these communities through volunteering and community initiatives tackling loneliness. Citizens will be able to participate in local projects which build their skills, wellbeing and social networks.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>KYN Fund objectives</h2>

<p>The objectives of the KYN Fund are, by March 2025:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To build the evidence to identify scalable and sustainable place-based interventions that work in increasing regular volunteering and reducing chronic loneliness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To increase the proportion of people in targeted high-deprivation local authorities who volunteer at least once a month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To reduce the proportion of chronically lonely people in targeted high-deprivation local authorities who lack desired level of social connections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To enable targeted high-deprivation local authorities, and the local voluntary and community sector in these places, to implement sustainable systems and processes that encourage volunteering and tackling loneliness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Role of Intermediary Grant Maker (IGM)</h2>

<p>There are three core elements to this role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Designing and delivering a fair and open process for eligible Onward Grant Recipients (OGRs) to apply for funding from the voluntary and community social enterprise (VCSE) sector in the IGM’s selected 6 to 9 geographical areas, working in partnership with local people to help identify the relevant skills, activities and resources already existing in those areas to help strengthen and improve things locally. This will involve ensuring a balanced spread of funding is distributed to achieve the objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administering grants to OGRs to carry out projects in the targeted communities that increase volunteering and support people to connect with others in their local area, reducing loneliness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building the evidence to identify scalable and sustainable place-based interventions that work in increasing regular volunteering and reducing chronic loneliness. The IGM will need to play a significant role in ensuring the quality of the evaluation is high, by ensuring that all funded projects have an impact evaluation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The evaluation for this programme will be split in two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An overarching evaluation commercially tendered by DCMS -&nbsp; This will include qualitative research, synthesis of monitoring data and a value for money analysis. We also expect the evaluator to work with the IGM and OGRs to peer review and support experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation design and delivery.&nbsp; The overarching evaluation report published will include a synthesis of the process evaluation and individual programme evaluations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individual project evaluations commissioned by Onward Grant Recipients-&nbsp; The IGM will ensure impact evaluations are carried out for all funded projects and administer the funding for these evaluations.&nbsp; A budget of up to £1,080,000 (inclusive of VAT over the three year period) will be protected as a pot for the IGM to access for this purpose. It will be made available in monthly tranches by DCMS as and when we know what evaluation designs will be possible at a local level. The IGM will need to ensure that, at a minimum, theory-based impact evaluations are carried out at project level.&nbsp; They should set out plans to ensure that grantees are incentivised to conduct experimental or quasi-experimental evaluations. We will also look favourably on bids that demonstrate that the IGM is able to bring in relevant evaluation expertise to advise and support OGRs on project-level evaluations.&nbsp; We encourage partnerships with academics or other evaluators where this expertise does not exist in-house. Any of this pot not drawn down for evaluation will be reprofiled for programme spend.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Local projects in scope for onward grants</h2>

<p>Projects in targeted high-deprivation areas should aim to use volunteering to help improve the wellbeing, skills, confidence or social connections of volunteers, and/or to support people to develop social connections within their communities.</p>

<p>The IGM should assess the onward grant applicants on their ability to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide access to volunteering opportunities in targeted high-deprivation neighbourhoods;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve social connections within the community;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement sustainable systems and processes that encourage volunteering and tackling loneliness;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build the evidence to identify scalable and sustainable place-based interventions that work in increasing regular volunteering and reducing chronic loneliness; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Represent value for money, with interventions expected to achieve a high benefit-cost ratio to be prioritised.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate what mix of projects could be funded, if we successfully achieve our objectives in a high-deprivation local authority:</p>

<p>People living in high-deprivation neighbourhoods will access enriching projects. These projects should aim to help improve their wellbeing, skills, confidence, or social connections and enable access (or remove barriers) to these opportunities to volunteer and participate. Types of projects could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time limited projects or events (eg. festivals, parades, family fun days)</li>
  <li>Environmental and green activities (eg. community gardens or litter picking)</li>
  <li>Food provision or community cafes</li>
  <li>Activities for young people (eg. outings, training, clubs)</li>
  <li>Activities to support children and families (eg. play sessions, support for parents)</li>
  <li>Befriending, or mentoring initiatives (online or in person)</li>
  <li>Social and wellbeing activities (eg. lunch clubs for the elderly or online communities of support)</li>
  <li>Employment or skills sharing activities (eg. computer skills, cooking, sewing, knitting, arts and crafts)</li>
  <li>Information, advice and support services for vulnerable groups (eg. money, debt and benefits)</li>
  <li>Activities to support carers and disabled people</li>
  <li>Resident and neighbour engagement and consultation events to develop and improve areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Systems and partnerships will be stronger between local Voluntary and Community Social Enterprises (VCSEs), statutory partners and local citizens. We hope that through the programme, more systemic change will take place. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local people help identify relevant skills, activities and resources locally through an asset based community development (ABCD) approach. Recognising, identifying and harnessing existing ‘assets’ (i.e. things like skills, knowledge, capacity, resources, experience or enthusiasm) that individuals and communities have which can help to strengthen and improve things locally. Instead of looking at what a community needs or lacks, the approach focuses on utilising the ‘assets’ that are already there. Areas might choose to fund consultation activities or recruit and train community organisers to achieve this, particularly if there is little existing VCSE infrastructure locally.</li>
  <li>There are stronger links between voluntary and community organisations and the health system to enable social prescribing by ensuring that social prescribing link workers have information about the local services and activities available, and are able to identify gaps in provision and work with VCS organisations to address these.</li>
  <li>The VCSE sector and statutory partners are better able to strategically convene around emerging challenges locally and address barriers to social connection at a systems level. This might be by sharing information about local barriers to connection and taking joined-up approaches to identifying and supporting people at risk of loneliness (eg. applying emerging learning from the Department for Transport’s Tackling Loneliness with Transport pilots to support people to connect in their area).</li>
  <li>Existing local physical assets are better utilised for community use. This might be through stronger strategic partnerships with schools, the high street, arts, heritage or sports centres, opening up their spaces for wider community use.</li>
  <li>Hyperlocal community initiatives have better access to local infrastructure and funding support. This might include better access to funding in the long term or support writing funding applications. For example, a local, regional or even national VCSE organisation builds relationships with a new set of community initiatives and provides ongoing support for groups to sustain volunteering opportunities and community engagement activities in high-deprivation neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Or businesses are more engaged and forge longer term funding commitments at a local level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Activities in scope of KYN Fund</h2>

<p>The following activities can be funded where they are essential for delivering relevant services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Staff salaries</li>
  <li>Project running costs</li>
  <li>Organisational running costs/overheads</li>
  <li>Goods and equipment which would not be capitalised (e.g. to develop enhanced physical environment and continue to deliver services)</li>
  <li>Organisational development</li>
</ul>

<p>The following cannot be funded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Activities that make profits for private gain</li>
  <li>Campaigning activities</li>
  <li>Religious activities (we can fund religious organisations if their project benefits the wider community and doesn’t include religious content)</li>
  <li>Political or lobbying activities</li>
  <li>Loan repayments</li>
  <li>Debt repayments to HMRC or other crown debts</li>
  <li>Capital costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Eligible geographical areas for funding</h2>

<p>KYN Fund will take a place-based approach, targeting support to areas with higher levels of deprivation or community need. Local authority districts eligible for KYN Fund support are provided below.</p>

<p>This shortlist of 27 local authorities has been selected by combining two measures of local need - the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) and the Community Needs Index (CNI) - and ensuring an even distribution between different area types (large urban areas, medium urban areas, rural or small urban areas).</p>

<p>The IGM will select 6 to 9 local authorities to work with from this shortlist, including at least two local authorities from each area type. If a bidder wants to work in more than 6 areas they should demonstrate how they will ensure depth of impact and maintain a good mix of support for urban and rural communities in any additional areas they select.</p>

<p>Further information on the metrics used for place selection and the underlying methodology is provided in Annex A.</p>

This will include working with DCMS analytical teams and our contracted evaluator to ensure local areas are supported to develop and deliver high quality impact evaluations (using Randomised Control Trials or quasi-experimental methods where possible). <br> <br> Further specific requirements: <br> <br>  • Publication of 360giving compliant grant data. <br>  • Regular reporting of financial/expenditure data, using specified formats; <br>  • Coordination of Data Sharing Agreements, committing the grantee (and any sub-grantees) to sharing the anonymised beneficiary-level records required for us to assess impact at fund level; <br>  • A commitment to coordinating input from grantees and any sub-grantees into the fund-level evaluation. This will include the appointment of an evaluation Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to support, for example, the sampling and recruitment of qualitative research participants among grantees (our external evaluator will do the majority of the work, the burden would be minimal on individual projects). <br> <br> 2.6 We will form an advisory board that will oversee the whole Fund. Successful applicants must be willing to attend and contribute to the advisory board, and further invite any consortium/ partnership delivery partners as needed as attendees. <br> <br> The advisory board will provisionally be made up of Deputy Directors from DCMS, delivery partners and the independent evaluators (both those commissioned by DCMS and any commissioned or at an individual project level). The advisory board will meet quarterly (or as needed) to review progress against shared objectives, share learnings arising from the programme and coordinate publicity and communication activity. Formal Terms of Reference for the advisory board will be drawn out after grant agreements have been completed. <br> <br> 2.7 Successful applicants will be required to: <br> <br>  Design the grant application process with DCMS <br> While DCMS will not be a decision-maker on which onward grantees receive grants, we expect to be consulted and provide approval for the design of the onward grant competition process. We will also want to attend decision-making panel discussions as an observer. <br> <br> Carry out post event assurance (PEA) <br> DCMS expects successful applicants to formulate a PEA plan that is fit for purpose. PEA should outline plans to quantify the level of fraud and error, and outline steps to clawback relevant grants identified in those areas. This should include due diligence on the onward grantees; privacy notices on data usage; fraud and clawback clauses in grant agreements. <br> <br> Provide on-going monitoring data <br> Successful applicants will be expected to provide monthly (switching to quarterly post March 2025 if the Fund is extended through cash match funding) monitoring data providing detail on the grants being made, including for each onward grant: <br> <br>  • Value committed <br>  • Value disbursed <br>  • Geography served by grantee <br>  • Type of service provided by grantee <br>  • Particular beneficiary groups served by grantee (including number of beneficiaries supported, activities they have participated in and basic demographic data) <br>  • Where appropriate, number of volunteering opportunities created, the frequency of those opportunities (specifically, whether  volunteering takes place at least monthly) and the duration of opportunities (i.e. volunteer retention data) <br>  • Where appropriate, number of chronically lonely individuals reached <br> <br> In addition, those awarded sub-grants will be expected to survey participants to assess each participant/beneficiary’s wellbeing and  loneliness prior to their engagement in an intervention, three months after the start of their engagement (or at the end of the engagement for shorter interventions) and on at least one further occasion (likely nine months post-initial engagement to enable assessment of the durability of wellbeing changes).  We envisage that a standardised survey(s) would be created by the IGM for this purpose, with the potential to adjust the content where required for specific projects. The standard pre-engagement participant survey could also be used to gather relevant demographic data. <br> <br> Data requirements may be refined once grant agreements have been finalised. <br> <br> All successful applicants must work with the DCMS independent learning and evaluation partner to support design of the evaluation and collection of relevant data for the overarching process and impact evaluation (if possible following feasibility study) to be delivered across the whole KYN Fund. <br> <br> Attend monitoring meetings <br> All successful applicants will be expected to report as follows: <br> <br>  • Through attendance at monthly monitoring meetings to report on progress of grant awards (based on the monitoring returns outlined above) and update on risks /slippage on spend. DCMS will also hold quarterly internal project and performance meetings which the Intermediary Grant Maker may be asked to report to. <br>  • Quarterly updates on progress of matched funded element from 1 April 2025 if applicable <br> <br> 2.8 Ensure you are able to spend the grant in line with DCMS grant terms and conditions and have adequate safeguarding policies in place.  The DCMS draft terms and conditions for grant agreements are available on the gov.uk website. <br> <br> 2.9 Please see 1.13 above for guidance regarding partnership bids.</td>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Annex A: Target area selection methodology</h2>

<p>This annex provides further details on the methodology and selected metrics used to develop the shortlist of local authority areas provided below.</p>

<p>The approach to place selection is based on the objectives of the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) Fund which aims to target interventions in high-deprivation areas.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this fund, deprivation or place-based need is defined with reference to two broad dimensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>People and local economy factors (e.g., household incomes, local labour markets, economic and mutli-dimentsional deprivation); and</li>
  <li>Strength of civil society and community factors (e.g., depth and breadth of local VCSE activity and funding, level of volunteering and community participation).</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>Metrics</h3>

<p>To identify high-need areas based on people and local economy factors we have used the 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019">English Index of Multiple Deprivation</a> (IMD), published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (now the Department for Levelling Up, Housing &amp; Communities, DLUHC).</p>

<p>To identify high-need areas based on strength of civil society and community factors we have used <a class="govuk-link" href="https://localtrust.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/local_trust_ocsi_left_behind_research_august_2019.pdf" rel="external">the Community Needs Index</a> (CNI), published by Local Trust and Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion (OCSI). The CNI is based on 19 indicators split across three categories - “An Engaged Community”, “Civic Assets” and “Connectedness”. For more information on the indicators that are included in the CNI please see Local Trust and OCSI’s 2019 report.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>We have chosen to combine these two indices for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combining the IMD and CNI provides a good coverage of indicators relevant to the objectives of KYN fund, and our associated definition of deprivation/place-based need.</li>
  <li>Both indices have a good degree of geographical granularity.</li>
  <li>Our approach combines national statistics on deprivation, with a well-known measure developed outside of government which was used in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom">Levelling Up White Paper.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Methodology</h3>

<p>KYN Fund will be targeted at the level of local authority districts (LADs), although we expect the IGM and delivery organisations to further target high-need areas or communities within LADs.</p>

<p>The following methodology was used to extract and convert the data sources, and combine them into a single metric for assessing place-based need at the local authority level. Our selection metric is also stratified to ensure a balance of area types, further detail of which is provided below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>IMD data is taken from the “local authority district summaries” data file (File 10) of the English indices of deprivation (IoD2019) produced by MHCLG in 2019. The “Rank of average rank” summary measure was used for our combined metric to ensure standardisation between IMD and CNI. Further information on the average rank summary measure is provided in the IoD2019 statistical release.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>CNI data was provided to DCMS by OCSI, analysis of which has previously been published by Local Trust and OCSI in 2019<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> and 2020<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. CNI data is provided at a ward level, so a “CNI average rank” metric was calculated using the same approach as the IMD (using wards instead of Lower Layer Super Output Areas). This involved calculating a population-weighted mean rank of all the wards within each local authority (further information on the IMD “average rank” methodology is provided in the IoD2019 technical report on p.114<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>).</li>
  <li>A combined metric was produced by summing the average ranks of the IMD and CNI for each LAD, such that: KYN Fund selection metric = IMD (rank of) average rank + CNI (rank of) average rank</li>
  <li>To ensure a balanced distribution<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> between area types the nine highest-need local authorities were selected from the following three area categories using the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) Rural-Urban Classification of LADs<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>:
    <ul>
      <li>Large urban areas: combines ONS’ “Urban with Major Conurbation” and “Urban with Minor Conurbation” categories</li>
      <li>Medium urban area: ONS’ “Urban with City and Town” category</li>
      <li>Rural and small urban areas: combines ONS’ “Mainly rural”, “Largely rural” and “Urban with Significant Rural”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The shortlist of 27 target areas is provided below.</p>
