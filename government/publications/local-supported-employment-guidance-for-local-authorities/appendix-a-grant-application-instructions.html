<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General information</h2>

<p>These instructions, together with the Local Supported Employment (<abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>) Initiative Local Authority Guidance document (“Guidance”) and all other information and documents to which they refer, are designed to ensure that each completed Grant Application Template: Local Supported Employment (“<abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application”) is given equal and fair consideration. It is important, therefore, that you provide all the information asked for in the format and order specified.</p>

<p>This document contains the information and instructions local authorities (<abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>) need to submit a completed <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> grant application.</p>

<p>Please read the information and instructions carefully as non-compliance with the instructions may result in the disqualification of your Grant Application from this exercise. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> need to ensure that they have read all the documentation contained within this pack thoroughly so that questions or clarifications are not raised unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Terms defined in the Guidance and/or the Grant Funding Conditions for Local Supported Employment (set out in Appendix A to the Guidance) shall have the same meaning in these instructions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Administration of the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application</h2>

<p>The Local Supported Employment (<abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>) Initiative Grant Application process opens on 14 April 2022 and you have until 5pm 26 May 2022 to email your Grant Application to the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Applications received will then be sifted in accordance with the Selection Criteria set out below initially before being passed through to the panel for checking against the Selection Criteria, assessment, scoring, allocation of additional points (if applicable) and ranking on the basis of specific characteristics. Once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has decided to which Grant Applicants <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> team will then write to <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> contacts (using the contact details provided) to inform them of the result and issue completed Grant Funding Agreements to successful <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Costs and expenses</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not reimburse any travel and subsistence expenses incurred by <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in connection with any <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Question clarification</h2>

<p>A question-and-answer log will be held by the programme following the launch to manage and monitor all questions raised to provide a consistent response to enquiries. The question-and-answer log will be published on a weekly basis. Questions must be submitted by Friday 13 May 2022, after which a final version of the log will be circulated.</p>

<p>It will be distributed to all <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who subscribe to the log. Therefore, please indicate if you would like to subscribe to the log by sending an email to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the subject heading ‘Question and Answer Log Subscription’. All questions will be anonymised.</p>

<p>Subject always to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s obligations under <abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr>, <abbr title="Environmental Information Regulations">EIR</abbr> and any other applicable legislation, should there be anything in your clarification question in which you feel is sensitive to your <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, please identify this when raising the question and we will consider whether it should be omitted from the published log. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider the sensitivity of the clarification question and if it considers the clarification question is sensitive it will give the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> the opportunity to either retract the clarification question without receiving an answer or confirm that the clarification question is not sensitive (in which case the response will be circulated to all subscribing <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>). If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> considers a clarification question to be sensitive and that providing a response only to the relevant <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> would not favour or dis-favour any <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> nor distort competition, then it may respond only to that <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Acceptance and return of grant applications</h2>

<p>Completed Grant Application Templates and Profiles Templates once submitted, will remain unopened until the deadline for receipt has passed and then they will be opened, checked against the Selection Criteria, assessed, scored, allocated additional points (if applicable) and ranked on the basis of specific characteristics in accordance with the procedures detailed in this Appendix A.  Grant Applications will undergo an initial compliance check to ensure that all information requested has been received. In the event that a Grant Application received from an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> does not contain all of the required information, that Grant Application will be rejected and will no longer be considered for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Data security</h2>

<p>Please be aware of sensitive information that you may wish to include in your Grant Application. Use anonymised information if you are referring to a specific example, please do not include any personal data. Do note, the Local Supported Employment Initiative is subject to standard <abbr title="Freedom of Information Act">FOIA</abbr> requests.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Grant Application Timetable</h2>

<p>Set out below is the proposed “Grant Application Timetable”. This is intended as a guide and, whilst <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not intend to deviate significantly from it, there may be occasions (for example around obtaining Ministerial approval) where the Grant Application Timetable will be subject to change.</p>

<h3>Grant Application Template</h3>

<p>In this section You/Your refers to the Grant Applicant.</p>

<p>You should answer all questions using the templates provided, presenting them in the same sequence and using the same references. Please ensure all answers are self-contained with no cross-referencing. Only information entered into the appropriate answer boxes (which may be extended as necessary but should not exceed any applicable maximum word count) will be taken into consideration for the purposes of evaluating the grant application.</p>

<p>Responses must not exceed the pre-set margins and space allocation. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has applied a maximum word count on your response to some or all questions. These limits are provided in the Grant Application Template and any response in excess of these allocations will be disregarded and will not be evaluated.</p>

<p>Bullets, tables, simple graphs and charts in support of your responses are all permitted. Responses must be presented using Arial font size 12 (English/Welsh language and black typeface) this includes instances where information may be tabulated as part of the response. The only exception permitted is for illustrative screen shots, graphs and charts (if these have been specifically requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>), which should be presented within the allocated word limit for the question they are relevant to and must not be embedded separately as this information will be disregarded.</p>

<p>Grant Application Templates must be completed using Microsoft Word. Files submitted in Microsoft Project, Excel format or PDF will not be accepted.</p>

<p>All acronyms and abbreviations, if used, must be fully explained.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> must complete the Grant Application Template in full. Any additional supporting documents submitted will not be assessed.</p>

<h3>Grant Application Template Completion On Behalf Of A Cluster</h3>

<p>Where a Grant Application is being made on behalf of a Cluster of <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>, all <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> within the Cluster should be listed in the ‘Name and address’ field of the Grant Application Template, with the name and address of the lead <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> first.
<abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are asked if they currently operate a Supported Employment provision. Supported Employment is a model for assisting disabled people to secure and retain meaningful work at the appropriate rate of pay, defined as at least the minimum hourly rate for the Participant’s age group (relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rates</a>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Clusters should be defined by the characteristics of the majority of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in the Cluster, for example, more than 3 of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in a Cluster of 6 must be providing Supported Employment for a Cluster to be defined as providing Supported Employment.</p>

<p>In the event there is an even split of this characteristic in a Cluster, the Cluster will be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing a Supported Employment service</li>
</ul>

<p>When proposing how many Participants they will start on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Provision <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should consider attrition rates prior to starting provision to take into account potential Participants who may be found to be ineligible or decide not to sign up to provision. Starting on provision is defined as the first meeting with a Participant following confirmation of eligibility, where they sign up to the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Initiative. The range is set at 60-140 Participants per <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> (or Cluster, where relevant), with expectation that most <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> (or Clusters) will propose approximately 100 Participants starting on provision.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to offer funding for fewer Participants than an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> proposes in order to reconcile supply and demand of funding.  If the average of the total number of Participants proposed by the top 20 Grant Applicants (after any replacements are made as set out in section 14 below) is higher than <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s suggested number of Participants (100), <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may need to reduce profiles proportionately across Grant Applications.   If the average of the total number of Participants proposed by the top 20 Grant Applicants (after any replacements are made as set out in section 14 below) is below <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s suggested number of Participants (100) per <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may increase the number of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants it awards to ensure the maximum number of Participants on the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Initiative can be achieved. These additional Grants are referred to in these Application Instructions as “Additional Grants”.</p>

<p>Funding is capped in line with the number of Participants the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> proposes in the Grant Application Template as agreed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and specified in the Grant Funding Letter. For example, if an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> proposes 100 Participants then 100 multiplied by £3,500 would mean the maximum <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Funding that such <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> could receive would be £350,000.</p>

<p>All parts of question 1 of the Grant Application Template must be answered.  If they are not then the Grant Application will become a Rejected Grant Application and will no longer be considered for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant funding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.1 – The Supported Employment 5 Stage Supported Employment Model can be seen in the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.2.1 – This question allows you to provide additional information alongside the expenditure profile which must be provided in the Profile Template. This should include all costs and spend the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> expects to incur in <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> delivery. This total should be equal to or greater than the amount <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> funding of £3,500 per Participant starting on provision plus the minimum Grant Recipient Match Funding of £1,500 per Participant. For example, if you apply for 100 starts on provision, the total expenditure should total at least (£,3500+£1,500) x 100 = £500,000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.2.2 – Yes/No answer required for commitment to expenditure throughout initiative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.3 – Yes/No answer required for commitment to providing Grant Recipient Match Funding throughout Initiative. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> must ensure that Grant Recipient Match Funding is used solely for the purpose of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> delivery and there will be no double funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.4 – Explanation of expenditure relating to implementation period and set up of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Question 1.5 – <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should all be working to achieve <a class="govuk-link" href="https://disabilityconfident.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">Disability Confident</a> Leader (Level 3) DC Leader Level 3 and we strongly recommend that your employer network join the Disability Confident scheme and progress through the journey</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Section 2 will provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the design and geography of your <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> for consideration in evaluation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Clusters should be defined by the characteristics of the majority of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in the Cluster, for example, more than 3 of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in a Cluster of 6 must be rural for a Cluster to be defined as rural.</p>

<p>In the event there is an even split of this characteristic in a Cluster, the Cluster will be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rural</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 3 will provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with an understanding of the Fidelity requirements of your <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> or appointed Activity Delivery Partner. If successful, the Grant Recipient or their approved Activity Delivery Partner will be asked to provide evidence of the model Fidelity Kitemark or equivalent, if applicable.</p>

<p>Section 4, sub-sections A to D are questions to which the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> must respond and the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>’s responses will be scored as per the scoring methodology in Section 14 of this document.</p>

<h3>Profile template</h3>

<p>The Profile Template that accompanies the Grant Application Template must be completed using Microsoft Excel. Files submitted in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Project or PDF will not be accepted.</p>

<p>All acronyms and abbreviations, if used, must be fully explained.</p>

<h2>

<p>The Grant Application Template and Profile Template must not, under any circumstance, be altered.
Your Grant Application may be completed and submitted at any time on or before the Grant Application Deadline using the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> email address set out in paragraph 2.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your Grant Application Template and Profile Template has been fully completed and all information included prior to the Grant Application Deadline.</p>

<p>Please allow sufficient time to submit your Grant Application, it is recommended that you allow time for a final check to be undertaken prior to the Grant Application Deadline. It will not be possible for you to submit any further information after the Grant Application Deadline. Information Technology (IT) problems within your own system will not be considered reasonable grounds for late submission of your Grant Application.</p>

<p>Grant Applications cannot be modified after the Grant Application Deadline. At the Grant Application Deadline, you must ensure that you have only submitted the Grant Application Template and the Profile Template – no other documents will be accepted.</p>

<p>Should <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> need to extend the Grant Application Deadline you will be notified in writing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Deadline for Submission of grant application</h2>

<p>All Grant Applications must be received by the Grant Application Deadline shown in the Grant Application Timetable.</p>

<p>To ensure that all <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are treated fairly, Grant Applications received after the Grant Application Deadline will be rejected by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and will no longer be considered for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Additional materials, documents and attachments</h2>

<p>No additional documentation should be submitted with the Grant Application Template and Profile Template. Information that forms part of general company literature or promotional brochures will not form part of the evaluation process and should not be submitted.</p>

<p>The Grant Application Template and Profile Template should not contain any inserted, pasted or embedded pictures or documents (image files, Adobe Acrobat documents or other word documents) unless specifically requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Grant Application Assessment Process</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will undertake an initial selection appraisal of each <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application to satisfy itself that the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application has met the Selection Criteria set out below as set out in section 1 of Appendix B: Grant Application Template (“Selection Criteria”).</p>

<p>Only those <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Applications which meet the Selection Criteria will go forward to then be subject to assessment by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> against the Assessment Criteria set out below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Selection Criteria</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would like to work with <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> from across a range of categories. Both <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who are already delivering a Supported Employment service and those who are not currently delivering a Supported Employment service may make an <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application. For its <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application to be selected the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>located in England or Wales</li>
  <li>in predominantly rural or predominantly urban conurbations</li>
  <li>operating as County Council or Unitary Authority (including Metropolitan Councils and London Boroughs)</li>
</ul>

<p>To be considered for selection an <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application must meet the Selection Criteria.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> has met these Selection Criteria then the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application will not go forward for assessment against the Assessment Criteria, will no longer be considered for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant funding and will be rejected from this process. A Grant Application that is rejected is a “Rejected Grant Application”.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Assessment Criteria</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Scoring Methodology and Evaluation Methodology</h2>

<h3>Scoring Methodology</h3>

<p>Each <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application will be scored on its responses to the eight scored questions within the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application against the Assessment Criteria stipulated above. Please note that any questions scored zero will result in the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application being rejected, and no longer being considered for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant funding.
There are eight scored questions within the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application. All are weighted equally.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Methodology</h3>

<p>The evaluation method for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Applications that have not become Rejected Grant Applications will be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each such <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application will be evaluated and given a “Responses To Questions Score” which will be the sum of scores for the responses to each of the eight scored questions in that <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculation of additional points</h3>

<p>Once final Responses to Questions Scores have been calculated for each Grant Application, the Grant Application evaluation panel will hold a meeting to separate out Grant Applications made by <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> located in Wales from Grant Applications made by <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> located in England.</p>

<p>The Grant Application evaluation panel will then calculate the additional points for each Grant Application.  Additional points are calculated in accordance with different measures depending if the Grant Application has been made by a <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> located in England or Wales, as set out below.</p>

<h3>Grant Applications from English <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Grant Applications from English <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> which have not become Rejected Grant Applications will be awarded additional points based on the following measure/priority list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Adult Social Care Outcome Framework (<abbr title="Adult Social Care Outcome Framework">ASCOF</abbr>) measure 1e, will be split into quartiles. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> that score in the lowest quartile will receive an additional 6 points, 2nd quartile 4 points, 3rd quartile 2 points, above this <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will receive no additional points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will look to see if any English <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application are one of the places identified in the 100 priority places, for the purposes of allocation of the UK Community Renewal Fund.  This list of 100 priority places also informs the design of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will give English <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application and who are on this 100 priority places list an additional 6 points.  English <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application but who are not on this 100 places priority list will receive no additional points</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Grant Applications from Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Grant Applications from Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> which have not become Rejected Grant Applications will be awarded additional points based on the following rate/priority list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will look at the disability employment rate for Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application. The Welsh disability employment rate will be split into quartiles. Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> that sit in the lowest quartile will receive an additional 6 points, 2nd quartile 4 points, 3rd quartile 2 points, above this Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will receive no additional points</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will look to see if any Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application are one of the places identified in the 100 priority places, for the purposes of allocation of the UK Community Renewal Fund.  This list of 100 priority places also informs the design of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will give Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application and who are on in this 100 priority places list an additional 6 points.  Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who have made a Grant Application but who are not on this 100 places priority list will receive no additional points</li>
</ul>

<h3>Total Score</h3>

<p>The “Total Score” for each Grant Application which has not become a Rejected Grant Application will be the sum of the additional points added to the Responses To Questions Score for that Grant Application.</p>

<h3>Ranking and selection of Grant Applications</h3>
<p>The Grant Applications will then be ranked in order by Total Score and the 20 Grant Applications with the highest Total Scores (“Top 20 By Score”) will be selected to receive Grants, provided that:</p>

<p>a) a maximum of 2 Grants will be awarded to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in Wales; and</p>

<p>b) the ranking characteristics detailed below (“Ranking Characteristics”) must be satisfied by the recipients of the Grants. If the requirements of any Ranking Characteristic(s) are not fulfilled by the Top 20 By Score then <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may, in accordance with the order of importance of the Ranking Characteristics, replace the lowest scoring Grant Application(s) of the Top 20 By Score which are not required in order to satisfy a Ranking Characteristic (taking into account the Ranking Characteristics of higher scoring Grant Applications) with the highest scoring Grant Applications which are required to satisfy the Ranking Characteristics (but which are not within the Top 20 By Score). E.g., if the Top 20 By Score did not contain the minimum number of rural <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in accordance with Ranking Characteristic (b), <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would replace the lowest scoring urban <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> in the top 20 with the highest scoring rural <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> that was not in the Top 20 By Score</p>

<p>Having ranked all Grant Applications in accordance with the Ranking Characteristics and (if necessary) applying the tie breaker methodology referred to in section 16 below, the Grant Application evaluation panel will agree on a final selection of 20 <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> to whom <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may then consider the average number of Participants covered by such 20 Grant Applications and determine whether or not it wishes to award Additional Grants, as set out in section 8 above (applying the tie breaker methodology if necessary).</p>

<p>The Ranking Characteristics are as follows:</p>

<p>(a) whether the Grant Applicant is located in England or Wales.</p>

<p>A maximum of 2 <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded to Welsh <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr></p>

<p>(b) whether the Grant Applicant is rural or urban (see Appendix B: Grant Application Template)</p>

<p>At least 3 of the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded to rural Grant Applicants. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will provide this information at section 2.3 of the Grant Application Template.</p>

<p>(c) whether the Grant Applicant is currently providing a supported employment service or not</p>

<p>At least 3 of the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who currently have a supported employment service.</p>

<p>(d) whether the Grant Applicant is located in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat" rel="external">North West, North East, West Midlands or East Midlands for England</a></p>

<p>At least 3 <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant will be awarded to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> located in the North of England, North = NW, NE, WM, EM, Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

<p>(e) whether the Grant Applicant is located in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat" rel="external">London or the South West, South East, or East of England</a></p>

<p>At least 3 <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grants will be awarded to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> located in the South of England, South = SW, SE, London, Eastern
Ranking Characteristics are listed above in order of importance (a) to (e) and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will apply them in this order.</p>

<h3>Assessing <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Clusters</h3>

<p><abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Clusters should be defined by the Ranking Characteristics of the majority of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in the Cluster, e.g., more than 3 of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in a Cluster of 6 must be rural for a Cluster to be defined as rural.</p>

<p>In the event there is an even split of Ranking Characteristic (b) amongst the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in a Cluster, the Cluster will be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rural</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> Clusters should be defined by the characteristics of the majority of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in the Cluster e.g., more than 3 of the <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in a Cluster of 6 must be providing a supported employment service for a Cluster to be defined as providing Supported Employment.</p>

<p>In the event there is an even split of Ranking Characteristic (c) in a Cluster, the Cluster will be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing a supported employment service</li>
</ul>

<p>A mean average of each Cluster Member’s additional points in respect of the <abbr title="Adult Social Care Outcome Framework">ASCOF</abbr> measure, or disability employment rate and appearance in the 100 priority places list will be calculated to give the additional points (if any) for each Cluster.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Tie breaker</h2>

<p>A tie breaker will be carried out as set out below in the event that it is necessary to differentiate between two or more Grant Applications which achieve the same Total Score so that the total number of Grants intended to be awarded will not be exceeded.</p>

<p>Where a tie breaker is required, it will be applied to the scores of all relevant Grant Applications with equal Total Scores. Note that the use of one tie breaker may not be sufficient to clearly identify all successful Grant Applications and so, in the event that the first tie breaker does not produce a result which differentiates the Grant Applications which have the same Total Score, a second tie breaker will be used.</p>

<p>The application of the tie-breaker will be as follows. If at any step this produces a clear result which differentiates the Grant Applications which have the same Total Score the process will be terminated and the Grant Application with the highest score will be deemed to be successful.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>10% of the score for question 4.5.1, will be added to the Total Score.</p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>10% of the score for question 4.2, will be added to the score from Step 1.</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<p>10% of the score for question 4.3, will be added to the score from Step 2.</p>
