<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1. The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) is providing grant funding for approximately 20 County Councils and Unitary Authorities (including Metropolitan Councils and London Boroughs) in England and Wales, to take part in the Local Supported Employment (<abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>) Initiative. The Initiative is aimed at helping adults with learning disabilities, autism or both to move into competitive employment providing the support they need to maintain that employment (“Supported Employment”).</p>

<p>2. This Initiative will help the growth of <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>-led Supported Employment. Through co-funding and providing the framework for <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to enable the delivery of high-quality Supported Employment which adheres to the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model. The longer-term ambition of this Initiative is to provide further evidence to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> of the value of Supported Employment and to help build sustained <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> investment in Supported Employment to secure effective employment for people with learning disabilities, autism or both.</p>

<p>3. Evidence from the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> <abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr> showed positive impacts on an individual’s self-esteem, job satisfaction, Quality Adjusted Life Years (<abbr title="Quality Adjusted Life Years">QALY</abbr>) and social contacts. Further evaluation from this Initiative will include a Participant survey and economic evaluation and aims for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to capture those benefits using <abbr title="Quality Adjusted Life Years">QALY</abbr> measurement. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> need to deliver all stages of the 5 Stage Supported Employment model.</p>

<p>4. The Grant will be paid under the Employment and Training Act 1973. All <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> in England and Wales were invited to submit a Grant Application. The criteria by which <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will be chosen as Grant Recipients can be found in Appendix A: Grant Application Instructions. It is a condition of the Grant Funding Agreement that match funding must be provided by Grant Recipients. For every Participant the Grant Recipient is required to provide Grant Recipient Match Funding to the value of at least £1,500. Further details can be found in Section 5 of this Guidance (Grant funding).</p>

<p>5. This Guidance sets out the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>background, including <abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr> Grant details</li>
  <li>Payment Model</li>
  <li>Grant Application process and requirements</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reporting requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>6. This document should be read in conjunction with the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grant Application launch letter, issued on 14 April 2022</li>
  <li>Grant Application and Profile templates</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reporting template</li>
</ul>

<p>7. This guidance document is subject to change.  Updated documents will be circulated following any update.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Background</h2>

<p>8. The government made a public commitment to delivering <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform-white-paper/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform">Adult Social Care Reform White Paper</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/shaping-future-support-the-health-and-disability-green-paper/shaping-future-support-the-health-and-disability-green-paper">Work, Health and Disability Green Paper (England)</a> to ensure that everyone should get the support they need whatever their disability or health condition.</p>

<p>9. Disabled people with autism (21.7%) and severe or specific learning disabilities (26.5%) had the lowest employment rates (January to June 2020) across all the main impairment types. This is significantly lower than the employment rate for the disabled population as a whole in the same period (53.6%). The employment rate for those with learning disabilities known to social care services has always been very low and has been between 5% and 6% in recent years.</p>

<p>10. There is strong international evidence that Supported Employment is effective for this group. In this context, Supported Employment is about achieving a mainstream job outcome at the Going Rate Of Pay with necessary support provided for the individual and employer in order to sustain the job.</p>

<h3>The 5 Stage Supported Employment model</h3>

<p>11. Supported Employment has been successfully used for decades as a model for supporting people with significant disabilities to secure and retain paid employment. Supported Employment does not adhere to a work readiness model, rather a Place, Train and Maintain approach is implemented.</p>

<p>12. Grant Recipients must adhere to the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model which is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a">Annex A</a>.</p>

<h3><abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr></h3>

<p>13. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, along with <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>, ran the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> <abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr>, from November 2017 for 18 months. The last day on provision was 31 May 2019: with the last date for referrals being 31 January 2019. The <abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr> aimed to increase the number of Supported Employment places delivered in partnership with 9 <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> through match funding from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The <abbr title="Proof of concept">PoC</abbr> aimed to complement existing provision to test whether delivering Supported Employment to a specified model drives better results and to identify a viable and effective way of delivering Supported Employment in partnership with <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>14. Following a consultation process with the 9 participating <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr>, a lessons learned exercise was completed and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has applied the lessons learned and feedback from <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> to incorporate changes into the design of this Initiative.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>15.	Initiative funding will be provided to <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who are successful in the Grant Application process for the purpose of supporting a new cohort of 60-140 individuals per <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> into employment in accordance with the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model set out at Annex A.</p>

<p>16.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is aiming to deliver Supported Employment for approximately 2,000 Participants in approximately 20 <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> areas. Evidence from other Supported Employment programmes suggests that at least 30% of Participants should start some form of work, in other words, at least 600 Participants starting some form of work through the Initiative.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Grant details</h2>

<p>17. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who wish to become Grant Recipients of a Grant will be required to recruit Participants to <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>, submit an application for a Grant and provide Supported Employment to a range of between 60 to 140 Participants across the Funding Period of the Initiative (November 2022 to March 2025). When determining the number of Participants <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are committing to support on the Initiative, <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should ensure they provide a clear rationale within their application to validate the number of Participants they are committing to support on the Initiative. This may include reflecting location (rural or urban), customer demographics and any other relevant internal or external factors, which might impact the number of Participants that the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> can successfully recruit and support.</p>

<p>18. Grant Recipients must enter into a Grant Funding Agreement with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The Grant Funding Agreement must be signed for and on behalf of the Grant Recipient (as set out in the Grant Funding Letter) and returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Funded Activities</h3>

<p>19. Grant Recipients will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver the implementation activities outlined in the Grant Application, such as development of supporting processes and procedures, recruitment, training and marketing</li>

</ul>

<p>20.	Grant Recipients must deliver all stages of the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model as set out in Annex A of this Guidance. Grant Recipients must also ensure their delivery is assessed against the <abbr title="Supported Employment Quality Framework">SEQF</abbr>. Further information can be found at Section 10 of this Guidance (Fidelity Assessment).</p>

<p>21.	Grant Recipients will recognise and adopt good practice and tailor the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> they provide to each Participant’s individual needs.</p>

<p>22.	Grant Recipients may outsource elements of their <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> provision to one or more Activity Delivery Partners as they see fit. It remains the responsibility of the Grant Recipient to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meet all obligations of the Grant Recipient under the Grant Funding Agreement</li>
  <li>Carry out performance management of any Activity Delivery Partner the Grant Recipient uses</li>
</ul>

<p>23.	Grant Recipients must ensure <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> continues to be delivered in accordance with the Grant Funding</p>

<h3>Agreement</h3>

<p>24.	Each Grant Recipient must ensure that in carrying out the Funded Activities, it complies with all of its obligations under the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 including, but not limited to, in relation to any records relating to the Participant and the Participant’s involvement with the Initiative. In the event of a freedom of information request being submitted, the Grant Recipient will be responsible for all aspects that relate to delivery of the Initiative. However, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be responsible for requests in relation to strategic intent and policy.</p>

<p>25.	Grant Recipients must acknowledge and act in accordance with their duty of care to protect vulnerable adults enrolled on the Initiative during all activities related to it. This includes ensuring that all Grant Recipient staff, Activity Delivery Partners and employers are appropriately trained and that sufficient background checks have been carried out to safeguard Participants in line with the Grant Recipient’s existing safeguarding policy for vulnerable adults.</p>

<p>26.	Grant Recipients will be required to collect <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> to support Grant funding payments and validation of payment of Grants.</p>

<p>27.	Grant Recipients who deliver <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> to members of the public in Wales should be aware that they must comply with and fully understand their obligations regarding the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Welsh Language Scheme.</p>

<p>28.	All communications with Grant Recipients will be issued to the Grant Recipient’s <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>. It is the responsibility of Grant Recipients to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of any change to <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> details.</p>

<p>29.	 The Grant Recipient must, as appropriate and practical, reference that the Grant is funded by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or UK Government in any publicity material, including online channels and media releases. Materials produced by Grant Recipients must not adversely affect the reputation of the Initiative or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or the government, for example the Grant Recipient should not produce marketing materials, communications or messages which could lead to adverse media attention, or could be misunderstood or misinterpreted.</p>

<p>30.	Grant Recipients must ensure that all Participants can access information and must ensure such information is available in a variety of alternative formats which may be requested by Participants.</p>

<p>31.	Any complaints and conflict management in relation to Funded Activities must be handled by the Grant Recipient in line with their established complaints management policies and procedures.</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>

<p>Once the successful <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> have been selected, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will facilitate invitations to face-to-face regional workshops and teleconferences throughout the Initiative; allowing Grant Recipients to share their experiences and help each other resolve any issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> aims to commence joint working with an All MS Teams call with all the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOCs</abbr> who have submitted an Expression of Interest form for the Initiative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first face-to-face workshops will be delivered in August 2022 (dates and locations to be confirmed once successful <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are known)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow up face-to-face meetings and teleconferences are expected to take place as and when required</p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>32.	Each Grant Recipient will be assigned and made aware of their Regional Engagement Lead (<abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr>), who will work with Grant Recipients, share good practice and provide ongoing support to Grant Recipients throughout the Initiative implementation and delivery phases.</p>

<p>33.	<abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> support will continue throughout the Funding Period until March 2025.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Grant Funding</h2>

<h3>Payment Model</h3>

<p>44.	The Grant will consist of Regular Payments and Provision Payments, in addition to reimbursement of the costs of Fidelity Assessments as set out in paragraph 111. The total amount of the Grant payable to the Grant Recipient will not in any circumstances exceed the Maximum Sum specified in the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<p>45.	The total of all Regular Payments (“Regular Payments Total”) will be calculated as £2,450 x the number of Participants the Grant Recipient proposed to start on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> as indicated in the Grant Recipient’s Grant Application or as agreed with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, i.e. 70% of the Grant Funding per Participant (£3,500). The Regular Payments Total will be paid as Regular Payments of equal amounts paid in arrears following the relevant Instalment Period over the 11 Instalment Periods of the Funding Period.</p>

<p>46.	The total of the Provision Payments payable for each Participant who has a Start On Provision which occurs from the start of the Activity Delivery Period until the end of the  22nd month of the Funding Period (both dates inclusive) will be £1,050, i.e. 30% of the Grant Funding per Participant (£3,500), which will be payable as follows (figures rounded to 2 decimal places):</p>

<p>i. the first Provision Payment in respect of an eligible Participant will be payable following the Instalment Period in which the relevant Start On Provision occurred (the “Relevant Instalment Period”) and will be calculated as £36.21 per month x the number of months from the start of the Activity Delivery Period until the end of the Relevant Instalment Period; and</p>

<p>ii. a payment of £108.62 (i.e. £36.21 per month x 3) will be made in respect of each Instalment Period for the first nine 3-month Instalment Periods of the Activity Delivery Period and a payment of £72.41 (i.e. £36.21 per month x 2) will be paid for the final 2-month Instalment Period each paid after the Relevant Instalment Period to the end of the Funding Period.</p>

<p>No Provision Payment will be made in respect of the Implementation Period or in respect of any Participant whose Start On Provision is after the end of the 22nd month of the Funding Period unless otherwise agreed in writing by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Provision Payments will be paid in arrears following the relevant Instalment Period.</p>

<p>47.	At the end of each Instalment Period during the Funding Period, the Regular Payment and the Provision Payment (if payable for that Instalment Period) will be transferred to the Grant Recipient as a combined single amount (“Combined Instalment Period Payment”). The first Regular Payment is expected to be made in November 2022 to contribute to the set up and implementation costs incurred by the Grant Recipient up to 31 October 2022. Further Regular Payments will be made following each Instalment Period in arrears until the end of the Funding Period.</p>

<p>48.	The first Provision Payment is expected to be made in March/January 2023 following receipt by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reports in relation to Participants which the Grant Recipient has started on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> in the first 3 months of the Activity Delivery Period. Further Provision Payments will be paid following each Instalment Period in arrears, subject to <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reports, in relation to Participants with a Start On Provision during the relevant Instalment Period (in addition to continuing payments for eligible Participants who have already started).</p>

<p>49.	Grant Recipients need to consider their provision start profile over the first 19 months of the Activity Delivery Period so that the last 10 months of the Activity Delivery Period are solely focused on Job Starts and supporting Participants in employment. To manage DWPs internal yearly budget allocations <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to defer Regular Payments and/or Provision Payments to the following year if a Grant Recipient exceeds its projected profile of Participants starting on provision, provided always that the Grant payable to the Grant Recipient will not in any circumstances exceed the Maximum Sum specified in the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<p>50.	Expenditure Returns must be endorsed by the Grant Recipient’s Section 151 officer in accordance with their statutory assurance responsibility by the Grant Recipient copying its Chief Financial Officer and Section 151 Officer into the email.</p>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example 1 – Regular Payment</h3>

<p>LA applies for 80 Starts On Provision.</p>

<p>Unit regular payment (70% of £3,500) = £2,450</p>

<p>Total Regular Payment = (unit regular payment) £2,450 x (number of placements) 80 = £196,000
Implementation Period ends October 2022</p>

<p>Activity Delivery Period runs from November 2022 to March 25 = 29 months or 10 Instalment Periods. 11 Instalment Periods in total including Implementation Period.</p>

<p>Regular Payment for the first ten 3-month Instalment Periods = (total Regular Payment) £196,000 divided by (number of months of the Initiative including the Implementation Period) 32 multiplied by (months in Instalment Period) 3 = £18,375 (Instalment Period Regular Payment)</p>

<p>The last Instalment Period is 2-months and the Regular Payment = (total Regular Payment) £196,000 divided by (number of months of the Initiative including the Implementation Period) 32 multiplied by (months in final Instalment Period) 2 = £12,250 (Final Instalment Period Regular Payment)</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<h3>Example 2 – Provision Payment</h3>

<p>LA applies for 140 Starts On Provision.</p>

<p>Unit provision payment (30% of £3,500) = £1,050</p>

<p>Unit provision payment divided over 29 month Activity Delivery Period = £1,050/29 = £36.21* per month per Start On Provision, £108.62* per 3 month Instalment Period</p>

<p>LA reports 0 Starts On Provision for November-January 2023 Instalment Period, provision payment due in next Instalment Period payment = £0</p>

<p>LA reports 10 Starts On Provision over February-April 2023 Instalment Period
Unit provision payment (£36.21<em>) x Starts On Provision (10) = £362.06</em> x months elapsed since the beginning of Activity Delivery Period (6) =£2,172.41* to be paid in the next Instalment Period payment. A payment of £1,086.21* (£36.21* unit provision payment x 10 Participants x 3 months) will be paid each Instalment Period thereafter</p>

<p>*All payment figures are rounded to 2 decimal places</p>
</div>

<h3>Payment Model examples</h3>

<p>The above are some examples of how Regular Payments and Provision Payments may be calculated. These examples are given for guidance only and do not constitute an undertaking by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to use any particular basis for calculation or to pay any particular amounts.</p>

<p>51.	Payment may be withheld if an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> fails to meet performance targets once <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> considers that all other reasonable avenues of performance management have been exhausted. This paragraph does not affect the rights and remedies of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> under the Grant Funding Agreement.
Match Funding</p>

<p>52.	The Grant Recipient Match Funding is expected to be to the value of at least £1,500 per Participant. Grant Recipient Match Funding may take the form of funds, staff, resources or expenditure which must be in addition to the funds, staff resources or expenditure covered by the Grant.</p>

<p>53.	The Grant Recipient Match Funding can take the form of funds, staff, resources or expenditure in any of the Cost Categories identified in the Eligible Expenditure section below provided such costs arise solely and directly from the implementation and delivery of the Initiative and are in addition to and separate from the costs of any existing Supported Employment services or activities the Grant Recipient may provide. 
Eligible Expenditure</p>

<p>54.	The Grant must be used for expenditure incurred by the Grant Recipient solely  arising from the implementation and delivery of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> and which comes under the following cost categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Administration costs incurred by the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> in administering its delivery of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Staffing costs</li>
  <li>Marketing/advertising costs including webpage design</li>
  <li>Costs of training of staff and Participants</li>
  <li>Cost of staging/attending employment events such as job fairs</li>
  <li>Transport costs where a Participant would not otherwise be able to attend employment/training</li>
  <li>Costs associated with providing care for Participants</li>
  <li>Costs associated with DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks</li>
  <li>Participant’s childcare costs or Replacement Care Costs. See paragraphs 57 and 63 for further details</li>
</ul>

<p>55.	Grant Recipients should signpost Participants towards agencies who can support Participants with appropriate advice. This could include helping Participants to access <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Access to Work programme, where appropriate.</p>

<p>56.	To be Eligible Expenditure under <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>, all expenditure must be in addition to any other Supported Employment activities or services available from the Grant Recipient. For example, expenditure on Grant Recipient <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> job coach costs must be in addition to Grant Recipient staff delivering other Supported Employment activities or services available from the Grant Recipient and work placements provided by the Grant Recipient to Participants must be additional to those offered by the Grant Recipient under any other Supported Employment activities or services available from the Grant Recipient.</p>

<h3>Childcare Costs</h3>

<p>57.	Where it is a barrier to participation in the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>, childcare costs will constitute Eligible Expenditure by the Grant Recipient. Childcare costs in connection with attendance will only constitute Eligible Expenditure, if such childcare is provided by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carers registered with <abbr title="Office for Standards in Education">OFSTED</abbr> (Office for Standards in Education);</li>
  <li>carers registered with Care Inspectorate Wales</li>
  <li>a carer accredited under the Childcare Approval Scheme, run on school premises out of school hours or as an out of hours club by an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>, or</li>
  <li>schools or establishments exempted from registration under the Children Act 1989 or operated on Crown property</li>
</ul>

<p>If a Participant who is a parent or guardian arranges childcare with a carer/school/establishment not in the categories identified above then the costs of such childcare will not be covered by the Grant.</p>

<p>58.	The Grant Recipient must ensure that Participants are informed that the Grant covers childcare costs for Participants on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>59.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> currently sets its costs for childcare up to the Tax Credit limits. Grant Recipients should consider the following limits when developing and pricing their proposals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help with childcare costs can be paid up to, but not including, the first Tuesday in the September following the child’s fifteenth birthday</li>
  <li>Participants who are parents and require childcare for five days a week can claim up to a maximum of £175 per week for one child and £300 per week for two or more children</li>
  <li>If the Participant is attending an approved activity of less than five days a week, they can claim up to the maximum daily rates of £35 per day for one child and £60 per day for two or more children</li>
</ul>

<p>60.	The child/children must satisfy the age requirement and be a dependent of and reside with the Participant.</p>

<p>61.	Grant Recipients would be expected to avoid recommending particular childcare facilities to Participants.</p>

<p>62.	Grant Recipients or Activity Delivery Partners may choose to arrange for a crèche facility to be on their premises. However, they must ensure it is the Participant parents’ choice whether their child uses the facility. Grant Recipients should also ensure that any crèche facilities adhere to current legislation.</p>

<p>63.	Replacement Care Costs – Grant Recipients are expected to fund Replacement Care Costs for Participants, who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aged 18 or over (16 or over in Wales)</li>
  <li>not in work, and</li>
  <li>spend a significant proportion of their lives providing unpaid support to relatives, partners or friends who are ill, frail, disabled or have a mental health or substance misuse problem</li>
</ul>

<p>64.	Replacement Care Costs may constitute Eligible Expenditure where such costs are:</p>

<p>(i) incurred in respect of Participants who are carers participating in Funded Activities in connection with <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> which has been requested/arranged/approved by the Grant Recipient; and/or</p>

<p>(ii) the Replacement Care Costs are on a one-off basis, for example where the Participant is attending an interview with the Grant Recipient or prospective employer which has been pre-arranged/agreed by the Grant Recipient. Other alternatives, such as moving the time/date of an interview or activity, should be considered before Replacement Care Costs are incurred by the Grant Recipient.</p>

<p>65.	The Grant Recipient must ensure that Participants are informed that the Grant covers Replacement Care Costs for Participants on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>66.	Replacement Care Costs will not be covered by the Grant if the replacement care is provided by family members of the Participant.</p>

<p>67.	Replacement care must be provided by providers of care registered with the local authority or a care organisation registered with either the Care Inspectorate Wales or the Care Quality Commission (England) within the Individual’s (and by extension, the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>’s) respective local area.</p>

<p>68.	Grant Recipients would be expected to avoid recommending particular replacement care facilities to Participants.</p>

<h3>Ineligible Expenditure</h3>

<p>69.	Ineligible Expenditure shall include but not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any contribution to the Participant’s salary</li>
  <li>the cost of submitting the Grant Application</li>
  <li>incentives paid to Participants</li>
  <li>contributions in kind</li>
  <li>interest payments or service charge payments for finance leases</li>
  <li>gifts</li>
  <li>statutory fines, criminal fines or penalties civil penalties, damages or any associated legal costs</li>
  <li>payments for works or activities which the Grant Recipient, or any member of staff of the Grant Recipient or their Activity Delivery Partner, has a statutory duty to undertake, or that are fully funded by other sources</li>
  <li>bad debts to related parties</li>
  <li>payments for unfair dismissal or other compensation</li>
  <li>depreciation, amortisation or impairment of assets owned by the Grant Recipient</li>
  <li>the acquisition or improvement of assets by the Grant Recipient (unless the Grant is explicitly for capital use – this will be stipulated in the Grant Funding Letter)</li>
  <li>liabilities incurred before the commencement of the Grant Funding Agreement unless agreed in writing by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fraud</h3>

<p>70.	Grant Recipients should ensure that Activity Delivery Partners are genuine, qualified and capable of delivering the required Funded Activities, and that the use of the Activity Delivery Partner by the Grant Recipient represents value for money. This may include the Grant Recipient carrying out due diligence, pre-procurement checks, ongoing performance management of all Activity Delivery Partners and the Grant Recipient making payments in arrears to all Activity Delivery Partners.</p>

<p>71.	In the event that the Grant Recipient  knows or suspects or should have known or suspected, that fraudulent activity of any kind has taken place in connection with <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> or the Grant, the Grant Recipient  must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> immediately providing full details of the fraudulent activity, including but not limited to, the nature, the scope  and the total monetary value of the fraudulent activity.</p>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>72.	The Grant Recipient should seek its own independent advice regarding the VAT implications of the Grant, the Regular Payments and the Provision Payments.</p>

<p>73.	If Grant Recipients elect to charge VAT on payments made to them by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> then they must provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with full VAT invoices alongside the <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> report at the next reporting period.</p>

<p>74.	If Grant Recipients incur VAT from Activity Delivery Partners or third-party suppliers, this remains the responsibility of the Grant Recipient. VAT costs incurred by the Grant Recipient should not be passed on to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and VAT costs incurred by the Grant Recipient do not constitute Eligible Expenditure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Timeline</h2>

<p>75.	The deadline for <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> to submit a Grant Applications is 5pm on 26 May 2022. Information and support regarding the Grant Application process can be obtained by sending questions to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Grant Team.</p>

<p>76.	Grant Applications will be assessed in May/June 2022 and <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will be notified of the outcome in July 2022. If an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> is successful, it is expected that they will then begin the process of finding and training Activity Delivery Partners (if applicable) as well as resourcing and staff training. <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will have a 3-month implementation window before commencement of the Activity Delivery Period with Grant Recipients beginning to actively recruit and support Participants into employment from November 2022 to March 2025. More details are provided in the table below. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will make every effort to notify <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> who submit Grant Applications as early as possible in the event that the timeline needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>Note: *Dates TBC</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Implementation Period</h2>

<p>77.	During the 3-month Implementation Period, <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should deliver the implementation activities outlined in their application (which will form part of the Funded Activities), such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appointment of Activity Delivery Partners and training partners, if applicable</li>
  <li>relevant recruitment and training carried out</li>
  <li>development of supporting processes and procedures ready for service</li>
  <li>marketing of the Initiative</li>
  <li>regular engagement with <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Activity Delivery Period</h2>

<p>78.	The Activity Delivery Period runs from 1 November 2022 to 31 March 2025 and is made up of two phases: Recruitment Phase and Participant Support Phase.</p>

<p>79.	During the Recruitment Phase <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will be seeking to identify potential Participants, establishing eligibility and supporting Participants in their job search and into employment.</p>

<p>80.	The last 10 months of the Initiative is the Participant Support Phase. No Provision Payments will be payable in respect of Participants who start on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> after 19 months from the start of the Activity Delivery Period. It is expected that Grant Recipients will be working with Participants through the stages of Supported Employment for a minimum of 10 months and therefore the last 10 months of the Initiative will be for Grant Recipients to support existing Participants. Note: <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should consider in their recruitment plans that the average period of support for Participants is 12 months.</p>

<p>81.	At the transition point from Recruitment Phase to Participant Support Phase, if there are reasonable grounds for exception to the rule that no Provision Payments will be payable in respect of Participants who start on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> after 19 months from the start of the Activity Delivery Period, Grant Recipients may discuss this with the <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> and it will be considered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>82.	The Grant Recipient must seek consent from all Participants and potential Participants to the sharing of data with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to check eligibility and to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to evaluate the Initiative. The Grant Recipient must ensure a Participant agreement template at <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c">Annex C</a> is signed by all potential Participants before any Eligibility Check can be sent to the jobcentre <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr>.</p>

<p>83.	Where the potential Participant is on existing provision that is due to end within the next six months, the Jobcentre <abbr title="Single point of contact">SPOC</abbr> will notify the Grant Recipient to check eligibility again after the relevant timescale. It is up to the Grant Recipient to re-send the Eligibility Check Template after this time has elapsed if they wish to check if the potential Participant’s eligibility status has changed.</p>

<p>84.	Grant Recipients should consider the Participant’s ability to give consent if appropriate and consider carer’s consent if there is permission to act on behalf of the Participant.</p>

<h3>Grant Recipient / Activity Delivery Partner Interaction with Participant</h3>

<p>85.	Grant Recipients are required to update Participants following the Eligibility Check.</p>

<p>86.	All travel costs, costs associated with personal protective equipment and childcare will be met by Grant Recipients as explained in Section 4 of this Guidance.</p>

<h3>Participant leaves provision</h3>

<p>89.	Participants may leave <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> provision for a number of reasons, including but not limited to starting work, failing to engage with the programme after <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has been notified that they have started on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> provision or the Participant no longer wishing to participate. Grant Recipients should record the reason against the most appropriate option in the <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> template and provide any additional notes if required.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> and reporting requirements</h2>

<p>90.	There will be an <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> template to complete and return to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> each month. This will include a summary of the costs incurred by the Grant Recipient or Cluster Member that month and the number of staff working on the Initiative (within the Grant Recipient, a Cluster Member and / or a Activity Delivery Partner), over and above those delivering supported employment provision other than <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>91.	The <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reporting template will comprise of a summary sheet and a Participant tab for each Participant to enable the Grant Recipient to record how the Participant is progressing through the Initiative, i.e., provision start date, job start date, number of hours worked, earnings and any changes to their working pattern throughout the period of the Initiative.</p>

<p>92.	The <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> template can be found in Appendix D. It should be returned by the 14th of each month, containing updates on progress achieved over the previous month to give a cumulative picture of Participant progress on the Initiative. <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> templates should be returned to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>93.	Grant Recipients will need to obtain and retain evidence to provide assurance to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> relating to hours worked, earnings and duration of employment, for example, information and documentation provided by the employer, wage slips, any Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) checks carried out with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, evidence of self-employment.</p>

<p>94.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor performance of the Grant Recipient for the duration of the Initiative against the Profile Template <a class="govuk-link" href="#append-c">Appendix C</a> of forecasted Starts On Provision, staffing level and expenditure completed by the Grant Recipient as part of the Grant Application.</p>

<p>95.	Assurance may be sought by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or its commissioned representatives through a variety of means, including but not limited to reviewing the Grant Recipient audit trail of evidence held to support the Funded Activities, consulting with the Participant and or their employer(s), and/or through referring to other sources which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> deems appropriate such as Government held data e.g., <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, or Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) records, etc.</p>

<p>96.	The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> team will review the monthly <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> reports provided by Grant Recipients. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> team will:</p>

<p>i. Monitor progress and produce a monthly report showing progress across all Grant Recipients in the Initiative</p>

<p>ii. Arrange for an Instalment Period Grant payment to be made to Grant Recipients made up of a Regular Payment and a Provision Payment based on the number of valid Starts On Provision reported in the <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> for the preceding Instalment Period</p>

<p>iii. Engage with Grant Recipients where progress is falling behind the Grant Recipient’s forecasts with a view to developing an improvement plan.</p>

<p>97.	Each Grant Recipient will be assigned a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Regional Engagement Lead <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr>. The <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> will:</p>

<p>i. Support the Grant Recipient through implementation</p>

<p>ii. Share good practice across Grant Recipients</p>

<p>iii. Provide support to Grant Recipients during delivery of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr></p>

<p>98.	Grant Recipients will work with RELs to demonstrate adherence to the Grant Funding Agreement and the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model and provide associated evidence to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for quality assurance purposes.</p>

<p>99.	When monitoring the monthly <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> returns the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> team will contact Grant Recipients to understand the reasons for <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> shortfalls and will work collaboratively with the Grant Recipient and the <abbr title="Regional Engagement Lead">REL</abbr> to agree actions for improvement. Grant payments may be withheld or the Grant Funding Agreement may be terminated if <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> determines that there are repeated problems which the Grant Recipient has failed to resolve to the satisfaction of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will work in partnership with Grant Recipients wherever possible to resolve problems.</p>

<p>100.	Some of the areas of the <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> report that the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Team may contact the Grant Recipient to discuss could include but are not limited to:</p>

<p>i. Staff input</p>

<p>ii. Grant Recipient Match Funding</p>

<p>iii. Number of Participants who have started on provision (compared to the forecast provided by the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>). Please note that the actual number of Participants starting on provision will determine the amount of the Instalment Period Provision Payment to the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr></p>

<p>iv. Number of Job Starts including:</p>

<p>i. Duration of job placements e.g., over 13 weeks</p>

<p>ii. Numbers of hours worked e.g., over 8hrs and over 16hrs p/w</p>

<p>iii. Earnings bands</p>

<p>101. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Team will identify performance issues through analysis of <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> returns and Fidelity Assessments and will co-ordinate performance management intervention (which may include requiring a Remedial Action Plan) in respect of the following key performance indicators:</p>

<p>i. A Grant Recipient making referrals of less than 90% of the number of Starts On Provision which the Grant Recipient proposed in the Profile Template as part of the Grant Application</p>

<p>ii. A Grant Recipient achieving less than 70% of the number of Starts On Provision which the Grant Recipient proposed in the Profile Template as part of the Grant Application</p>

<p>iii. A Grant Recipient achieving Job Starts for less than 30% of the number of Starts On Provision</p>

<p>iv. More than 10% of the Participants who Start On Provision leave before 10 months for reasons other than a Job Start, and</p>

<p>v. A Grant Recipient failing to comply with a Remedial Action Plan</p>

<p>102. Grant Recipients or their Activity Delivery Partners will be scored as part of a Fidelity Assessment where they do not have the model fidelity quality accreditation for supported employment (see Section 10). Grant Recipients will work to develop and improve the <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> provided, as set out in the resulting Assessment Action Plan.</p>

<p>103. Where performance issues are identified, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> intends to work with the Grant Recipient to provide support and agree a Remedial Action Plan (without affecting the rights and remedies of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> under the Grant Funding Agreement).  Please note that Grant payments may be withheld in the circumstances set out in clause 26 of the grant funding conditions.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> Template Completion</h3>

<p>104. The ‘Grant Recipient Summary Sheet’ should be populated each month with the current <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> staffing level relating to the reporting month, and the total, cumulative numbers to the end of the reporting month for each data item. There is also the opportunity to capture relevant notes or information that give additional context to the reported information.</p>

<p>105. The ‘Participant Reporting’ tab should be populated as follows:</p>

<p>i. Participant Reference Number – This is the number that the Grant Recipient has assigned to the Participant that allows for anonymised information to be reported. This reference number should be specific to a Participant and used to maintain reporting of a Participant’s progress on the Initiative</p>

<p>ii. Date of Referral to <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> – This is the date that a potential Participant is identified or referred to the Grant Recipient for consideration</p>

<p>iii. Referral Route – Dropdown to confirm if the potential Participant was identified and referred by Adult Social Care, known to the Grant Recipient directly, or by other means</p>

<p>iv. Type of Disability – Dropdown to allow selection of ‘learning disability’, ‘autism’ or ‘learning disability and autism’</p>

<p>v. Date Eligibility Check issued and date Eligibility Check returned – Relate to the dates of send and return of the Eligibility Check Template Annex B</p>

<p>vi. Eligible/Not Eligible and ‘where not eligible, reason for decision’ – Record the outcome of the Eligibility Check and the reason for the not eligible decision as a dropdown (where applicable)</p>

<p>vii. Start Date on <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> – This field being populated with a date results in Grant payment. Starting On Provision is defined as the first meeting between a Grant Recipient and a Participant following confirmation of eligibility, where the Participant signs up to the Initiative</p>

<p>viii. Start Date of Vocational Profiling / Start Date Employer Search / Date First Employment Identified / Date of Successful Job Offer – Dates entered to demonstrate progress along Supported Employment journey</p>

<p>ix. Job Title / Job Start Date – If more than one employment secured, use the first employment to complete these fields</p>

<p>x. Working Pattern Start/Change Date / Working Pattern / Earnings – These fields can be used to demonstrate changes within an employment or as a whole for a Participant, for example, an increase in hours over time</p>

<p>xi. Job Outcome – Dropdown for Grant Recipients to select ‘yes’ when a Participant reaches 8 hours paid employment per week for 13 weeks and 16 hours per week for 13 weeks over a 26-week period</p>

<p>xii. Ending <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> – Enter date the Participant left <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> provision and select a reason for leaving from the dropdown list provided</p>

<p>xiii. Summary of activities to support Job Start – There are 3 free text fields for Grant Recipient’s to record notes about the support and activities undertaken to assist a Participant in a job search. If a Participant only has one job search period over their time on the Initiative, only the first of these fields should be populated</p>

<p>xiv. Summary of employment support – There are 2 free text fields for the Grant Recipient to record notes about the support provided to the Participant whilst in employment. If the Participant only has one period of employment, only the first of these fields should be populated</p>

<p>106. There are tabs for quarterly reporting on Expenditure Return.  Grant Recipients should capture all Initiative-related expenditure over the 3-month period as a cumulative total from the start of the Initiative against each expenditure type stated to show adherence to Grant Recipient Match Funding commitment.  If an <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> wishes to claim reimbursement for spend on Fidelity Assessments, this should also be captured here.</p>

<p>107. Each quarterly Expenditure Return must include your Section 151 Officer’s name and email address to provide assurance on validation of funding spend. Where a funding application has been submitted for a Cluster the S151 Officer for the Grant Recipient (being the lead member of the Cluster) should provide the necessary assurance for the Cluster.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Fidelity Assessment</h2>

<h3>Grant Recipients or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner who do not have a Fidelity accreditation for delivery of Supported Employment for this target group</h3>

<p>108. Grant Recipients will be required to arrange for all Activity Delivery Partners to undertake a Fidelity Assessment assessing adherence to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.base-uk.org/model-fidelity" rel="external">Supported Employment Quality Framework (<abbr title="Supported Employment Quality Framework">SEQF</abbr>)</a>. The Fidelity Assessments should be carried out by a supplier appointed by the Grant Recipient.</p>

<p>109. The purpose of the Fidelity Assessment is to assess adherence to best practice in respect of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr>. The Fidelity Assessor will provide tailored advice and support to each Grant Recipient or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner and identify opportunities for improvement in a Fidelity Assessment Action Plan.</p>

<p>110. Grant Recipients and their appointed Activity Delivery Partner should undertake a self-assessment. Grant Recipients or the Activity Delivery Partner should agree two external Fidelity Audits during the period of the Initiative, one between month 6 and month 12 of the Activity Delivery Period and the second between month 13 and month 24 of the Activity Delivery Period. They will be given a score based on their first Fidelity Assessment and a Fidelity Assessment Action Plan will be drafted to address any weaknesses or gaps identified through the assessment. Grant Recipients and their Activity Delivery Partners will then be given a score based on their second Fidelity Assessment. Grant Recipients and their Activity Delivery Partners should aim for an increase in their scores between the first and second Fidelity Assessments.</p>

<p>111. The Grant will include reimbursing the cost of up to £4,500 per Fidelity Assessment, a total of £9,000 for up to two Fidelity Assessments carried out over the course of the Initiative. Cost of Fidelity Assessments can be claimed via the <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> template quarterly expenditure tab, and evidence of spend should be provided with the appropriate <abbr title="Management information">MI</abbr> return. Costs of Fidelity Assessments will be included in the next Instalment Period Grant payment.</p>

<p>112. Grant Recipients and their Activity Delivery Partner, where relevant, must fully engage with the Fidelity Assessment process, complete the actions outlined in the Fidelity Assessment Action Plan in the period between the first and second Fidelity Assessments and fully utilise the assistance on offer from the Fidelity Assessment provider.</p>

<p>113. The agreed Fidelity Assessment Action Plan following each Fidelity Assessment must be shared with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for performance monitoring.</p>

<p>114. Should a Grant Recipient outsource all or part of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> to one or more Activity Delivery Partners, each Activity Delivery Partner must undergo separate Fidelity Assessments. However only the cost of two Fidelity Assessments, (i.e., up to a total of £9,000) will be included by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as part of the Grant payment. Grant Recipients will have to fund any additional Fidelity Assessments themselves.</p>

<h3>Grant Recipients or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner who do have Fidelity accreditation for delivery of Supported Employment for this target group</h3>

<p>115. Where a Grant Recipient or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner has already secured Supported Employment accreditation, e.g., a quality kitemark for this target group, they should confirm this as part of the Grant Application and ensure this accreditation is retained for the duration of the Initiative. Fidelity accreditations are awarded to organisations that meet the <abbr title="Supported Employment Quality Framework">SEQF</abbr> criteria by independent supported employment auditors and if successful in their application, the Grant Recipient or their approved Activity Delivery Partner will be asked to provide evidence of this. While they hold and retain Fidelity accreditation, the Grant Recipient or their appointed Activity Delivery Partner will not need to undertake any further formal Fidelity Assessments throughout the Funding Period.</p>

<p>116.	The Grant Recipient and each Activity Delivery Partner must commit to maintaining their Fidelity accreditation throughout the Funding Period. The cost of maintaining any Fidelity accreditation will not be paid by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and will not be included in any Grant payment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Annual grant review</h2>

<p>117.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review the Grant annually. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will take into account the Grant Recipient’s delivery of the Funded Activities in accordance with the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<p>118. Each annual review may result in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> making a decision which may include but is not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the Funded Activities and the Grant Funding Agreement should continue in line with existing plans.</li>
  <li>that there should be an increase or decrease in the Grant for the subsequent Financial Year</li>
  <li>that the Starts On Provision should be re-profiled and agreed</li>
  <li>that the Grant Recipient should provide <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with and implement a draft Remedial Action Plan setting out the steps the Grant Recipient will take to improve delivery of the Funded Activities</li>
  <li>that the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> should recover any Unspent Monies</li>
  <li>that the Grant be terminated in accordance with the Grant Funding Agreement</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Annexes</h2>

<h2>Annex A: 5 Stage Supported Employment Model</h2>

<h3>Stage 1 – Customer (Participant) Engagement</h3>

<h4>Marketing and Promotion of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> Trailblazer</h4>

<p>The responsibility lies with the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> to identify and engage with eligible Participants and all recruitment within the referral window.</p>

<h4>Initial Customer Engagement</h4>

<p><abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are responsible for all initial engagement activity with the Participant which will include a discussion with the Participant regarding the provision to determine if it is the right programme for them. This engagement would be preferable face to face. If circumstances mean this isn’t possible, alternative contact channels should be considered.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> are required to gain the Participant’s consent to share information to enable the Eligibility Check to take place and other data to be gathered for the purposes of performance management and evaluation of the Initiative.</p>

<h4>Job Coach Assigned and Introductory meeting</h4>

<p>Once a Participant is confirmed as eligible, the Participant must be assigned a job coach who will be their point of contact for the duration of their time on provision.</p>

<p>The Participant must be informed of their eligibility, and the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> must make arrangements for an introductory meeting.</p>

<p>An introductory meeting between the Participant and their assigned job coach must be held within 10 working days of the Participant agreement to join the provision. Once the introductory meeting has been held, and the claimant has agreed and signed up to the support they will be regarded as having started the programme.</p>

<h3>Stage 2 – Vocational Profiling</h3>

<p>The initial vocational assessment is a “living document” and updated over time with information from work experiences in competitive jobs. The resulting vocational profile includes information about preferences, experiences, skills, needs, strengths, support networks, etc., and is updated to reflect learning from workplace experiences. Sources of information include the Participant, and with their permission, family members, carers, education/training providers and previous employers.</p>

<p>Undertaking labour market research and employer engagement is a natural part of vocational profiling to allow the individual to make informed choice over their career aspirations.</p>

<p>This stage should include as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss with the Participant their preferences, skills and needs</li>
  <li>Develop and agree an Action Plan with the Participant</li>
  <li>Discussions with the Participant’s circle of support where appropriate and applicable</li>
  <li>Meeting frequency should be at least on a weekly basis</li>
  <li>A discussion with the Participant regarding financial factors including impact of work on overall income and benefit eligibility</li>
  <li>Consideration of non-work factors which may be a barrier to employment</li>
  <li>Action Plan and Review</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Participant should have an Action Plan which should be developed and agreed between the Participant and the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> job coach and this should be regularly updated with any actions planned and taken.</p>

<p>Progress reviews must be conducted regularly and the Action Plan should be updated after each review. 
If the programme is not deemed to be a suitable provision for the Participant, <abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> should discuss alternative support is more appropriate.</p>

<h3>Stage 3 – Engaging Employers</h3>

<p>Job Coaches should develop a range of employer contacts aimed at identifying a good job match based on Participant preferences (relating to what each person enjoys and their personal goals), strengths (including experience, skills etc.) and needs (including health needs, concentration and stamina levels etc) rather than those jobs that are most immediately available. An individualised job search plan is developed and updated with information from the vocational assessment/profile form and new job/educational experiences.</p>

<p>The provider must support employers to develop, design or customise jobs, negotiating with the employer to agree reasonable adjustments and ensure a risk assessment to address equality and diversity, health and safety and safeguarding issues is completed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> will use their knowledge and expertise to build relationships with employers, adhering to best practice and the 5 Stage Supported Employment Model to engage employers and ensure the best outcomes for Participants.</p>

<p>This will include as a minimum:</p>

<p>Utilise sources of local labour market intelligence to identify employers.</p>

<p>Articulating the business case for employing people with disabilities and supported employment and be able to address employer’s concerns.</p>

<p>Seeking competitive and inclusive employment and providing support to employers to help them to recruit a diverse workforce.</p>

<p>Ensure that the employer is aware of their responsibilities and relevant legislation to ensure that workplaces are safe and to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of Participants.</p>

<h4>Sharing of personal information:</h4>

<p>Job Coaches provide Participants with accurate information and assist with evaluating their choices to make an informed decision regarding what is revealed to the employer about having a learning disability or autism or both.</p>

<p>The provider should advise and support employers to overcome barriers. For example, employers should be encouraged to use “working interviews” which allow individuals to demonstrate their skills in the workplace rather than rely on traditional recruitment and selection methods such as formal interviews which can discriminate against some people with learning disability.</p>

<h3>Stage 4 – Vocational Profiling/Job Matching</h3>

<p>Eligible employment for the purposes of <abbr title="Local Supported Employment">LSE</abbr> must follow the principles:</p>

<p>Wages are paid at the Going Rate Of Pay for the job. This must be at least the National Living Wage per hour rate.</p>

<p>The employee enjoys the same terms and conditions as all other employees</p>

<p>The job helps the person meet their life goals and aspirations</p>

<p>The role is valued by managers and colleagues</p>

<p>The job has similar hours and times at work as other employees, with safe working conditions</p>

<p>This stage will involve working closely with partners so that the Participant and employers get the best possible job match taking into account the Participant’s vocational profile, their skills and abilities and the activities and requirements of the role.</p>

<p>Rapid job search for competitive open market employment should begin at the earliest appropriate opportunity. Initial employment assessment and first job application/face-to-face employer contact by the Participant or the Job</p>

<p>Coach about a competitive job, should ideally occur as soon as sufficient insight is achieved through vocational profiling.</p>

<p>This will include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Analysis of the job opportunity to ensure the job and environment are suitable for the candidate. The job analysis should identify the core requirements for the job role, the employer’s targets for quality and productivity and any relevant cultural issues.</li>
  <li>Discussion with the individual and/or the employer to identify if any extra assistance or alteration to working practice or the environment are needed.</li>
  <li>May involve techniques such as job carving, job design and analysis of the role to best meet the needs of the individual and employer.</li>
  <li>Provide advice and guidance to the employer as appropriate, ensuring they have knowledge of reasonable adjustments, Access to Work and other support that can help them to ensure they are prepared to appropriately support the individual.</li>
  <li>Training, work experience, volunteering and short internships are not considered competitive paid jobs but as work skills development and preparation opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<p>All activity undertaken should be recorded in the Action Plan.</p>

<p>Note: Stages 3 and 4 can take place concurrently with Stage 2 Vocational Profiling. In the event that finding the most suitable job takes time, the Participant should continue with any relevant actions on their Action Plan, which might include vocational skills learning. All Participants are offered assistance in obtaining comprehensive, individualised work incentives planning before starting a new job and assistance accessing employment benefits planning thereafter when making decisions about changes in work hours and pay. Employment benefits planning includes the impact on all sources of income and fringe benefits (Personal Independence Payments, travel concession, Working Tax Credits, Universal Credit etc.) and all costs associated with commencing or changing employment. Participants are provided information and assistance about reporting earnings to any other programme that needs to know the new income details (e.g., Housing, Council Tax, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> etc.). The use of the Access to Work scheme needs to be considered to provide support and adjustments in work.</p>

<h3>Stage 5 – In-Work Support and Career Development</h3>

<p><abbr title="Local Authorities">LAs</abbr> will use their knowledge and expertise to provide support for the Participant once they are in employment, tailored to the individual’s needs.</p>

<p>This support can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verbal instruction, prompts and demonstrating using simple language</li>
  <li>Ensuring people have more time to learn</li>
  <li>Use of naturally occurring praise, reinforcement or pay incentives</li>
  <li>Managing work pressure/ productivity demands</li>
  <li>Systematic instruction such as breaking tasks into steps, “chaining” tasks together and developing a hierarchy of cues</li>
  <li>Understanding and using physical guidance and gestures</li>
  <li>Developing ways for work-based accreditation of skills</li>
  <li>Developing peer support and job clubs</li>
  <li>Supporting the Participants’ induction and providing on-site training support if needed</li>
  <li>Offering out of work support if required</li>
  <li>Updating and reviewing the Action Plan to support the Participant’s learning and progress in the workplace on a regular basis</li>
  <li>Activity and targets that include the social inclusion of the worker within the workplace</li>
  <li>Support and guidance for the employer to help them better meet the individual’s needs</li>
  <li>Ongoing support to address any barriers that may be affecting the individual’s progress and participation in the workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>Meeting frequency will be determined by the <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> in agreement with the individual and employer. It may be intensive during the first few weeks with a view to reducing support gradually and in line with the individual’s needs.</p>

<p>The Action Plan must be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and targets should include the social inclusion of the Participant within the workplace.</p>

<p>Participants should be encouraged to increase their working hours and seek progression opportunities and development as appropriate. Where this is not possible with a Participant’s current employer, an additional job would be appropriate. A Participant’s second job should not be recorded as a Job Start. Supported Employment should encourage the career development of individuals by promoting training opportunities and seeking options for increased responsibility.</p>

<p>If it becomes apparent that a job is not suitable, the Participant can leave the job. If they wish to remain on the programme, Stage 2 – Vocational Profiling, Stage 3 – Engaging Employers and/or Stage 4 – Job Matching may be revisited in order to seek a new suitable job for the Participant.</p>
