<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, and is not a substitute for independent legal advice.  Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage, or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. The information contained in this guide is general and factual.  You should contact local lawyers for independent legal advice (<a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-1">see annex 1</a>).</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Italy and who can help.  We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>even if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself, and should do so, particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested.  This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government that requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>British Embassy in Rome: telephone +39 06 4220 0001</p>

<p>British Consulate General in Milan: telephone +39 02 723001</p>

<p>Our working hours are from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday (CET)
You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help.  Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you.  We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions: our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In Italy, notification by the authorities to the Consulate normally takes place within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<h4>We can also:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local English-speaking lawyers and interpreters (<a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-1">Annexes 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Annex-2">2</a>)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including any medication you are taking</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help you apply for a transfer to a prison in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we can’t do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h3>First Steps</h3>

<h4>Can you / will you tell my family?</h4>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.<br>
If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have.  For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h4>Will the UK police be informed?</h4>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police.
It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in Italy.</p>

<h4>Do I need a lawyer? How can I find a lawyer?</h4>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. We can give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers is attached to this pack.  You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h4>Can you get me out?</h4>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British.  However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities.  This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h4>Who else can help me?</h4>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">www.prisonersabroad.org.uk</a> (more information at the end of this pack)</p>

<h2>Detention conditions in Italy</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you are awaiting trial, you must obtain permission from the Preliminary Investigations Judge (GIP- Giudice Indagini Preliminari) in order to receive visits or to make telephone calls to your relatives.</li>
  <li>If you have been sentenced, you must submit a request to the prison director in order to receive visits.</li>
</ul>

<p>All requests for visits must be submitted directly by the prisoner via the prison Registry.  Please refer to your lawyer for further information.</p>

<p>Usually, only blood-relatives are allowed to visit although exceptions can be made at the director’s discretion.  Civil partners might be asked to produce a legal declaration, together with supporting evidence such as telephone bills, joint bank accounts etc. Your lawyer would normally arrange permits for visits, but your family should contact the Embassy or Consulate for advice on how to proceed before travelling.</p>

<p>Family members and third parties are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>spouse</li>
  <li>cohabitant regardless of sex</li>
  <li>relatives within the fourth degree of kinship.</li>
  <li>persons who have reasonable grounds to meet the detainee</li>
</ul>

<p>Prisoners are normally allowed up to six visits per month, although those convicted of particularly serious offences may only be granted a maximum of four visits per month.  Prisoners who are seriously ill, or have visits from children under 10 years of age may be granted additional visits.</p>

<p>A maximum of three people can be present at each visit, although an exception may be possible when relatives or cohabitants are involved.
Visits normally last one hour although if relatives have arrived from abroad a request can be made for an extended visit of 2 to 3 hours, but this decision rests with the prison director. Visiting days and times vary from prison to prison.</p>

<h3>What can visitors expect?</h3>

<p>Visitors will have their identification checked upon arrival and will need to deposit their personal effects. They will walk through a metal detector.<br>
They will need to present the following documentation:</p>

<p>Spouse and family members who are not EU citizens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Valid form of ID</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document issued by the Italian Consulate in the country of origin OR document (translated into Italian) showing the family relationship</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Visits normally take place in dedicated halls under visual monitoring by the prison officers. Vending machines for snacks and drinks are available in most prisons in Italy.</p>

<h3>What can visitors bring?</h3>

<p>Visitors may bring packages containing food, clothing and various items. The total weight should not exceed a monthly allowance of 20 kilos.</p>

<p>A form known as 176 is available from the prison Registry (Ufficio Matricola) listing the items you may receive.  The list may vary from prison to prison, so it is advisable to check with the Ufficio Matricola or the Embassy/Consulate for further information.</p>

<p>It is forbidden to receive and possess goods that, due to their nature or the type of packaging are difficult to control or considered dangerous. Liquids (including toiletries), beverages, tobacco and food in glass, metal or aluminium packaging are not permitted. Military style clothes and hooded garments are not permitted. Some items such as medicine and belts (without buckles) need to be pre-authorised.</p>

<p>Packages are inspected prior to delivery to the recipient and banned items will be removed.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>If you consent to consular assistance, we will aim to contact you as soon as possible after being told about your arrest or detention so that we can assess how we can help you. We will then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions.  Following notification of your arrest, we will submit a request to visit you; however, it could be 5 to 7 days before we receive permission. Due to Covid-19 regulations, we have been carrying out consular visits via video-calls. We can arrange these directly with the prison authorities as soon as we are notified of your arrest.
You can write to us at any time on matters of concern, but if it is urgent, it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Emergency trips outside of prison</h3>

<p>In the event a relative is terminally ill, an emergency visit outside the prison may be granted by the authorities or supervising judge.</p>

<h3>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h3>

<h4>Arrival at the police station &amp; basic rights</h4>

<p>There are three main police forces in Italy who have the authority to detain you: the national police (Polizia), the national gendarmerie (Carabinieri) and a militarised police force responsible for dealing with financial crimes and smuggling (Guardia di Finanza). Upon arrest, you are entitled to be informed in English about why you have been detained.  If necessary this can be done via an interpreter, free of charge, . You must be given a verbal and written notice by the arresting officers of the charges for which you are being held in detention. This notice must be given to you no later than 24 hours after you have been arrested. You have the right to appoint a lawyer to defend you; if you wish to, you may exercise your right not to speak without the presence of a lawyer.</p>

<h4>Appearance at court</h4>

<p>A hearing before a judge to validate your arrest will take place within 96 hours of your arrest. This hearing only considers whether your arrest was carried out lawfully, and does not inform you about what will happen later.
More information about the Italian judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#judicial-system">the ‘Italian judicial system’ section below</a>.</p>

<h4>Initial arrival at the prison</h4>

<p>Prison officers working in the prison Registry (Ufficio Matricola) manage arrivals at prison.  The Ufficio Matricola is the prison office that retains all records relating to the prisoner. This office also manages all day-to-day regulations affecting life in prison, such as nominating a lawyer, forwarding legal documents between the Courts and the prisoner, etc.</p>

<p>Prisoners have the right to inform their family upon initial arrest or if they have been transferred from another facility, once prison and judicial documentary requirements are met.  Prisoners have the right to appoint one or two legal advisers of their own choice. Unless the judicial authority imposes prohibitions (which cannot exceed 5 days) at the moment of the arrest, prisoners have the right to have visits with their legal adviser from the time of their admittance and during the whole prison term, at scheduled times, fixed according to prison rules, after submitting an official request to the Ufficio Matricola.</p>

<p>Prisoners are fully searched and their fingerprints taken. They must deposit their valuables and property, such as money, watches, belts, mobile phone. All prisoners will be handed over a memo (verbale) listing the items deposited. They will also undergo a medical and psychological screening, during which they can mention any personal healthcare problems, addictions or allergies and declare if they are in need of medication. They can also ask not to live with other inmates for reasons of personal safety.</p>

<p>All prisoners will be given a copy of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.giustizia.it/resources/cms/documents/Carta_dei_diritti_inglese.pdf" rel="external">The Charter of Prisoners’ and Internees’ Rights and Duties</a> upon arrival in prison or during their first interview with the prison director or with prison staff. The charter explains how prisoners can exercise their rights and have better knowledge of all rules and regulations relevant to daily life in prison. Handouts are also at disposal in visit halls in each prison facility.</p>

<p>Together with the Charter, prisoners are also given extracts from the Penitentiary Act and enforcement of liberty deprivation and restriction measures and all prisoners will be told where they can find the full texts of the above-mentioned document.</p>

<h3>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>Over-crowding can be a problem in prisons in Italy. The number of inmates to each cell entirely depends on the size of the cell and the number of prisoners in the particular prison.  There are usually 3 to 6 prisoners in a cell. Women’s prisons are separate to men’s.</p>

<p>If you experience serious harassment, threats or violence you should report this to the Embassy/Consulate as soon as possible. It is our responsibility to raise allegations of mistreatment against a British national. However, we will only raise concerns with the prison administration if you request that we do so.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>As in the UK, overcrowding can be a problem within Italian prisons. The prison is not obliged to grant you a single cell nor your request to share a cell with another prisoner.  Usually there are 3 to 6 prisoners in a cell. Most cells have either single beds or metal bunk beds, with a mattress and single sheets. Some cells may have a washbasin or a shower.  All cells have a toilet and a window.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>Prison food is free and prisoners will be given three meals per day (breakfast, lunch and dinner). You should inform the prison authorities if you have special dietary requirements due to health or religion. If you wish to supplement your diet, you will need funds to purchase additional food from the prison shop.  Please ask the Ufficio Matricola to provide a list of available products.  Prisoners should have access to drinking water and to use personal gas cookers in line with safety regulations. Prisoners are entitled to receive food supplies in parcels from outside, within regulations and established limits of weight. A delegation of prisoners shall inspect meal preparation and prices of items sold at the prison shop.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Overcrowding is the cause of and contributing factor in many of the health issues in prisons in Italy, most notably infectious diseases and mental health issues.  The general hygienic conditions inside prisons in Italy can be poor. Showers are mainly in communal areas. Toiletries can be bought from the prison shop.</p>

<p>Prisoners have the right to receive personal underwear, clothing and bedding; they shall take care of them, keep their cells in good order and keep themselves clean. All prisoners can have showers, and shall be provided with periodical hair and beard cuts.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>Upon request, prisoners can participate in work activities, both in their prison facility or outside. The possibility to work outside the prison is assessed depending on the type of sentence being served and availability. The supervisory judge approves the work plan set out by the prison director and lists the obligations and rules that need to be followed. However, it is difficult for the prison to supply work to all prisoners because there are often not enough jobs to go around. This means that you may have to wait some time before finding a suitable job. Please note that the prison authorities are not obliged to offer you a job and that sentenced prisoners will normally have preference over prisoners on remand.  Prisoners will be financially compensated for their work and their wage credited to their prison account.</p>

<p>Not all prisons offer internal training courses, workshops or rehabilitation programmes.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary Italian school courses are available in all prisons. Some rewards are granted to prisoners who have shown commitment and merit in education and vocational training. It is also possible to undertake school learning courses as a private student to get a high school diploma or university degree. Prison facilities usually include a library, which is run in collaboration with some prisoners. Access to the library of each prison wing is scheduled on days and hours established in the prison internal regulations.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>

<p>There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries). Please see below for further information about Prisoners Abroad. Learning Italian will help you to understand what is going on, to communicate your needs and to ease the boredom and mental isolation of prison life. There is also the possibility of funding for education courses through Prisoners Abroad. If you are interested, you should write to them for further information. Courses and workshops in Italian prisons are rare and available only in certain prisons. It is therefore the prisoner’s responsibility to occupy his/her own time during the day. We try to bring or send you English books, magazines or newspapers when we can. Please note that to be able to do so we rely on donations.</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>In prison, cultural, sports and leisure activities are available for the purpose of rehabilitation. To participate in courses and in other prison programmes, you need to submit an application to the prison social worker or to the Ufficio Matricola. During outdoor exercise time, prisoners are allowed to do some physical training.  Some prisons have their own gym. Every prisoner has the right to spend at least two hours outdoors each day or, under specific prison regimes, a shorter period but not less than an hour.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>Italy experiences a Mediterranean climate, which varies considerably depending on which part of the country you are in. Summers are generally hot and humid and cells do not have air conditioning. Winters are wet and cold especially in the North of Italy.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Prisons in Italy recognise and respect the right of prisoners to register and practise their faith whilst in custody. Religious leaders can visit prisoners upon request.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Drugs are prohibited in all prisons in Italy. Severe sanctions will be faced by those caught consuming or in possession. All prisoners are obliged to undergo searches whenever it is necessary for security reasons. Smoking cigarettes is allowed in prison, inside your cell, in designated areas and outdoors. Smoking is banned in communal indoor areas.</p>

<h3>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are two ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends. See below for instructions on how to send funds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The British government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners</p>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a “Prison Comforts” system for money transfers from family and friends to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO or the Embassy or Consulate in order to arrange this.
We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it is possible to send money to a prisoner in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If your relatives live in Italy, they can send a postal order (bollettino postale) addressed to the direction of the institution, indicating the prisoner’s full name in the reason for payment (causale).
The prison direction will then pay the sum into the prisoner’s personal account. In every prison, there is a Current Accounts Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the counter delivery during visits: amounts permitted vary from prison to prison according to internal regulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sending a bank transfer to the bank account of the Direction indicating the IBAN and SWIFT code. In the reason for payment (causale), the family member must write the prisoner’s full name. This option is not available in all prisons.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The British Embassy or Consulate can give you and your family more details on the above payment methods depending on which prison you are in.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources. See Chapter 4 for more details.</p>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, Italy is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. If you need medical attention, you should submit a request to the Ufficio Matricola to see a doctor or a dentist. You should contact the Capo Posto (Duty Officer) after the opening of the cells in the morning and ask for your name to be written in the ledger for a medical visit. Basic medical attention is free of charge.</p>

<p>Private health care is also possible, pending approval by the prison director. Payment for private healthcare is at your own expense.</p>

<p>In some large prisons, it may be difficult to get an early medical appointment. Prison doctors are often the equivalent of GPs in the UK. Unusual or complex problems may be referred to a specialist outside the prison; such treatment might not be free.</p>

<p>Prescription glasses will need to be purchased.</p>

<p>Sometimes medication is not available in prisons. In such instances, you or the prison doctor should contact the Embassy or Consulate.  The cost of prescribed medication has to be covered either by the prisoner or, if a prisoner qualifies, through the Prisoners Abroad medical fund. Further information about Prisoners Abroad will be provided in later pages. If you have a long-standing medical problem and have received treatment for it in the UK, it may be useful to ask your doctor in the UK to send a copy of your records or at least a report directly to you or via the Embassy/Consulate if you prefer.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor.  We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Mail and parcels</h4>

<p>Prisoners have a right to unlimited correspondence (letters) while serving their sentence. Depending on the charges, incoming and outgoing mail may be censored. Mail will be subject to examination and delays are to be expected. 
Friends and family can send mail and parcels directly to the prison. The Embassy/Consulate is not able to forward mail on your behalf back to the UK. All parcels are opened and checked by prison staff before they are handed over to prisoners.  A prisoner can receive 4 postal parcels per month; there is a weight limit of 5 kilos per parcel but this depends on whether a person has received other packages that month, or during ordinary prison visits (please note: a book in a padded envelope would be considered a parcel). Please note that educational material, such as books and magazines do not count towards the weight limit.</p>

<p>Prison regulations state that there must be a delay of 15 days between parcels delivered on visits and parcels received by post.  Please note that excessive parcels are either returned to the sender, at the prisoner’s expense, or kept in the prison’s storeroom. If you have pending parcels, you will receive them following the order of arrival. Please refer to the Ufficio Matricola for more information. Parcels may contain personal goods such as clothes, paperback books etc.  Please request a written copy of goods permitted in your prison from the prison directly.</p>

<p>Prisoners can buy stamps from the prison shop. The British Embassy/Consulate will also send you a self-addressed pre-stamped envelopes for you to write to us.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>In Italy, you do not have an automatic right to make a phone call when you are arrested. If you wish to make a telephone call (including international calls), permission must first be obtained from the judge. Once charges and detention have been confirmed, the prison director has to approve your request, which you should submit in writing enclosing the following documentation: copy of a telephone bill of the number you wish to call; copy of the passport of the owner of the telephone number, document proving your relationship to that person (e.g.: marriage certificate, birth certificates).  Prisoners may be authorised to make telephone calls to relatives and cohabitants and, when there are reasonable and verified reasons, to third parties.</p>

<p>Calls can be made once a week, no longer than ten minutes and in allocated time slots. Contact is made through the institution’s switchboard operator.  Mobile phones are not permitted in prison.</p>

<p>All phone calls are charged to the prisoner, on a call-by-call basis. You’ll be allowed to purchase a phone card. All requests for visits and phone calls shall be submitted to the judicial authority if you are awaiting trial and to the prison director if you have been sentenced.</p>

<h4>Mobile phones</h4>

<p>There are two exceptions where inmates are permitted to call mobile phones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when they have not had any type of visits/contact for at least 15 days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when they have no other possibility of contact with relatives</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to sentencing, all requests to call a mobile phone should be submitted to the competent judicial authority.</p>

<p>After sentencing, the prisoner must apply to the prison director, who will ask the relevant consulate whether the number refers to a landline or a mobile phone. In the latter case, the detainee must produce a copy of the mobile phone contract.</p>

<h4>Calls from outside prison</h4>

<p>Prisoners cannot receive incoming calls.</p>

<h4>Skype</h4>

<p>Some prisons allow the use of Skype. Please check with the Embassy or Consulate for details.</p>

<h4>Video calls via the internet</h4>

<p>In some prisons, video calls are permitted via Skype, Teams and/or WhatsApp to maintain relationships with family members.  Please check with the Embassy or Consulate.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform Consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally accepted standards.</p>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received. Prisoners have the right to not be subjected to any disciplinary measures, which include the use of unreasonable force, intimidation, or threats (such as the use of handcuffs) and can make a complaint to the relevant supervisor. More generally, they can make a complaint to the supervisory judge to assert all rights that are acknowledged by the Penitentiary Act. 
You should report the allegations to your lawyer as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For complaints, prisoners can write to the prison director, the Minister of Justice, the supervisory judge, the Head of State and the Ombudsman.</p>

<p>In the first instance, you should contact the regional Ombudsman for your area (Garante Regionale), in order to receive assistance quicker.  The Consulate can provide you with contact details for your regional Ombudsman.
You can also report your allegations directly to the national Ombudsman (Garante Nazionale), established to protect people in detention through independent monitoring.</p>

<p>You can contact the Garante Nazionale by email or by letter:</p>

<h2>Italian judicial system</h2>

<h3>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>The Italian justice system is very different to the British justice system, and in particular, how the initial investigation into an alleged crime is carried out.  In the UK, the police carry out the initial investigation and then present their findings on the case to the public prosecutor.  In Italy, a public prosecutor is in charge of the initial investigation, working closely with the police.  The initial investigation in Italy is entirely separate from the trial process, with separate magistrates.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the Italian judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h4>What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. A list of local English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.</p>

<p>After your arrest or detention for a suspected crime (arresto or fermo) you can be kept at the police station for up to 24 hours. You must be given verbal and written notice by the arresting officers (police) of the charges for which you are being held in detention. The Public Prosecutor must be notified within 24 hours. Then a hearing to confirm the arrest or detention takes place before a judge within 96 hours. Criminal procedures begin when the public prosecutor’s office is notified of a crime.</p>

<h4>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>The public prosecutor’s office has a maximum of 6 to 12 months (depending on the nature of the crime) to carry out an investigation. If the investigation becomes complex the period for completion of the investigation can be extended to a period between 18 to 24 months. Requests to extend the term for completing the investigation must be approved by a judge. Postponements and delays in the investigations are frequent, resulting very often in difficulties in predicting when they will be concluded.</p>

<p>An arrest and precautionary measures (such as provisional - also called pre-trial - detention) can be adopted in order to prevent the defendant from fleeing, from committing another crime, or from destroying true evidence or creating false evidence.  The judge can adopt this measure only when the prosecutor asks that the defendant’s rights of movement be limited.</p>

<p>The defendant can be remanded in provisional custody for a maximum of 3 months for minor charges but the period increases for a more serious offence. The period restarts and increases for each new stage of the proceedings.</p>

<h3>The judicial process</h3>

<p>The judicial process can be summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>investigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>preliminary hearing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>trial (first level)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>appeal involving a new trial (second level)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Court (third and final level) if certain criteria exist</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>What happens after the preliminary investigation?</h4>

<p>After the investigation has been completed, the procedure may have various outcomes, as described below:</p>

<p>a)	If the public prosecutor determines there is not enough evidence to support the charge(s), they can ask the Preliminary Investigations Judge (GIP - Giudice delle Indagini Preliminari) to dismiss the case. The prosecutor must inform any victims of the crime of the proposal to apply for dismissal of the case, if they have previously requested to be informed. The victims may then, at that time, file an objection to the recommendation to dismiss the case, making a case as to why further investigations should be performed. If the judge considers the victim’s objection to dismissal to be reasonable, the public prosecutor will be instructed to carry out further investigations or to file formal criminal charges against the suspect. If the judge deems there is not enough evidence to support the charge(s), the case is definitively closed.</p>

<p>b)	If the prosecutor determines there is sufficient evidence to support the charge(s), they must notify the defendant, their lawyer and in some cases the victim(s) that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the investigation has been concluded, (aviso di conclusione delle indagini preliminari: notification that the investigation has been concluded)</li>
  <li>the case will move forward to an initial hearing and then trial</li>
</ul>

<p>The victim is notified only for certain charges such as stalking and family abuse.</p>

<p>Once informed that the investigation has been concluded and the case will move forward, the defendant can file a defensive counter brief through their lawyer within twenty days.  This could include details of the results of any defence inquiries, a proposal for the defendant to meet the prosecutor to make statements or offer to answer questions from the prosecutor. The brief can also ask the prosecutor to follow specific lines of investigation.
If the prosecutor determines there is sufficient evidence to support the charge(s), the case is forwarded to the judge in charge of the preliminary hearing (GUP - Giudice dell’Udienza Preliminare) asking for the case to be tried, and specifying the formal charges against the accused (richiesta di rinvio a giudizio). The judge then sets a date for the preliminary hearing (udienza preliminare) in which the accused can defend themselves.  At this hearing, the judge can decide to close the case without proceeding to a trial or order that the case go to trial (rinvio a giudizio) if the charges are not dropped. Preliminary issues are verified and then the trial (dibattimento) begins.</p>

<p>c)	For those crimes which fall under the competence of a single judge or a justice of the peace, the public prosecutor will serve a summons for trial or a direct summons for trial.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>The trial (dibattimento) is before the Courts.  The court will either be a Tribunal court, or a Court of Assizes (Corte d’Assise: a first level court for more serious crimes), depending on the crime (see Annexes).</p>

<p>The trial must be held in public, but you do not need to be present at the hearing.  The judge, however, may decide for particular cases that the trial or part of the trial should be held in private and order your compulsory attendance. Your lawyer must always attend.</p>

<p>You have the right to remain silent for all of the trial.  If you do not understand the language you have the right to have an interpreter, which can be court-appointed and free of charge.</p>

<p>Italian trials can last many months, and have long gaps between hearings.</p>

<h4>Verdict</h4>

<p>Once the trial is over the judge presents the verdict and reads the charges.  The verdict can be either acquittal or conviction.  In case of conviction, the penalty might be either a fine or a prison sentence, or both.
When the verdict is final, which means that no further appeals can be made, it becomes enforceable and it is registered at the Criminal Records Office.</p>

<p>If you are given a prison sentence, which is not suspended, the Public Prosecutor presents an enforceable order.
If you have to serve three years or less in prison, the Public Prosecutor may suspend the sentence and notify you of his decision.</p>

<p>You may apply within 30 days for a different measure other than imprisonment to the Supervisory Court (Tribunale di Sorveglianza). If there are existing preconditions, you may ask to be submitted either to the supervision of a social worker, to be placed under house arrest or under the supervision of a rehabilitation and prevention centre.
If you don’t submit a request or if your application is rejected you must start serving the sentence.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>In Italy, some crimes are punished only with a fine, while others are punished with a fine attached to a detention sentence. Lastly, some crimes are punished only with detention.  If a fine is applied, it is expected to be paid when the trial is closed and the verdict is irreversible. 
When the court requests the payment, the defendant is required to pay.  If they does not, an administrative procedure to obtain the payment is started by the Government. If the defendant has a salary or income, the Government is able to confiscate the amount required to be paid by the fine, depending on the person’s personal circumstances. The defendant can request the payment to be paid in instalments to the magistrate.
If the defendant cannot pay, the magistrate investigates the defendant’s financial situation and, if it is impossible to obtain the payment because the person is financially not able to pay, the fine will be converted into a custodial punishment (in the form of probation) or community service. In this case, each 250 euros of fine is converted into 1 day of probation or 1 day of community service.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>The defendant and the prosecutor can appeal against the verdict before the Corte d’Appello (Court of Appeal, the 2nd level Court) that will retry the defendant. The verdict passed by the Court of Appeal can be appealed against, before the Corte di Cassazione (Court of Cassation, High Court, the 3rd level Court). Both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation must examine and rule on every appeal. They can overturn, amend or review the two previous verdicts. The Court of Cassation ruling is the final verdict.</p>

<p>The prosecutor can appeal all judgements issued by the First Level Court. This means that a not-guilty verdict can be appealed and overturned too. The Court of Appeal can hand down a more serious penalty than the First Level Court.
Only when the defendant alone has appealed the verdict, the Court of Appeal cannot issue a more serious sentence.</p>

<h3>Special Proceedings</h3>

<p>During the preliminary hearing, the defendant or his lawyer may request special proceedings, e.g. summary proceedings (giudizio abbreviato) or plea-bargaining (patteggiamento).</p>

<h4>Summary proceedings</h4>

<p>Summary proceedings (giudizio abbreviato - literally abbreviated, or short, proceedings) consist of opting out of the trial process. In such a case, the Judge presiding over the preliminary hearing will take into consideration the evidence gathered during the preliminary investigations by the prosecutor and by the case put forward by the defence lawyer, and will decide to either convict or acquit the defendant.
The decision to opt out of the formal trial and to accept summary proceedings can only be made by the defendant; since opting out of the trial process is considered a lessening of the defendant’s rights, (he gives up his right to present new evidence and to be tried by a judge at the trial).
In summary proceedings cases, the defendant is rewarded with a reduction in sentence. The law states that this reduction should be one third. 
Both the defendant and the prosecutor can appeal against a summary proceedings judgement before the Court of Appeal (which can rule on the merits of the case, but usually without gathering further evidence) and the case can even go before the High Court (Corte di Cassazione) (which cannot rule on merits, but only on correct procedure and correct interpretation of the law).</p>

<h4>Plea Bargaining</h4>

<p>When the defendant is advised by his/her lawyer that the sentence for the crime is likely to be five years or less, (and there are some crimes which have a maximum sentence of two years), the defendant may plea-bargain (patteggiamento) with the prosecutor. If the proposal is accepted, the defendant is rewarded with a reduction in sentence and does not have to pay the fees for the judicial proceedings. In these cases, the defendant must agree to plead guilty to the charges (even if the plea-bargain sentence has other issues involving other compensation proceedings), no matter how serious they are.</p>

<p>The bargaining is not about the charges, but about the sentence, which is reduced by one third. When both the prosecutor and the defendant have come to an agreement, the plea bargaining proposal is submitted to the judge. He will then consider the evidence and, if he is convinced that the defendant is not guilty, he must not accept the proposal and instead acquit the defendant.  This happens seldom, if ever. If, on the contrary, he deems that the defendant is guilty and he agrees with the punishment, the judge must sanction the proposal. If the judge deems the defendant guilty, but thinks that the proposed punishment is too light, he can refuse to accept the proposal and the proceedings will continue. The defendant can, however, ask the judge to reconsider the proposal.</p>

<p>If a Judge accepts a proposal by the prosecutor and the defendant, the judgment can be appealed only before the High Court, (which can rule only on the correct the interpretation of the law).</p>

<p>Further information on the legal system should be obtained from your lawyer.</p>

<h3>Are there alternative forms of detention in Italy?</h3>

<p>The judge can decide for alternative measures to detention such as home detention or house arrest. The types of restrictions and their implications should be discussed with your lawyer. The Embassy/Consulate can advise regarding residency.</p>

<h4>Home detention</h4>

<p>The Supervisory Court will grant home detention to any inmate aged 70 or over, who has not been declared a habitual or “professional” offender. The same measure can be granted, for a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding four years, even when part of a longer sentence, to a pregnant offender, to imprisoned mothers or fathers of children under the age of ten, to offenders with particularly serious health conditions or aged over 60 (if disabled) or under 21, and to inmates who are serving a sentence or residual prison sentence not exceeding two years.</p>

<h4>Custodial sentences at the inmate’s home</h4>

<p>In addition to the above measures, the law provides that a custodial sentence not exceeding eighteen months even if part of a longer sentence, can be served at the inmate’s personal domicile or at a different address. This measure is not applicable to offenders who have committed serious crimes as listed in the Penitentiary Act, eg, terrorism, mafia association, slavery and human trafficking, abduction, drug trafficking.  This measure can be granted to imprisoned mothers with children aged under 10, when one-third of the sentence has been served (15 years if she has been sentenced to life imprisonment), and when it is possible to restore cohabitation with her children.</p>

<h4>Semi-liberty</h4>

<p>This allows convicted persons to spend part of the day outside prison to attend work or education or any other activity useful to their rehabilitation into society. It is granted by the Supervisory Court to any inmate who is: 
* under sentence of arrest or imprisonment not exceeding six months; 
* serving a sentence over 6 months and has served at least half of his/her sentence (two-thirds of it for certain serious crimes listed in the Penitentiary Act)
* sentenced to life imprisonment and has served 26 years in prison.</p>

<h4>Conditional release</h4>

<p>This can be granted to any inmate who has served at least 30 months (or half) of their sentence when the residual sentence does not exceed 5 years.  If a repeat offender they must have served at least 4 years and no less than three quarters of the sentence.  If a person is sentenced to life imprisonment, 26 years must already have been served. 
To be granted conditional release, inmates must have maintained good behaviour and shown rehabilitation during their time in prison. It is also subject to a prisoner fulfilling the civic commitments relevant to their crime unless this is shown to be impossible.</p>

<h4>Suspension of undertaking the sentence for drug addicts or alcoholics</h4>

<p>The Supervisory Court can suspend the sentence being carried out for a period of five years for inmates who have to serve a sentence or a residual prison sentence of up to 6 years (four years for certain crimes), if crimes are committed following drug/alcohol addiction, and have succeeded in therapeutic and social rehabilitation programmes in a public or authorized-by-law health facility.</p>

<h3>Special prison regimes</h3>

<h4>Regime of special surveillance</h4>

<p>The ‘regime of special surveillance’ can be ordered by the Department of Penitentiary Administration (following a proposal by themselves or by the prison governor or the judicial authority, with recommendation by the disciplinary board), in relation to repeated offensive behaviours against prison order and security. This will mean specific restrictions on work and leisure, on correspondence and phone calls, on the possession of specific items that are normally accepted. Limitations cannot be applied to the inmate’s personal care or health needs, food, clothing and bedding, books and magazines, religious practices, use of authorized radio devices, outdoor exercise for at least one hour a day, meetings with legal adviser, visits from spouse, live-in partner, children, parents and brothers and sisters. A complaint can be made against the Department of Penitentiary Administration and addressed, within ten days, to the Supervisory Court (Tribunale del Riesame)</p>

<h4>Regime for people sentenced for particular crimes</h4>

<p>All inmates and internees imprisoned for any serious crimes as listed in the Penitentiary Act can be granted no more than four visits and two phone calls each month, and are subjected to restrictions in the granting of benefits such as the assignment to work outside prison and sports and cultural activities, bonus leave and alternative measures and sanctions.</p>

<h4>Continued isolation</h4>

<p>This is allowed for health reasons in cases of contagious disease; exclusion from activities and prohibition of contact with other inmates can be ordered, if this is considered necessary by the judicial authority. Daily meals, water and medical check-ups are allowed. During isolation, any inmate can receive visits from political, judicial, administrative and religious authorities.</p>

<h4>Temporary suspension of ordinary rules of prison treatment</h4>

<p>The Minister of Justice, in exceptional cases of prison riots or other serious emergency situations, can suspend the ordinary rules on the treatment of prisoners and internees, in the prison concerned or in a part of it. This suspension will aim to restore order and security and its duration will be strictly limited to the achievement of these goals. The Minister of Justice can also fully or partly suspend the ordinary rules on the treatment of inmates and internees imprisoned for any crimes with terrorist aims or against democratic order and security, for mafia-type crimes and, when there is evidence of existing links with a criminal, terrorist or subversive organisation. This suspension imposes limits necessary to prevent contacts with other criminal organisations (one single visit per month and only with relatives and live-in partners; visits are recorded and filmed unless they are with legal advisers; limitations on money and parcels from outside the prison; exclusion from any delegation; all correspondence being censored; restricted time for outdoor exercise). It is applied for a period of four years, which can be extended, two years at a time. Prisoners subjected to this special regime will be imprisoned in facilities or special wings, exclusively dedicated to them, separated from the inmates’ community, where custody is the responsibility of the penitentiary police special units. Complaints against the Minister of Justice’s order in this regard can be made to the Supervisory Court of Rome within ten days from the notification to the inmate.</p>

<h4>In prison before, during and after childbirth</h4>

<p>Pre-trial custody cannot be ordered, or continued, for pregnant prisoners or mothers with children aged up to six years, unless there are exceptionally relevant precautionary measures. The sentence is postponed if the offender is pregnant or the mother of children below the age of three.   Convicted female prisoners may request to raise their children outside of prison if they are below the age of ten.  Prisoners who are pregnant and are required to be detained for specific reasons are granted adequate care by specialized doctors, midwives and paediatricians and are allocated dedicated prison units.</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within Italy possible?</h4>

<p>Applications for transfer to another establishment should be sent, through the prison governor, to the Regional Director of the Penitentiary Administration, when the transfer is requested to a prison within the same district.   When the transfer is to a facility in a different district the application should be sent to the Department of Penitentiary Administration of the Ministry of Justice. The authorities prefer to transfer inmates to structures close to their family’s residence. This is usually not the case for British nationals, if family normally resides in the UK.
All prisoners can be transferred for serious and substantiated security reasons, for reasons relevant to the prison institution and for reasons of justice. Unfortunately, the British Embassy/Consulate cannot intervene in prison transfers within Italy.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>Bail does not exist under Italian law.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>British nationals serving prison sentences in Italy can apply to transfer to a UK prison and serve their sentence in the UK, under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.
Please contact the British Embassy / Consulate for more information.
You should write to your lawyer and to the Prison authorities in the first instance to request transfer to the UK.  You should also inform the Embassy / Consulate that you have done so.
To transfer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be a British citizen or have close family ties with the UK (normally through permanent residence in the UK)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not be awaiting trial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have exhausted all appeals against your conviction and/or the length of your sentence; or have waived your right to an appeal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have at least 6 months of your sentence left to serve when you apply for transfer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have no outstanding fines or other non-custodial penalties</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The offence you were convicted for must also be a criminal offence in the part of the UK you wish to be transferred to: England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. 
The authorities in the sentencing country may refuse your request. You should be aware that even if the sentencing State agrees to your transfer then the UK authorities may also refuse your request. Reasons for this might include if you have not lived in the UK for a number of years and you have no close family residents there.</p>

<h3>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h4>

<p>Once you have been arrested, if you do not name a lawyer, one is automatically appointed by the state to assist you. Legal expenses are charged to the defendant.
If you wish to hire a lawyer, a list of English-speaking lawyers is provided at the end of this pack.  Prisoners Abroad can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer. Normally if you employ a lawyer privately, he will ask for a large advance on his estimated legal fees (which may be high) before he will take on your case. The Embassy/Consulate cannot pay legal fees or guarantee to a lawyer that you will pay him/her.</p>

<p>Legal aid (patrocinio gratuito) may be available at any stage of the judicial process in criminal cases. A defendant may submit a request to the judge to authorise the State to pay his/her lawyer, but only if he/she can prove earnings of less than €11,746.68  per year (updated figure for 2021 – this figure is updated every two years by the Italian government). The earnings of anyone living with the defendant are also taken into account.  It is quite a complicated procedure so we invite prisoners to consult their lawyer in the first instance. Please be aware that legal aid lawyers rarely speak English and their ability varies.</p>

<h4>What happens at the trial?</h4>

<p>The trial (dibattimento) is before the Courts – either a Tribunal or a Court of Assizes (Corte d’Assise, a first level court that tries more serious crimes), depending on the crime (see Annexes).
The trial is held in public, but you do not need to be present at the hearing. The judge, however, may decide for particular cases that the trial or part of the trial should be held in private and order your compulsory attendance. Your lawyer must always attend. 
You have the right to remain silent for the duration of the trial.
If you do not understand Italian, you have the right to have an interpreter (court-appointed, free of charge).
Italian trials can last many months, and have long gaps between hearings.</p>

<h4>Verdict</h4>

<p>Once the trial is over the judge presents the verdict (sentenza) and reads the charges.  The verdict can be either acquittal or conviction.</p>

<p>In case of conviction the penalty might be either a fine or a prison sentence or both.</p>

<p>When the verdict is final (i.e. no further appeals can be made) it becomes enforceable and it is registered at the Criminal Records Office.  If you are given a prison sentence, which is not suspended, the Public Prosecutor presents an enforceable order.  If you have to serve three years or less in prison, the Public Prosecutor may suspend the sentence and notify you of his decision.</p>

<p>You may apply within 30 days for a different measure rather than imprisonment to the “Tribunale di Sorveglianza”. If there are existing preconditions, you may ask to be submitted either to the supervision of a social worker, to be placed under house arrest or under the supervision of a rehabilitation and prevention centre.</p>

<p>If you don’t submit your request or if your application is rejected you must start serving the sentence.</p>

<h4>How can appeals be made?</h4>

<p>The defendant and the prosecutor can appeal against the judgement before the Corte d’Appello (Court of Appeal, the 2nd level Court) that will retry the defendant. The judgement passed by the Court of Appeal can be appealed against, before the Corte di Cassazione (Court of Cassation, High Court, the 3rd level Court). Both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation must examine and rule on every appeal. They can overturn, amend or review the two previous judgments. The Court of Cassation ruling is the final judgment.</p>

<p>The prosecutor can appeal all judgements issued by the First Level Court. This means that a not-guilty verdict can be appealed and overturned too. The Court of Appeal can hand down a more serious penalty than the First Level Court.
Only when the defendant alone has appealed the judgement, the Court of Appeal cannot issue a more serious sentence.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>As a general rule all prisoners and internees who have demonstrated a particular sense of responsibility in work activities, educational courses, in supporting others or in praiseworthy actions, are rewarded with the proposal – formulated by the disciplinary board – for their pardon, conditional release, early repeal of a security measure or other benefits.</p>

<h4>Leave</h4>

<p>An integral part of the rehabilitation programme as it allows the prisoner to nurture affective, cultural and work interests. 
The supervisory judge can grant bonus leave to convicted people who are not considered a danger to society, when they have maintained good behaviour and have served a large part of their sentence. Each leave period cannot exceed 15 days’ duration, and cannot be granted for more than a total of 45 days in a year. When a relative or a live-in partner is nearing death, the judicial authority or the supervisory judge can grant all remand and convicted prisoners and internees leave to visit the sick person. At the leave expiry time, inmates not returning to prison with unjustifiable reasons will undergo disciplinary sanctions, if their absence is within three to twelve hours; in all other cases, the inmates will be charged with escape. When leave is denied, the prisoner has a short time within which to lodge a complaint.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>The supervisory judge can grant early release to convicted persons for good behaviour (buona condotta), that is, a reduction of 45 days of imprisonment for each six months of sentence served. Early release is granted only to those who have regularly behaved well and have shown participation in observation and treatment activities. In calculating the six months of sentence served, all time spent in pre-trial custody or in home detention will also be taken into account. Early release can be granted, under similar limitations and conditions, also to inmates who are assigned to the Probation service. If the supervisory judge rejects the application for early release, a motivated complaint can be made to the Supervisory Court within ten days from the rejection notification.</p>

<h4>Offender’s assignment to the Probation Service</h4>

<p>If a sentence, or residual prison sentence, does not exceed three years, sentenced offenders, on the basis of the results of their character evaluation, may be assigned to the Probation Service, for the period of sentence still to be served, during which they will be under the responsibility of the local probation services under semi detention, home arrest or monitored liberty regime. Prisoners’ applications for this measure must be submitted to the supervisory judge and the Supervisory Court can grant it. The same Court, after having verified that the measure has been successfully fulfilled, shall declare the prison sentence fully served and any other penal measure expired. Drug-addicts or alcoholics, with a sentence or residual prison sentence not exceeding six years (four years for particular categories of crime), who are following a rehab programme, or are willing to start a new one (agreed with local health service for drug-addicts) can be granted a therapeutic assignment. This measure cannot be granted more than twice.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>In Italy, the President of the Republic may “grant pardons, or commute punishments” according to the Italian Constitution. Like other acts of the President, the pardon requires the countersignature of the competent Government minister. 
The pardon may remove the punishment altogether or change its form. Unless the decree of pardon states otherwise, the pardon does not remove any incidental effects of a criminal conviction, such as a mention in a certificate of conduct.
According to the Italian Constitution Parliament may vote to grant amnesty and pardon.</p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>A convicted foreign person may be deported at the end of their sentence, if the judge considers them socially dangerous.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings, Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, the Prisoners Abroad Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making appointments with doctors and dentists</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<p>Release on full completion of sentence will usually be unconditional, unless specified otherwise at the time of the trial, and the prisoner will be free to remain in Italy or return to the UK as long as he/she is not subject to an expulsion order.</p>

<p>Consular Officers would be grateful if the prisoner or his/her family could let the British Embassy/Consulate know when he/she is released or expelled, as it would help keep Consular records up to date.</p>

<p>Upon release, all properties and money on a personal prison account will be given back to the inmate.</p>

<h4>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this will appear if a prospective employer carried out a Criminal Records Bureau check.</p>
