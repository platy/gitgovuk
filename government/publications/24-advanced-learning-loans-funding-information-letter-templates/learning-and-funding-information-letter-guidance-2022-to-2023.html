<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Before applying for an advanced learner loan (ALL), learners must speak to you, as a college or training organisation in receipt of a loans facility from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), to establish the availability of a place on an appropriate course.</p>

<p>The learning and funding information letter is an essential stage in the prospective learners journey. The learner will use it as they consider investing in further education at levels 3 to 6 with a loan. You must issue the letter as part of your discussion with learners when they are considering their education and training and funding options. You must also make learners aware of the loans information available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">National Careers Service website</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Supporting the learner</h2>

<p>You must make all learners, including those learners who are considering funding their course through a loan, aware of your policy on fees and charging. You must do this <strong>before</strong> they decide on their payment method.</p>

<p>You must either attach a copy of your fee policy to the learning and funding information letter or, include a link to your fee policy on your website within the letter.</p>

<p>The availability of loans for learners at level 3 does not replace their entitlement to full funding for a first full level 3. You should check a learners entitlement before you provide information on ALL. More information on eligibility and offers available can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2022-to-2023">adult education budget</a> funding rules and on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The learning and funding information letter gives learners the information necessary to help them consider their options for financing their course. It is important that learners are fully informed and do not feel pressured to apply for a loan.</p>

<p>It also gives the essential information they need to complete an application, should they decide to apply for a loan. It will help to produce accurate applications, ensuring a swift application and assessment process.</p>

<h2>Benefits for colleges and training organisations</h2>

<p>The learning and funding information letter can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support your management of learners’ places, particularly when considering the capacity within the agreed loans facility</li>
  <li>place some distance between you and the learners funding choice giving the learner time to consider their options</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning and funding information letter</h2>

<h3>How to create</h3>

<p>To enable learners to consider their options and equip them with the necessary information to make an application for a loan, if they decide to proceed, you must retain the format and order as set out in this guidance and the template letter.</p>

<p>You can download the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1069889/Learning_and_funding_letter_2022_to_2023.docx" rel="external">annex A</a> letter template on GOV.UK. You can populate the template and send it to your learners. Alternatively, you may want to revise the letter to include specific information about the course offer, alternative payment options and so on. However, you must not change any of the text or the order of the information in the tables, as this is designed to be consistent with the data fields as they appear on the loans application form.</p>

<h3>Information to include</h3>

<p>Tables 1 and 2 provide you with the specific definition and requirements of the information you will need to populate the letter.</p>
