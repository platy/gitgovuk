<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>The Public Duty Costs Allowance (<abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr>) was arranged by the then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robin Butler, in the wake of Margaret Thatcher’s resignation and was announced by the then Prime Minister, John Major, in March 1991.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr> was introduced to assist former Prime Ministers still active in public life. Payments are made only to meet the actual cost of continuing to fulfil public duties.</p>

<p>The costs are a reimbursement of incurred expenses for necessary office costs and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life. The allowance is not paid to support private or parliamentary duties. The <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr> is in addition to any constituency office which they may maintain as a Member of Parliament. The <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr> allowance is paid from the Cabinet Office vote and administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>All former Prime Ministers’ are eligible to draw on the <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr>. They cannot claim the allowance if they are serving as Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>If the former Prime Minister accepts any public appointment, the level of the allowance will be reviewed in relation to the remuneration, if any, which he or she will receive from public funds.</p>

<h2>The allowance</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr> has a financial limit which was originally set to align with the staffing allowance for MPs’ offices. The current limit is set at £115,000 and has remained frozen since 2011. It will remain frozen at this level in 2022-23 and annually. The level of the limit will be reviewed by the Prime Minister at the start of a Parliament.</p>

<p>In addition to the allowance paid, former Prime Ministers are entitled to claim a pension allowance to contribute towards their staff pension costs. This is limited to a maximum of 10% of the allowance.</p>

<p>The core allowance and pension allowance will not be carried over multiple years and all accrued costs should be settled in full by the end of Quarter 1 of the year immediately following the year being claimed.</p>

<h2>Reimbursement of costs and pension allowance</h2>

<p>Former Prime Ministers or their staff may only be reimbursed for legitimate salary or office expenses incurred in meeting the demands of the former Prime Minister’s public life up to the annual limit.</p>

<p>Copies of all supporting documentation e.g. salary details, receipts/travel cards for the former Prime Minister, or any of their staff, should be made available on request by either Cabinet Office Finance or the National Audit Office for audit purposes. The documents are not retained by the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>A purchase order should be requested at the start of the period of any claim and invoices submitted against this purchase order. Frequency of invoices can be decided by the office of the former Prime Minister. Cabinet Office should be notified of total costs to be claimed by the 31st March of the claim year.</p>

<p>The allowance cannot be paid in advance of need.</p>

<p>Cabinet Office will not backdate the core or pension allowance to previous financial years.</p>

<h2>Death of a Claimant</h2>

<p>Staff salaries will continue to be paid for the 3 months following the death of the former Prime Minister. During this time legitimate office expenses incurred in winding-up the former Prime Minister’s office will be met in addition.</p>

<p>Redundancy payments to the former Prime Minister’s staff must be covered within the cap.</p>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<p>The annual amount received by each <abbr title="Public Duty Costs Allowance">PDCA</abbr> claimant is published each year in the Cabinet Office Annual Report and Accounts.</p>
