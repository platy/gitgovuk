<h2>Key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you. However, we cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer. Information about who we can help, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals, is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad</a>.</p>

<p>This information pack aims to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in Ethiopia and who can help. Consular staff can provide a printed copy to those in prison or in custody.</p>

<p>We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Embassy (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>if they do not ask, you can make the request yourself. You should do this if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British embassy, high commission or consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British embassy, high commission or consulate even if you do not want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in the UK, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

British Embassy Addis Ababa
<br>Comoros Street  
<br>P.O.Box 858  
<br>Addis Ababa.  
<br>Email: Consular.addis@fcdo.gov.uk
<br>Telephone: +251 (0)11 617 0100
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on +44 (0)20 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. When we are notified of your arrest or detention, we will aim to contact you as soon as possible, so that we can assess how we can help you. We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions. Our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>When a British national is arrested and detained in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian authorities should inform the British Embassy if the detainee requests this. However, we often learn of an arrest informally from friends or family, or other British national detainees.</p>

<p>Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a list of local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?country=ethiopia&amp;serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">English-speaking lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ethiopia-translators-and-interpreters">interpreters</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions, and the local legal system</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges, and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you, either by visiting or by telephone/letter. The frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances we may be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services are not available we can also try to pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we cannot do</h3>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment because you are British</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs because you have been arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<h3>Informing family members</h3>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and provide them with information about how to contact you. With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider what the impact of not doing so might be. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h3>Informing the UK police</h3>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. Information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances when information about you may need to be shared with authorities in Ethiopia.</p>

<h3>Legal assistance: lawyers</h3>

<p>We cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime. However, we can provide information about the local legal system. We can also give you a list of local interpreters and a list of local English-speaking lawyers. You should consider the benefits of local legal representation and discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. We cannot pay your legal or interpretation costs in any circumstance.</p>

<h3>Consular assistance: fair treatment</h3>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, or get you special treatment because you are British. If you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards, we will consider whether to approach the local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h3>Other organisations that can provide assistance</h3>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>Detention conditions in Ethiopia</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Who can visit and how to arrange visits</h4>

<p>The position of the prison authorities in Ethiopia is that prisoners have the right to communicate with their spouses, close relatives, friends, medical doctors, legal counsellors and religious leaders. The FCDO can advise you on the process for arranging a visit.</p>

<h4>What to expect when you visit</h4>

<p>All visitors will be searched before entry to the prison compound. Prison guards may stand nearby during visits and listen-in to conversations. A meeting room may sometimes be arranged by the prison administration for foreign visitors (i.e. those residing outside of Ethiopia).</p>

<h4>What you can take on your visit</h4>

<p>Regulations about permitted items are the same in every prison but the rules frequently change. Generally, computer equipment, non-fiction literature and telephones are not permitted. Local Families (i.e. those resident in Ethiopia) are usually permitted to bring food. Families residing outside Ethiopia should contact the FCDO in advance of any proposed visit for updated information.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>We aim to visit you every 3 months. During our routine visits you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, security concerns, your treatment in prison, and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our consular staff.</p>

<p>At each consular visit, our staff will complete a “Visit Report Form”. If there is any information that you would prefer not to disclose to a Next of Kin you should let us know during the visit.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:consular.addis@fcdo.gov.uk">consular.addis@fcdo.gov.uk</a> but if it is urgent it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Emergency trips outside of prison</h3>

<p>In exceptional circumstances it may be possible to make a trip outside of the prison (e.g. to attend a local funeral). Permission for these trips is at the discretion of the prison authorities.</p>

<h2>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h2>

<h3>Arriving at the police station: your basic rights</h3>

<p>At the time of your arrest you should be made aware of your rights; this includes being permitted a phone call to speak to a family member. You should inform the authorities if you would like the British Embassy to be informed of your arrest.</p>

<p>Police are not obliged to caution you before questioning, but should inform you that you have the right to remain silent or not to respond to certain questions.</p>

<p>Officers are expected to establish the identity and address of the suspect and inform them of the reason for their arrest. Interviews and statement taking should be conducted with the aid of a translator or English speaking officer where necessary. It is normal for interviews to be recorded by hand but the officer should read to you what he/she has written before asking you to sign the transcript. This may be written in the local language. You can request that the document be translated if the officer does not speak English.</p>

<h3>Appearing at court</h3>

<p>Further information can be found in ‘The Ethiopia judicial system’ section.</p>

<h3>Initial arrival at the prison</h3>

<p>Any belongings that are not part of the investigation will be sent to the prison, if the prison has enough space to keep them. Prisoners are allowed to keep and use their own clothing.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf. The only items we can keep for you are your passport and driver’s license. However, these are usually retained by the courts until the end of your sentence. Please note that your passport might also be kept by the courts as evidence of the alleged crime or as a condition for your bail/parole.</p>

<p>Prisoners are expected to inform the prison authorities if they rely on any medications</p>

<h2>Prison: conditions and daily life</h2>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>

<p>Overcrowding is a problem so you cannot expect a single cell as a matter of course. Sometimes not even a mattress will be available to you. Unfortunately, the Embassy is not allowed to buy new mattresses; you will need to wait until the prison provides you with one. You should also be aware that sanitary conditions (toilets and showers) are extremely poor in Ethiopian prisons.</p>

<h3>Food and diet</h3>

<p>Kality Prison (the main prison used for foreign detainees) provides food items to foreign prisoners to prepare their own meals. These items may not contain adequate nutrition but foreign prisoners can supplement their dietary needs by buying food items (or having them brought in by visitors).</p>

<h3>Hygiene</h3>

<p>Most Ethiopian prisons will provide basic toiletries. Where available, items can also be purchased from the prison shop. Supply varies from one prison to another and some prisons do not have shops. If you need something in particular, ask whether one of your visitors can provide it.</p>

<h3>Work and study</h3>

<p>In the main prison (Kality) there is are no opportunities to work or study for foreign prisoners.</p>

<h3>Contact and languages</h3>

<p>The main prison (Kality) working language is Amharic. Regional prisons use their regional languages. The prison guards may speak local languages or broken English.</p>

<p>Prisoners are allowed to have books, writing materials, and stationary brought by family, friends, and relatives after mandatory checks by the prison administration.</p>

<p>It is possible to request local language materials through the British Embassy from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Prisoners are permitted to go outdoors for Exercise. There are limited exercise facilitates in the main prison.</p>

<h3>Climate</h3>

<p>June to August is the rainy season and can be cold. Prisoners are allowed to use their own clothing.</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>There is a broad tolerance and respect of religious diversity in Ethiopia. This is also the case in prisons. Article 21 of the Ethiopian constitution states that all persons shall have the opportunity to communicate with, and to be visited by their religious councilors.</p>

<h3>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h3>

<p>The use of drugs except approved medication is prohibited. Prisoners found using/in possession of illegal drugs face stiff punishments.</p>

<h2>Prison: access to help and services</h2>

<h3>Receiving money</h3>

<p>There are 2 ways you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison:</p>

<ul>
  <li>private funds: deposited to you by your family or friends</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>: depending on where you are detained, if your family cannot support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>

<h3>Private funds</h3>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family or friends.</p>

<p>The FCDO operates a ‘Prison Comfort’ system for money transfers to prisoners. Ask your family or friends to get in touch with the FCDO to arrange this.</p>

<p>We cannot receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<p>Money received from the UK will be converted into local currency and held on your behalf by our Embassy. Our Consular staff will then transfer your funds to you. Once the money is transferred to you the prison administration expects you to deposit the money with the Prison Accounts Department to avoid theft. Prisoners are allowed to withdraw money Monday to Friday by submitting an application to the Prison Accounts Department.</p>

<p>There is a banking service at Katily prison for prisoners who wish to receive money directly from family members. Prisoners will need to open a local bank account in order to use this service.</p>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not receiving regular donations from other sources.</p>

<h3>Medical and dental treatment</h3>

<p>While you are in detention in Ethiopia, the prison authorities are responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met.</p>

<p>If you need medical or dental treatment you should first report this to the prison authorities.</p>

<p>In the main prison (Kality), the prison Health Officers usually visit cellblocks once per week. If the Health Officers consider that you should see a doctor, they will refer you to the prison hospital. If your medical condition cannot be resolved by the prison hospital, they will consider referral to an external hospital. Referral to an external hospital can only be authorised by the Medical Director or the Doctors at the Prison.</p>

<p>In the main prison (Kality), there is also a visit every Saturday by an external specialist, for prisoners who have a serious illness.</p>

<p>The arrangement of external referral appointments is dependent on the availability of appropriate transport.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also contact your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records.</p>

<h3>Letters and parcels</h3>

<p>Prisoners are permitted to receive letters and parcels. All letters sent to prisoners via the Embassy are opened to check for prohibited items, but Embassy staff will not read the contents. If you are told you are not allowed to receive letters in English, you should notify a Consular Officer and we will liaise with the Prison administration about this matter. Parcels should be sent directly to the prison and the details of the sender must by written on the outside of the package.</p>

<p>Prisoners can also send letters and parcels from prison but will need to purchase the necessary postage stamps. The Embassy cannot send items for you. Please be aware that the prison authorities might read or censor outgoing letters.</p>

<p>Our consular staff will reply to your written correspondence within our target of 20 working days (excluding postage time), but only if your correspondence is of what we consider to be a “serious nature”, e.g. if you have a serious health issue for which you need our help or if you have serious concerns for your safety. Please raise any issues with us during consular visits or ask the prison administration to contact the Embassy as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Prisoners can receive messages from friends and relatives via our central email box: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Consular.Addis@fcdo.gov.uk%20">Consular.Addis@fcdo.gov.uk</a> . The full name of the prisoner and the prison where they are detained should be included in the subject line. We can also send email messages to family and friends on behalf of prisoners.</p>

<h3>Telephone calls</h3>

<p>All prisoners are permitted to make telephone calls to family and friends. Phone cards can be purchased directly from the prison shop. However, phones are frequently out of service. Prisoners and visitors are not permitted to have mobile phones.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint about mistreatment</h3>

<p>If you have been mistreated, you should inform consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and explain any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider. With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible take photos of your injuries.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can approach the prison authorities/administration department to report a compliant.</p>

<h2>The Ethiopia judicial system</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Ethiopian Judicial System and the UK Judicial System have some similarities. For example, prisoners are presumed innocent until proven guilty; they have a right to legal representation, interpreter, fair trial and appeal.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<h4>What should happen after you are arrested</h4>

<p>You will be taken to a detention facility or police station; for further information on what happens following an initial arrest see under ‘Detention conditions in Ethiopia’.</p>

<p>If you have any questions on the legal aspects of your arrest, you should contact your lawyer. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?country=ethiopia&amp;serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">our list of lawyers in Ethiopia</a>.</p>

<h4>How long you can be remanded in custody</h4>

<p>Before trial and during the ongoing investigation, you may be remanded in police custody. One remand period constitutes 14 days. Although there are no limits to the length you may stay in custody, the police are required to report to the court and seek approval for a further remand period every 14 days. The court may order the police to seek remand permission in a period less than every 14 day, depending on the stage of the investigation of your case. In practice, the average remand period is 3-4 months. Remand periods for crimes relating to terrorism last for 28 days.</p>

<h4>Prisoners on remand and sentenced prisoners: differences</h4>

<p>Sentenced prisoners and prisoners on remand are kept in the same prisons.</p>

<h4>After you are charged</h4>

<p>The court will send you details of the charges against you and a summons. On the trial date, the court will reconfirm your identity then read out the charges. They will then ask you if you have any objections to the charges, if not you will be asked if you plead guilty or not guilty. If you plead not guilty the court will call for the public prosecutor to present his evidence. If the evidence of the prosecutor is not strong enough you will be released but if the evidence indicates that you have committed the crime for which you have been accused, you will be given the chance to defend yourself by producing your evidence. If you do not have any evidence to produce or your evidence is considered weak and not acceptable in rebuttal of the evidence produced by the prosecutor, you will be convicted and a sentence will follow.</p>

<h4>Bail</h4>

<p>The Ethiopian Constitution recognises the rights of arrested persons to be released on bail. However, there are exceptions to this rule and the court may deny bail or demand adequate guarantees for the conditional release of the arrested person.</p>

<p>The FCDO cannot transfer bail funds.</p>

<h3>Trial and legal assistance</h3>

<h4>Legal assistance: lawyers and legal aid</h4>

<p>If you wish to hire a private lawyer you may want to consider consulting our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?country=ethiopia&amp;serviceType=lawyers" rel="external">list of English –speaking lawyers</a> in Ethiopia. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>Private lawyers may ask you for a cash advance for their estimated legal fees before taking on a case. If you do not have sufficient funds available you may wish to consider asking a friend or relative to transfer these to you (see Annex A on page 24 for further information on how to do this).</p>

<p>Article 20 (5) of the Ethiopian Constitution recognises the rights of an accused person to be represented by a “legal counsel of their choice, and, if they do not have sufficient means to pay and a miscarriage of justice would result, to be provided with legal representation at state expense”. However, in reality the government will assign defense counsel only for serious cases which entail capital punishment. The Charities and Societies Proclamation prevents Civil Society Organisations from providing free legal aid services.</p>

<h4>Trial</h4>

<p>On your trial day you will be taken to the court office where your case is being handled. There will be a judge in charge of your case along with the public prosecutor and your lawyer or a Public Defender (subject to the severity of the case outlined above). If you don’t speak the local language used in the court, the court will be responsible for hiring an interpreter to assist you during the trial.</p>

<h4>Sentences</h4>

<p>Sentences vary greatly in Ethiopia and will depend on the seriousness of the crime and whether it is a State or Federal crime. Your lawyer/public defender will be best placed to advice on length of sentences and on the appeals‟ processes.</p>

<h4>Appeals</h4>

<p>You have the right to appeal against your sentence in the Higher Courts through your lawyer or if applicable, Public Defender. It is usual for appeals to be made against a first sentence.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>Early release</h4>

<p>The Criminal Law provides that if a prisoner of good character has served two-thirds of a sentence of imprisonment or twenty years in the case of life imprisonment, the Court may, on the recommendation of the management of the institution or on the petition of the prisoner, order conditional release. You should speak to your lawyer about opportunities for parole and whether you may qualify.</p>

<h4>Clemency or pardon</h4>

<p>A sentence may be remitted in whole or in part or commuted into a penalty of a lesser nature or gravity by an act of pardon by the competent authority. You should speak to your lawyer about opportunities for pardon and whether you may qualify.</p>

<h4>Amnesty</h4>

<p>An amnesty may be granted in respect to certain crimes, either absolute amnesty or subject to certain conditions/obligations. You should speak to your lawyer about opportunities for amnesty and whether you many qualify.</p>

<h4>Financial penalties</h4>

<p>Normally prisoners are expected to pay any financial penalties attached to prison sentences imposed before they finish their sentence.</p>

<h4>Transfer to another prison within Ethiopia</h4>

<p>Prison transfer within Ethiopia is not normally available to foreign prisoners.</p>

<h4>Transfer to a prison in the UK</h4>

<p>There is no a prison transfer agreement between the Ethiopian and UK Governments.</p>

<h3>Release and deportation</h3>

<p>If you have an expulsion order issued against you, you will be transferred from the prison to the main immigration office, for expulsion from the country. If unable to provide a valid travel document, ticket and visa or visa fee, you may be detained in one of the immigration police stations, until you are able to resolve these issues. In parallel the main immigration office should inform the British Embassy so that we may assist with travel documentation. The British Embassy cannot pay visa fines or provide free tickets home.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. You may not have lived in the UK before and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, you can visit them when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance you should tell your consular caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need. If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<h3>Your criminal record in the UK</h3>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<h3>Prisoners Abroad</h3>

<p>Since 1978 the charity <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> has offered practical support and advice to British citizens imprisoned abroad. It is the only UK charity providing this service. It is available to all, whether guilty or innocent, convicted or awaiting charge or trial. Prisoners Abroad supports your health and welfare during your imprisonment. It can also provide support on your return to the UK, through their resettlement service (if you have registered whilst in prison). They can also provide support and advice to your family when you are in prison. To access any services, you must first register with Prisoners Abroad by signing and returning their authorisation form.</p>

<p>Once you seek help from Prisoners Abroad, the Prisoner &amp; Family Support Service will be your point of contact for advice and information. The type of assistance they can offer varies from country to country, but generally they can provide you with information, in English, on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your rights as a prisoner</li>
  <li>issues that may affect you such as health or transfer to the UK</li>
  <li>getting magazines, newspapers, books and the regular Prisoners Abroad newsletter</li>
  <li>learning the language of your country of imprisonment</li>
  <li>translating documents</li>
  <li>grants for food if you are in a developing country and do not have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>grants for essential medicines and toiletries if you do not have funds from other sources</li>
  <li>preparing for release</li>
  <li>help for your loved ones, including information, family support groups and, in a few cases, assistance with the cost of visiting</li>
</ul>
