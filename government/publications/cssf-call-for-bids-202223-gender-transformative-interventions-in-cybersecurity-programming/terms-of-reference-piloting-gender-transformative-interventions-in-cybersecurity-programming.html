<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The Conflict Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) is a unique cross-government fund that tackles conflict, stability and security challenges overseas, which pose the greatest threat to UK national security. Since its inception in 2015, CSSF programmes have addressed threats arising through conflict, serious and organised crime, terrorism and violent extremism in more than 85 countries and territories.  It has been a catalyst for a more integrated UK government response to fragility and conflict, including delivering our commitments under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Fuk-national-action-plan-on-women-peace-and-security-2018-to-2022&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ckieron.robinson2%40fco.gov.uk%7Ca574da77a77b46f9233208da373b5824%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C637883025400144457%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ZtsTHZTcvv6Eogld642ro%2FD%2BvOTO1%2FFD0FAWGbqk%2Brg%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">UK National Action Plan on Women, Peace &amp; Security (<abbr title="Women, Peace &amp; Security">WPS</abbr>) 2018-2022</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1053023/national-cyber-strategy-amend.pdf" rel="external">the National Cyber Strategy</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.publishing.service.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F975077%2FGlobal_Britain_in_a_Competitive_Age-_the_Integrated_Review_of_Security__Defence__Development_and_Foreign_Policy.pdf&amp;data=05%7C01%7Ckieron.robinson2%40fco.gov.uk%7Ca574da77a77b46f9233208da373b5824%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C637883025400144457%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=8AphR7hGzECbrlHJe7x%2FcQ%2FmQmFqgwWrYcEXZL3DgYE%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">Integrated Review</a>.</p>

<p>The UK’s National Cyber Strategy sets out the UK’s priorities in cybersecurity, including to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>improve the understanding of cyber risk to drive more effective action on cyber security and resilience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shape global governance to promote a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strengthen the structures, partnerships and networks necessary to support a whole-of-society approach to cyber</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strengthen the cyber security and resilience of international partners and increase collective action to disrupt and deter adversaries</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the domain of cyberspace and corresponding possibilities for economic, social and military activity are expanding rapidly, existing rules and norms need to keep pace.</p>

<p>In order to be a responsible cyber power, as these rules and norms develop and evolve, it is essential that we adopt a gender-transformative approach to address existing and emerging issues.</p>

<p>Considering gender in international cybersecurity is critical as it shapes and influences our online behaviour; determines access, power and vulnerability and as result, impacts of cyber attacks and threats are different based on gender identity or expression<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. There is also a clear gender gap in the cybersecurity field, with women under-represented in the global information security workforce, driven by numerous social, institutional and personal barriers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. There is some, but limited, understanding of the extent to which cyber threats affect or hinder our ability to achieve our <abbr title="Women, Peace &amp; Security">WPS</abbr> objectives, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The Gender, Peace and Security (GPS) Portfolio funds innovative projects to address emerging trends and gaps within the <abbr title="Women, Peace &amp; Security">WPS</abbr> agenda.</p>

<p>The team are seeking bids that pilot gender-transformative interventions to cybersecurity programming to create a free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace. Any project should have a dual objective:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve gender equality/secure the rights of women, girls and marginalised groups</li>
  <li>make cybersecurity interventions more effective by adopting a gendered approach</li>
</ul>

<p>It will seek to address or explore the prevailing power relations, gendered patterns and how marginalised communities are impacted differentially by discriminatory practices that may perpetuate cyber threats.</p>

<p>All projects should aim to work towards a cyberspace that reflects our values and influence the global environment to ensure a safe and beneficial digital future for all.</p>

<h2>Project content requirements</h2>

<p>Funding innovative research that addresses knowledge gaps and piloting gender-transformative approaches allows the CSSF to build the evidence base for gender transformative cybersecurity programming. The implementer may pilot interventions under the following suggested sub-themes at the intersection of gender and cybersecurity:</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<ul>
  <li>identify and understand how gender influences people’s perceptions and experiences of cyber security including how cyber security technologies and systems can be used to prevent or enable harm to citizens</li>
  <li>identify, develop, or pilot techniques or interventions that lead to more inclusive cyber security within systems</li>
  <li>capturing the security requirements of citizens, in particular how cyber security priorities and needs differ based on gender and how well these needs are met by existing cyber security practices</li>
  <li>understanding how gender biases could influence cyber security decision-making (in design or deployment) and the consequences of these biases</li>
  <li>understanding how cyber security tools, technologies, or systems can be weaponised against people based on gender</li>
  <li>develop approaches to evaluate the efficacy/impact of techniques or interventions in cyber security design or deployment that drive more equitable and inclusive cyber security within systems</li>
  <li>designing security that can adapt and remain resilient as threats evolve to meet the security needs of people in the future</li>
</ul>

<h2>Capacity building and systems strengthening</h2>

<ul>
  <li>knowledge-sharing/capacity building on the gender dimensions of international cybersecurity</li>
  <li>integrating prevention of gendered disinformation into cybersecurity policy, legislation and strategies, advocating with governments, multilaterals and/or business to strengthen definitions, detection and response</li>
  <li>support for networks that consider the intersection of gender and other minorities in cybersecurity</li>
  <li>capacity building for stakeholders involved in cyber incident response (governmental, private sector, and civil society) to recognise gendered implications and respond appropriately</li>
  <li>assistance for states to conduct a gender audit of national or regional cyber security policies to identify areas for improvement, and/or implementation of existing gender audit recommendations</li>
  <li>detection and prevention of cyber-attacks and cybercrimes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> targeting women peacebuilders, women’s rights activists, women’s rights and women-led organisations, and other critical <abbr title="Women, Peace &amp; Security">WPS</abbr> actors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Women’s influence and participation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>increase and improve women’s participation within international cybersecurity, policymaking roles and institutions and participation in cybersecurity dialogue and processes</li>
</ul>

<p>If the implementer considers additional sub-themes to be relevant, we would welcome new and innovative ideas where they align with policy objectives.</p>

<p>Activities should take an inclusive, multi-stakeholder approach, working with local partners where possible to either address gaps in programming and research or&nbsp;demonstrate how the pilot builds on existing research.</p>

<h2>Bidding guidance</h2>

<ul>
  <li>projects will be funded initially between October 2022 to March 2023</li>
  <li>multiyear funding to March 2025 will be considered in exceptional cases, each project will be subject to annual break clauses in March each year</li>
  <li>maximum budget limit: £400,000 (4 hundred thousand pounds sterling) per financial year</li>

<h2>Additional information and documentation</h2>

<p>If the purchase of assets is essential for achieving the project outputs and impact, please complete a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061085/File_4__Equipment_Purchase_Supporting_Letter.odt" rel="external">Equipment Purchase Supporting Letter</a> and submit it with the project proposal and budget.</p>

<p>Digital development costs in excess of £10,000 for “any external-facing service provided through the internet to citizens, businesses, and civil society or non-government organisations” has to be depicted separately in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1061084/File_5__FCDO_Digital_Spend_Proposition_Form_for_Partners.odt" rel="external">Digital Spend Proposal form</a> and be approved by FCDO.</p>

<p>The FCDO is moving away from using a flat NPAC rate, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1015186/Accountable_grant_budget_template_and_cost_eligibility_guidance_frequently_asked_questions_August_2021.pdf" rel="external">guidance</a>. However, for the majority of projects, Admin Costs are unlikely to exceed 10% of the total project budget, but 10% is not a target or a cap. There will be circumstances where admin costs over 10% may still represent value for money and we will review these costs during the review process.</p>

<p>All successful implementers will sign a standard FCDO grant agreement. The terms of the contract or agreement are not negotiable.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Projects should aim to achieve 85% spend by 31 December 2022 and activities should be avoided in the final month of the project; however, we recognise this may not be possible with a short implementation period. Activity Based Budgets should reflect this where possible.</p>
