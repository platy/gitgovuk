<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Project description</h2>

<p>UK Export UK Export Finance has agreed the provision of support to the Greater Changhua Offshore Wind Farm SE Ltd for the development of the Changhua 1 offshore wind farm. This includes the design, construction and operation of an offshore wind farm, consisting of 75 wind turbine generators (WTGs) and a grid capacity of 605.2MW, connected via cables to one offshore substation and one onshore substation that connect into a Taipower substation (‘the Project’).</p>

<p>A key aim of the Project is to provide 605.2MW to the Changua’s total available grid capacity.</p>

<p>The Project includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design</li>
  <li>Construction</li>
  <li>Operation and maintenance service</li>
</ul>

<p>Other ECAs are EKF, Atradius, K-sure and KEXIM. HSBC Is the Lender Bank</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Project sector</h2>

<p>The Project is in the renewable energy sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Project sponsors</h2>

<p>The Project is being developed by Ørsted Wind Power A/S</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>UK exporters</h2>

<p>Various (e.g. Seajacks UK)</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Export Credit Agent Bank</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Amount of UK Export Finance support</h2>

<p>The principle value of the support is approximately £300m.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>OCED common approaches and equator principles</h2>

<p>UK Export Finance categorised the Project as Category A i.e. having potentially significant environmental, social and human rights (ESHR) impacts in accordance with the definition in the 2012 (Revised 2016) OECD Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence (the “OECD Common Approaches”) and the Equator Principles (2020).</p>

<p>As required by the OECD Common Approaches, UK Export Finance disclosed its possible involvement in the Project. A notification was posted on the UK Export Finance web site on 18th February 2021, which directed interested parties to the contact from where published ESHR information can be sourced. UK Export Finance didn’t  receive any comments from interested parties.</p>

<p>ERM was commissioned to undertake an independent environmental and social due diligence review on behalf of the Lender group/ECAs,</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Environmental, social and human rights standards</h2>

<p>Project related ESHR documentation was reviewed for their alignment against the 2012 International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards (PS) on Environmental and Social Sustainability and the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.</p>

<p>The applicable IFC PS were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PS1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts;</li>
  <li>PS2: Labour and Working Conditions;</li>
  <li>PS3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention;</li>
  <li>PS4: Community Health, Safety and Security;</li>
  <li>PS5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement;</li>
  <li>PS6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources;</li>
  <li>PS8: Cultural Heritage;</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicable World Bank Group EHS Guidelines were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General EHS Guidelines (2007);</li>
  <li>EHS Guidelines for Wind Energy (2015);</li>
  <li>EHS Guidelines for Electric Power Transmission and Distribution (2007)</li>
  <li>IFC / EBRD Guidance Note on Workers’ accommodation: processes and standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Nature of ESHR impacts</h2>

<p>The review of potential ESHR risks and impacts took into account the following impacts, receptors and issues during the construction and operational phases of the Project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>health and safety</li>
  <li>waste and hazardous material management</li>
  <li>marine habitats</li>
  <li>emergency planning and response</li>
  <li>construction camp conditions</li>
  <li>grievance mechanisms</li>
  <li>worker conditions of contract</li>
  <li>community engagement</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Assessment of ESHR impacts</h2>

<p>A review was undertaken in line with the requirements of the OECD Common Approaches and Equator Principles to identify potential ESHR risks and impacts of the Project and how these would be effectively managed.</p>

<p>ERM was appointed as the IESC with a duty of care to the Lenders and were commissioned to undertake an ESDD assessment of the Project. The report formed the basis for UKEF’s evaluation of the Project’s alignment with the relevant standards and recommendations for compliance and monitoring</p>

<p>The review included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ERM undertook a visit to the Project sites on 26 August 2020 and 3 September 2020;</li>
  <li>Desk-based review of project-related documentation include but is not limited to: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Report 2018, Environmental and Social Management Plans August 2020, and Stakeholder Engagement Plan.</li>
  <li>Follow-up meetings and interviews with relevant Project representatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>The results of this review formed the basis for the evaluation of the Project’s alignment with relevant international standards, and recommendations for future compliance and monitoring.</p>

<p>Taking account of the review, the Project was deemed to have potential to cause a number of adverse environmental and social impacts both during construction and operation. However, a proposed suite of controls as part of the Project’s environmental and social management systems should facilitate the management of these impacts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Climate change considerations</h2>

<p>UKEF considered the potential direct and indirect green house gas (GHG) emissions of the Project and effects of climate change factors on the Project as part of its ESHR review.</p>

<p>The Project is not considered to be a carbon intensive undertaking (such as fossil fuels or petrochemical) and so “high” GHG emissions in excess of relevant thresholds for quantification and reporting set by international standards were reasonably not envisaged.</p>

<p>The review revealed that the Project design has considered potential physical impacts of climate change such as changes to rainfall and weather patterns.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Decision</h2>

<p>Various actions have been agreed between the Project developer, operator, and parties involved in the financing, which are necessary to ensure the Project’s on-going alignment with international standards. Following agreement of these commitments, it was concluded that the Project should meet the relevant international standards over the Project cycle. UKEF has therefore decided to provide its support in respect of the supply of goods and services by UK exporters to the Project.</p>

<p>A condition of support is that Project will be subject to monitoring and reporting in order to provide satisfaction that the Project is aligned with the relevant international standards throughout the duration of support.</p>
