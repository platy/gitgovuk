<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government has a clear manifesto commitment to end rough sleeping this Parliament. We are making good progress, but there is much still to do. The voluntary and community sector has been intrinsic to the progress achieved so far, delivering essential support, intervention, and advice on the ground. In addition, the sector provides essential links to local services and ensures individuals experiencing homelessness and sleeping rough are empowered to stay within, and strengthen their relationship to, their local community.</p>

<p>The next phase of our work together, outlined in this prospectus, will bring forward the development of a skilled voluntary and community sector, working in partnership with each other and local authorities to deliver a sustained reduction in homelessness and rough sleeping.</p>

<p>In recent years, <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s support for the sector’s activity has continued with grants to a number of voluntary sector organisations to build the capacity and expertise of the wider frontline sector. These grants have supported frontline workers in the voluntary and community sector, as well as in local authorities to meet their duties under the Homeless Reduction Act and to develop skills, expertise and partnerships to deliver a range of prevention, intervention and recovery services.</p>

<p>Our recent engagement with the wider sector and local authorities has told us that despite the many challenges of COVID-19, organisations have identified significant improvements to the coordination of rough sleeping services and partnership working during the COVID-19 pandemic, including improved relations with the health sector. We need to ensure this new way of working is sustained.</p>

<p>Despite these achievements, the profile and challenges of the homeless and rough sleeping population has changed over the pandemic and the sector now faces new complexities and issues to address. Now more than ever supporting the skills, capability and networks of the sector is a critical intervention to deliver an end to rough sleeping and homelessness.</p>

<p>The Spending Review in 2021 has given us the opportunity to look afresh at how we can support the frontline to deliver an end to rough sleeping.</p>

<p>The new VCFS Grant demonstrates <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s ongoing commitment to support and maintain valuable partnerships, develop the skills and experience of staff and volunteers, and to continue to raise the standards of the homelessness sector.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Grant summary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span>	What is the Voluntary, Community and Frontline Sector Grant?</h3>

<p>The Voluntary, Community and Frontline Sector (VCFS) Grant is a new funding approach over the next 3 years, which will continue to support the essential work of the voluntary and community sector.  We are making available a Grant programme delivered through 4 individually biddable lots, which will be managed through agreed workplans and regular monitoring. Bidders are welcome to apply for multiple lots and partnership bids are encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Objectives of the VCFS Grant</h3>

<p>The new VCFS Grant is divided into 4 individually biddable lots, they each have a distinct objective:</p>

<table>
  <thead>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The total commitment for this funding represents a potential investment of up to £8m commencing from 1 July 2022 to 31 March 2025. Table 1 below illustrates the indicative budgets for each lot across a single year. Prospective bidders should endeavour to illustrate excellent value for money, partnership working models and a strong focus on achieving sustained and developed outcomes that prioritise reduction in homelessness and rough sleeping.</p>

<p>The indicative budgets are a guide for bidders. The application form will give bidders the opportunity to provide costs for activities that will be undertaken to facilitate the delivery of the objectives. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will seek to ensure that bids are cost effective and present best value for money.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> What are we looking for?</h3>

<p>The new VCFS Grant programme is an important step towards creating a joined-up voluntary and community sector, continuing to target the outcomes needed to prevent and end homelessness and rough sleeping.</p>

<p>This grant will aim to help staff and volunteers across England access support, training and advice. Therefore, we are looking for a provider (or partnership) that can offer an England wide approach. The application will ask for bidders’ experience in delivering a similar national support offer.</p>

<p>The application form provides the opportunity for applicants to propose their own interventions, service models, and proposals to meet the objectives of the programme, based on their experience. We are open to new tried and tested methodologies and encourage projects that promote innovation and the sharing of intelligence.</p>

<p>The new VCFS Grant is an opportunity for organisations to continue to work in partnership with each other, cementing the successful partnership-led approach achieved during the COVID-19 pandemic. We strongly encourage bidders to look for partnership opportunities that will enhance provision, achieve value for money and efficiencies. You do not need to have a formal partnership agreement in place at this stage. If your bid is successful, you will need a partnership agreement, and this will require the approval of <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> prior to any funding being released.</p>

<p>We will consider bids for single or multiple lots. If you wish to bid for more than one lot, you will have the opportunity in the application to demonstrate how managing multiple lots will improve effectiveness and efficiency of delivery.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span>	Process for assessing applications</h3>

<p>A gateway criteria assessment will be applied to all applications received by the closing date. This process will involve confirmation of eligibility and completion of due diligence checks using standard government tools and procedures.</p>

<p>Applications passing the gateway assessment will be evaluated against 4 specific categories: The Applicant, The Proposal, Outcomes and Outputs and Cost &amp; Value for Money.</p>

<p>The evaluation process is described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#part-4-scoring-process">Part 4</a> of the prospectus. The evaluation will lead to the identification of a preferred bidder for each lot. Once we have formed a list of preferred applicants for each lot, we will begin a process of negotiation and refinement of the proposals to assist in the development of the Grant funding award and agreements.

  <li>Cooperate fully with the assessment and due diligence process, including any TUPE arrangements that may apply (please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#section8">TUPE section</a> below).</li>
  <li>If selected for funding, grantees must sign a Grant Funding Agreement with <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If selected for funding, grantees must deliver proposals in line with agreed plans, within timescales and to budget.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> VAT statement</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> intends to award a Grant to stimulate this activity. This Grant will be governed by a Grant Funding Agreement. The <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> does not intend for there to a contractual relationship with the Grant Recipient. It intends paying the Grant on the receipt of acceptable progress reports, a Grant claim form and the delivery of agreed outcomes. It will not pay the Grant on the basis of an invoice. In consequence, applicants must reassure themselves as to their VAT liability – either to be paid or unable to be recovered.</p>

<p>Any Grant award will not be increased subsequently to meet unforeseen VAT costs. The proposed budget submitted by the applicant should be based, therefore, net of recoverable VAT costs in line with VAT rules on grant payments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span>	TUPE</h3>

<p>It will be the Grant recipient’s responsibility to make enquiries of the present funded organisations to determine where TUPE may apply to the funded activities in the prospectus. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> recommends that interested parties engage with current grantees to understand any liabilities therein.</p>

<p>Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:vcfsgrantprogramme@levellingup.gov.uk">vcfsgrantprogramme@levellingup.gov.uk</a> with TUPE as the subject line, for contact details of current grantees and further information.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transfers-takeovers">guidance on TUPE</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span>	Governance, monitoring and evaluation</h3>

<p>Grantees must comply with the VCFS Grant governance, monitoring, and evaluation requirements, which are as follows:</p>

<h4>9.1 Governance</h4>

<p>Grantees will be in regular contact with members of the Rough Sleeping Delivery Team within <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s Homelessness and Rough Sleeping directorate.</p>

<p>The VCFS Grant outcomes and expenditure will be recorded and monitored by the VCFS Grant Programme Board on a quarterly basis.  The VCFS Grant Programme Board will comprise of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chair (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> Rough Sleeping Delivery Team Leader)</li>
  <li>Project Manager (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> Rough Sleeping Delivery Higher Executive Officer)</li>
  <li>Community and Faith Advisors (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> Rough Sleeper Advisory Team)</li>
  <li>Project Provider Representatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The VCFS Grant Programme Board will report directly to <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s Homelessness and Rough Sleeping Programme Board.</p>

<h4>9.2 Monitoring</h4>

<p>At quarterly intervals, grantees will be expected to provide a reporting update to <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>.  Grantees will be expected to provide a report based on quarterly performance against the agreed outputs.</p>

<h4>9.3 Key Performance Indicators</h4>

<p><abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will provide a core set of key performance indicators (<abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>), which grantees will be expected to report against for performance monitoring purposes. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s core <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) and have been developed and tested by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Grantees will not be expected to collect any personal data for the monitoring and reporting of <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>. A summary of <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s core <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>, can be found below in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table2">Table 2</a>. In addition, applicants are invited to provide additional <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> to demonstrate the outputs and quality of their proposal. Grantees for Lots 3 and 4 will be expected to provide case studies and feedback on a quarterly basis to demonstrate progress and the impact of the service being delivered. A summary of these requirements can be found below in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table3">Table 3</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the application process, bidders will be asked to provide expected numbers for <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s core <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>, (for example: 4 training webinars per quarter in Lot 1) and propose any additional <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> as part of the project delivery. As part of the negotiation process with preferred bidders, <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will agree milestones. The set milestones will be included in the Grant Funding Agreement based on the project plan and information provided in the grantee’s applications.</p>

<p>Following applications to the grant programme, <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will work with preferred grantees to agree the final set of <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> that relate to individual lots/Grant awards in advance of Grant award. (See section 9.4 below). <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> will focus on long-term, sustained outputs which demonstrate progression and service development over the funding period. All <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> will be reviewed on a quarterly basis as agreed through the individual Grant Funding Agreements.</p>

<h4>9.4 Success and impact</h4>

<p>Success and impact of the project will be evaluated against the core outputs and <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr> listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table2">Table 2</a> below, during the quarterly performance review meetings (which will be informed by quarterly narrative reports, KPI and engagement data).</p>

<p>The new programme approach will enable a fuller understanding of the overall Grant, compared to previous individually managed Grants.</p>

<p>The evaluation process will be comprised of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anonymised satisfaction/impact surveys.</li>
  <li>Structured interviews with partner local authorities and sector partners - this will include an internally managed impact evaluation for at least 2 local areas per year.</li>
  <li>Training participant evaluation feedback.</li>
  <li>Case Outcomes Report (Lot 2 only).</li>
  <li>Case Studies (organisation focussed).</li>
  <li>Qualitative Reviews with <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> representatives.</li>
  <li>Sector webinars to gather open views and gauge progress against objectives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each grantee will be expected to complete an evaluation at the end of the delivery period. <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> will provide a template for each project to complete. Grantees will also be asked to produce a statement of Grant usage upon completion of the Grant period.</p>

<h2>Part 4: Scoring process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Marking guidance, scoring and weightings</h3>

<p>Bids will be assessed by a panel comprised of representatives from <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>’s Rough Sleeping Delivery and Commercial Grants teams against the 11 criteria listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#table4">Table 4</a>) and <a class="govuk-link" href="#table5">Table 5</a> below.</p>

<p>Each criterion will be scored 0-3. Any application that scores 0 against any criterion will be disqualified. Each criterion is weighted to reflect its importance to this funding programme. The score for each criterion will be multiplied by its weighting.</p>

<p>The scores for all the criteria will be added to give a total score for the application. The maximum total score is 300.</p>

<p>The total score will be used to compare against other applications. The application with the highest total score will be identified as the preferred bidder. Where two applications are scored equally, or are very similar, <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> may make further enquiries before identifying a preferred bidder.</p>

<p>The score against each criterion will also inform subsequent discussions with the preferred bidder.</p>

<p>The final decision as to which applications receive what level of funding will rest with the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> reserves the right to vary these conditions and the right to either withdraw or reduce the funding if reasonably required, in line with the terms and conditions set out within the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>
