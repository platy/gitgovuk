<h2>Types of correspondence</h2>

<p>We at the Green Homes Grant Scheme (<abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr>) are fully committed to ensuring your successful participation in the scheme. We want you to get your questions answered and hear your feedback so we can make the experience better for you and others.</p>

<p>We take all feedback seriously and we are committed to listening to your views to help us continually improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enquiries and feedback – where you’re seeking guidance, general information, or where you would like to share positive or negative experiences</li>
  <li>complaints - if you’re dissatisfied with a <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> service provision or process and would like to raise a grievance</li>
  <li>appeals – where <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> declines your redemption or payment of a voucher, and you want to challenge the decision</li>
  <li>formal requests - where you are seeking information related to the scheme or your application</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enquiries and feedback</h2>

<p>The Voucher Scheme is closed to new applications. No new applications for funding will be considered.</p>

<p>If you have a query that isn’t answered in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-the-green-homes-grant-scheme">guidance</a>, or you’d like to provide feedback, please contact:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:voucher.project@beis.gov.uk">voucher.project@beis.gov.uk</a></p>
</div>

<p>We can’t respond to enquiries about alternative funding or provide information on other projects.</p>

<p>For information on other energy efficiency initiatives that may be available in your area, use the online service:</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/improve-energy-efficiency">Find ways to save energy in your home</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Our timescales for responding to enquiries and feedback</h3>

<p>We aim to respond to all enquiries and feedback within 10 working days.</p>

<p>If we’re unable to provide a full response within that timeframe, we will provide you with an update explaining how we will resolve the outstanding query.</p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>

<p>If you want to complain about the service provided by <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr>, or are dissatisfied with an appeals service you have received, please submit your complaint by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:voucher.project@beis.gov.uk">voucher.project@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your application reference and voucher number (if applicable)</li>
  <li>your contact details (these should match the details in your application)</li>
  <li>a summary of the issue setting out what has happened</li>
  <li>how you would like us to resolve the issue</li>
  <li>if this is a reply to an original response, please also include the customer reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>If your complaint is about an installer or certification body, you need to contact TrustMark. They will investigate your complaint under their own dispute process. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trustmark.org.uk/homeowners/if-things-go-wrong" rel="external">Find out about the TrustMark dispute process</a>.</p>

<h3>Persistent or serial complaints</h3>

<p>If you’re not satisfied with our initial investigation and outcome, you can contact us again asking for a review of the decision. This review will be undertaken by a senior official within the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr>. You will need to explain why you’re not satisfied with the responses so far and what you would like us to do to sort things out. This is the final stage of the internal <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> complaints process.</p>

<p>If, despite all stages of the complaints procedure having been followed, you write again on the same issue, your correspondence may be recognised as ‘serial’ or ‘persistent’ and we may choose not to respond. If you try to re-open the same issue, you will be informed in writing that the procedure has been completed and that the matter is now closed.</p>

<p>If you raise a new, separate complaint, we will respond to it in accordance with our complaints procedure. The application of a ‘serial or persistent’ marking is against the subject or complaint itself rather than the complainant.</p>

<h3>Our timescales for responding to complaints</h3>

<p>We aim to respond to low complexity complaints within 20 working days.</p>

<p>You must raise the complaint within 2 months of the incident or, where a series of associated incidents have occurred, within 2 months of the last of these incidents. We will only consider complaints made outside this time frame in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h3>Investigation by other bodies</h3>

<p>If other bodies are investigating aspects of the complaint, for example the police, MP, or a Tribunal, this may impact on our ability to adhere to the timescales within this procedure or result in the procedure being suspended until those public bodies have completed their investigations.</p>

<p>If you commence legal action in relation to your complaint, we will consider whether to suspend the complaints procedure in relation to the complaint until those legal proceedings have concluded.</p>

<h2>Appeals process</h2>

<p>If the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> declines the redemption, payment or extension of your voucher based on quality audit findings, you will be sent an email that explains why.</p>

<p>You can appeal this decision through the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> if you think that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was based on a factual error</li>
  <li>it was legally wrong</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> made an error in processing the voucher redemption, payment or extension request</li>
</ul>

<p>To formally appeal this decision, you must submit your appeal to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:voucher.project@beis.gov.uk">voucher.project@beis.gov.uk</a> within 14 calendar days of the date of your decision email.</p>

<p>When submitting an appeal, your request must include your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name or the name of all homeowners and applicants</li>
  <li>full address</li>
  <li>grant reference number</li>
  <li>contact information</li>
  <li>specific reason(s) for appeal</li>
</ul>

<p>You can send additional information to support your appeal claim, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting documentation for your appeal</li>
  <li>additional justification for appealing the grant scheme decision</li>
  <li>any evidence of your engagement with the Appeals Service or make reference to when you called</li>
  <li>a summary of the issue setting out what happened and provide a timeline if possible</li>
  <li>how you would like <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to resolve the issue</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have contacted us previously regarding this or another issue, please set this out in the summary.</p>

<h3>Our timescales for responding to appeals</h3>

<p>After you send your appeal request, you will receive a response acknowledging receipt within 5 working days with your appeals reference number.</p>

<p>Your application will be considered in full against the selection criteria. All decisions will be based on the information included in your application, current scheme policies, and documents provided with your appeal.</p>

<p>All decisions will be recorded in the response that will be sent to you within 10 working days from the receipt of your appeal request. You will also be provided with additional detail explaining the basis for the decision as well as additional steps you can take, where relevant.</p>

<p>Decisions will be made in line with the policies established by the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> or the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (<abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Formal requests</h2>

<h3>Make a Data Subject Right request (<abbr title="Data Subject Right">DSR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>As set out in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-homes-grant-privacy-policy/privacy-policy-for-scheme-participants">privacy policy</a> you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. For example, you can request a copy of your personal data held by us in relation to the <abbr title="Green Homes Grant Scheme">GHGS</abbr> in line with UK data protection laws.</p>

<p>To make a <abbr title="Data Subject Right">DSR</abbr> (including to request a copy of your personal data), please send your request directly to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dataprotection@beis.gov.uk">dataprotection@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will need 2 documents to verify your identity including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a photocopy of the identification pages of your current passport or of a current photo driving licence</li>
  <li>a copy of a current utilities bill (such as an electricity bill), or other document which includes your name and current address. This can be returned to you if required</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also need any additional information to enable us to execute targeted searches, for example, a customer reference number, if applicable.</p>

<h3>Make an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request</h3>

<p>Make a Freedom of Information request by contacting us using the details below.</p>

<div class="contact contact">
    <p class="govuk-body">Freedom of Information requests</p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4">

        </p>


    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">We are unable to respond promptly to letters sent in the post at the moment. Please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:foi.requests@beis.gov.uk">foi.requests@beis.gov.uk</a> to ensure we can respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible.</p>

</div>

<h2>Record keeping</h2>

<p>We will record the progress of all issues raised, including information about actions taken at all stages, for example, the stage at which the complaint was resolved, and the outcome. The records will also include copies of letters and emails, and notes relating to phone calls.</p>

<p>This material will be treated as confidential and held centrally as appropriate and will be viewed only by those involved in investigating the complaint, including where necessary the scheme administrator.</p>

<p>This is except where the Secretary of State (or someone acting on their behalf) or the complainant requests access to records of a complaint through a freedom of information (<abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr>) request under the Freedom of Information Act or through a data subject rights request (<abbr title="Data Subject Right">DSR</abbr>) under the UK <abbr title="General UK Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, or where the material must be made available during an inspection.</p>

<p>Records of complaints will be kept securely, only for as long as necessary and in line with data protection law, our privacy policy and record retention schedule.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-homes-grant-privacy-policy/privacy-policy-for-scheme-participants">Read the Green Homes Grant privacy policy for further details on sharing your information</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Staying protected</h2>

<p>We take your privacy and security seriously. To help you stay protected, here are some things that we will never do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send someone to your home to collect cash, passbooks, bank cards or anything else that contains sensitive personal information</li>
  <li>ask you to email or text personal or banking information</li>
  <li>call or email you to ask for any PIN numbers or online passwords</li>
  <li>send an email with a link to a page which asks you to enter any online log-in details</li>
  <li>call or email you to authorise the transfer of funds to a new account or hand over cash</li>
  <li>ask you to carry out a test transaction online</li>
</ul>

<p>Fraud and scams no longer target just the elderly and vulnerable. Often criminals will use ways of getting hold of your bank or other personal details to steal money from your account(s). Fraud is becoming ever more sophisticated, but people are still caught out by traditional phone and letter scams, so you must remain constantly alert to suspicious activity. Fraud comes in many guises whether a home visit, phone call, letter, text, email or on the web. One common factor though is that they are all hoping to con you out of your cash.</p>

<h3>If something does not feel right</h3>

<p>If you are ever suspicious of anyone who claims to be from the Green Homes Grant Voucher Scheme, or you feel unsure of an email you have received, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:voucher.project@beis.gov.uk">voucher.project@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>You can also report scams to Action Fraud:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/" rel="external">Action Fraud online</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:report@phishing.gov.uk">report@phishing.gov.uk</a></li>
  <li>phone 0300 123 2040</li>
</ul>

<p>It shares information with the police about scams.</p>

<p>For advice or help from Trading Standards, call the Citizens Advice Helpline on 0808 223 1133. If you think you’ve revealed sensitive information or payment details to a scammer, contact your bank. It will be able to help protect your accounts from fraud. If you’ve lost money to a scam, see what you can do to get your money back.</p>
