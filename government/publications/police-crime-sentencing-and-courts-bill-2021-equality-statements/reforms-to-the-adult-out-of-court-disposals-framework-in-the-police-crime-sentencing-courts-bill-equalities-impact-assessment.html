<h2>Policy summary</h2>

<p>The reform aims to simplify the adult Out of Court Disposals (OOCDs) framework, to ensure consistency across police forces in the way low-level offences are dealt with out of court. The new framework will reduce the number of OOCDs from six to two in legislation, comprising an upper tier disposal titled ‘Diversionary caution’ and a lower tier disposal titled ‘Community caution’.</p>

<p>The two statutory OOCDs will allow police to attach conditions or actions to the disposal, meaning that the recipient needs to engage in some way with the outcome. This replaces the outcomes in some of the current OOCDs which are warnings or cautions which require no action.</p>

<p>This emphasises the acceptance of responsibility for the offending behaviour by the recipient and enables the police to refer people to support services, where relevant, as part of the conditions of the disposal. Referral at this early stage to relevant interventions services, such as substance misuse services, can help address the underlying causes of offending behaviour and help reduce reoffending or escalation of offending behaviour.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>OOCDs are an important tool in addressing early stages of offending behaviour. They allow the police to deal quickly with low-level offending without recourse to the courts. They can maximise the use of officer time – achieving a satisfactory outcome for the public while allowing officers to spend more time on frontline duties tackling more serious crime. They are also an opportunity to provide intervention and support to potential offenders at the early stages in criminal behaviour, diverting them into rehabilitative services to help reduce escalation of offending.</p>

<p>The current adult OOCD framework has developed organically and in response to different needs at different times. At present, there are six adult OOCDs: community resolutions, simple cautions, conditional cautions, cannabis warnings, khat warnings and penalty notices for disorder (PNDs). These are a mix of statutory and non-statutory disposals. Some are simply warnings not to reoffend while others allow the police to attach conditions, such as paying compensation to a victim or attending a rehabilitative programme. Some police forces use two of the options, others use all six and some a hybrid in between.</p>

<p>A joint government and police review of OOCDs included a public consultation <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> which ran from November 2013 to January 2014. This sought views from the public, as well as practitioners within the criminal justice system, including the police, the judiciary and the Sentencing Council. The consultation responses confirmed that the OOCD framework was in need of reform. In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Over half of respondents did not believe OOCDs deterred offending. As such, it was felt that there should be a framework with more meaningful and proportionate consequences – i.e. a move away from ‘warnings’ and ‘cautions’ to a system with stricter repercussions.</li>
  <li>Consultation respondents also felt that the current framework required simplification. It was seen as unnecessarily complicated, proving difficult for practitioners to implement and for the public to understand, thus reducing confidence in the justice system.</li>
  <li>It was felt that police forces and PCCs should be more directly accountable to their local communities for their use of OOCDs, with a more transparent system for explaining and justifying their operation of OOCDs, especially in the case of serious or repeat offences.</li>
  <li>Respondents felt there should be a greater focus on reparation to victims. For instance, simple cautions were seen as ineffective as they do not require an offender to make reparation for their actions. Conditional cautions and community resolutions were seen as preferable since they can involve use of reparative conditions and potential use of restorative justice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The joint government and police response to the consultation was published in November 2014<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. It set out plans to reduce the number of disposals from six to two.</p>

<p>To take this forward, in 2014-15 we piloted a ‘two-tier framework’ in three police forces<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>. The three forces only used two of the six disposals: conditional cautions and community resolutions, which ensured that all disposals included an action which was either rehabilitative, reparative or punitive. This was intended to move away from common practice in most police forces which is heavily reliant on simple cautions that are warnings not to re-offend with no conditions or follow-up action attached.</p>

<p>The evaluation highlighted generally positive responses from police, and victims welcomed the opportunity for engagement in the condition-setting process. However, it was noted that adequate time to implement change would be required to roll this out, allowing for frontline officer training and service-level agreements to be established with intervention providers.</p>

<p>In addition, a 12-month proven reoffending analysis <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> looking at outcomes between the pilot and the counterfactual areas showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the pilot areas and the counterfactuals in relation to the likelihood of reoffending, the severity of reoffending or the time taken to reoffend following a caution.</p>

<p>However, re-offending results may not account for variations in effectiveness of individual conditions. We do not have this level of detail, and the interventions used were not consistent across the three pilot areas. It is ultimately the effectiveness of specific conditions which are most likely to impact on reoffending, rather than simply the creation of a new structure which enables condition-setting.</p>

<p>International evidence suggests that certain rehabilitative programmes (e.g. drugs, mental health, anger management initiatives) can reduce re-offending. For example, the meta-analyses quoted in a Cambridge University evidence review <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> suggests that a mature OOCD framework that directs offenders to effective treatment programmes could have an impact on reoffending. More research in the UK around effective treatments for individuals will be of value.</p>

<p>The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) supported the move to a two-tier structure and published a strategy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> at the end of 2017 encouraging a voluntary move by forces to use only conditional cautions and community resolutions. All forces signed up to the strategy. Some have moved fully to the two-tier model, some are in transition and others retain the full six OOCDs options.</p>

<p>MoJ has continued to support this voluntary implementation of the two-tier model and believes the time is right to move this to a legislative footing, ensuring that all forces are using a consistent OOCD framework.</p>

<p>Streamlining the options would bring national consistency, an opportunity for early intervention with vulnerable offenders, and a greater focus on victims.</p>

<h2>Proposed Legislative Reform of OOCDs Framework</h2>

<p>Primary legislation will be introduced to establish two OOCDs in statute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Diversionary Caution - along the lines of the current statutory Conditional Caution, which allows police to set enforceable conditions within a specified time period. If breached, a prosecution for the original offence can be pursued. Conditions could be rehabilitative (e.g. engagement with mental health or substance abuse services), reparative (e.g. financial compensation, restorative justice process, formal apology) or punitive (e.g. unpaid work). Receiving this would form part of a criminal record. Diversionary cautions will become spent after 3 months, or, if earlier, when a prosecution is commenced due to non-compliance in line with the current conditional caution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Community Caution - along the lines of the current Community Resolution is intended for low-level offences and will become spent immediately.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As such, police would use only two statutory OOCDs, Diversionary and Community Cautions, and not PNDs, simple cautions, cannabis or khat warnings. Fixed Penalty Notices are not within scope of this reform.</p>

<p>There will be restrictions on the use of the new OOCDs in relation to certain serious offences and on repeat use for the same or similar offences, which will be specified in secondary legislation.</p>

<p>Police may choose to continue to use the non-statutory disposal of Community Resolution (CR) for low-level offences as it does not require a formal admission. The CR could be used in certain schemes or pilots where circumstances or evidence suggests it would address issues of race disparity. We will explore the appetite for this approach as part of the implementation planning phase, where we expect to see a revised CR policy from the NPCC, which will form part of the accompanying guidance on the use of the new out of court disposal framework, ensuring there is consistency in its use across all forces.</p>

<p>The MOJ also lead on a pilot called ‘Chance to Change’, which operates in two Policing areas. This scheme does not require the offender to admit guilt, and this aims to test the effect of this approach with ethnic minority offenders. The evaluation of these pilots will help inform future policy.</p>

<p>In addition to the new framework, we will also commence a study, conducting research which will provide new insight about how police use out of court disposals to support adults with mental health and other health related vulnerabilities. This will enable government departments to work collaboratively to facilitate better policy and practice for effective working between police, NHS and other service providers, and it will produce practical advice applicable for front line teams. The overarching objective is to help reduce reoffending by providing vulnerable offenders access to relevant health support at an early stage in their interaction with the criminal justice system.</p>

<h3>Equality duties</h3>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/pdfs/ukpga_20100015_en.pdf" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>, when exercising its functions, the MoJ has an ongoing legal duty (PSED) to pay due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other prohibited conduct under the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between different groups of persons who share a protected characteristic and those who do not</li>
  <li>foster good relations between different groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also recognise that, as well as having an obligation not to directly or indirectly discriminate against disabled people, the MoJ as a service provider has a duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people.</p>

<p>The payment of due regard to the PSED needs to be considered in light of the nine protected characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Race</li>
  <li>Sexual Orientation</li>
  <li>Marriage/Civil Partnership</li>
  <li>Gender (sex)</li>
  <li>Religion or Belief</li>
  <li>Gender Reassignment</li>
  <li>Disability</li>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Pregnancy/Maternity</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Lammy Review 2017</li>
</ul>

<h3>Affected groups</h3>

<p>The proposed change will have a direct impact on adults who commit first time or infrequent lower-level offences.</p>

<p>Under the reform, any offender who is eligible for an OOCD through the nature of the offence and circumstances of the offence, can be offered either a Diversionary caution or a Community caution.</p>

<p>These eligibility criteria do not change from the existing, current model.</p>

<p>It should be noted that these reforms are for the adult OOCDs framework only, so under 18’s will not be affected as the existing youth justice OOCD framework will continue to apply.</p>

<h3>Penalty notices for disorder</h3>

<p>Approximately 21k PNDs were administered for adults in the year ending December 2018. The table below breaks down adult offenders who received PNDs by ethnicity and sex. PND figures for ethnicity are categorised using self-identified classification.

<h3>Cautions</h3>

<p>Approximately 60k cautions were administered for adults in the year ending December 2018. The table below breaks down adult offenders who received cautions by ethnicity and sex. Caution figures for ethnicity are categorised using officer-identified classification and as such are not directly comparable to self-identified figures as in the PND or population data.

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<h4>Sex</h4>

<p>The data above suggests that males are more likely to receive a PND or caution. A female is more likely to receive a caution rather than a PND.</p>

<h4>Ethnicity</h4>

<p>It is difficult to make a robust comparison of the data given the issues raised around the proportion of cases where ethnicity is unknown and the different classification systems. Taking the data at face value would suggest that black individuals are more likely to receive a PND or a caution when compared to their representation in the wider population.</p>

<h4>Other protected characteristics</h4>

<p>We do not have enough information to consider the other protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>Victims, witnesses, and the general public</h3>

<p>The change should have a positive impact on victims.</p>

<p>Both the OOCD options will give the opportunity to make swift reparation to victims. The current Code of Practice on Conditional Cautions will be revised to reflect the reformed framework and the updated version will continue to stress that the views of the victim should be obtained wherever possible.</p>

<p>New Guidance on both the Diversionary and Community caution will be developed and in line with Conditional Cautions, it will stress the importance of victims’ views in reaching resolutions and in achieving, where possible, restorative justice.</p>

<p>Possible conditions attached to Diversionary and Community cautions, with direct impact and benefit for victims, will include reparative actions such as apologising, repairing or otherwise making good any damage caused to an individual victim; financial compensation to make good any loss or damage to property; reparation or compensation to any relevant neighbourhood or community.</p>

<p>We are not able to identify by protected characteristics the victims or witnesses involved in the cases of these offenders. However, the Crime Survey for England and Wales for the year ending March 2020 showed that men and people from a non-white ethnic group were over-represented among victims of crime.</p>

<h3>Analysis of offenders and victims from the pilot</h3>

<p>Data on the protected characteristics of the victims and offenders was collected during the pilot carried out in 2014/15. This data was limited to age, gender and ethnicity.</p>

<p>The analysis only considers the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than a CR. It does not address the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than no disposal. Ideally, the model would have addressed the causal factors associated with an offender receiving a CC, a CR or no disposal. Unfortunately, no data were available relating to offenders who received no disposal, so this analysis was not possible.</p>

<h4>Analysis of offender characteristics</h4>

<p>A multivariate analysis was conducted to investigate which OOCD disposal an offender received in the pilot areas, modelling the likelihood of receiving a Conditional Caution (CC) rather than a Community Resolution (CR), against a range of factors including offender age, gender and ethnicity.</p>

<p>The key results worth noting are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Male offenders are more likely to receive a CC than female offenders.</li>
  <li>Offender ethnic group is not associated with the type of OOCD received. While the analysis suggested other ethnic groups were less likely to receive a CC than white individuals, this was not statistically significant.</li>
  <li>Age is associated with the type of OOCD received. Offenders aged 51-60 and aged 60+ are statistically less likely to receive a CC than offenders aged under 20. However, the following age categories are more likely to receive a CC than offenders aged under 20:
    <ul>
      <li>21 to 25 year olds;</li>
      <li>26 to 30 year olds; and</li>
      <li>31 to 40 year olds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Offences flagged for domestic violence are more likely to receive a CC than those which are not DV-flagged (which may well be a reflection of the guidance to pilot forces which said that a CR was inappropriate for offences involving intimate partner domestic violence). There is no relationship for those flagged for hate crime in relation to which OOCD they were likely to receive.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Analysis of victim characteristics</h4>

<p>As with offender characteristics, a multivariate analysis was conducted to investigate which OOCD disposal an offender received in the pilot areas – modelling the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than a CR – against a range of factors including victim age, gender and ethnicity and controlling for any previous receipt of an OOCD and current committed offence.</p>

<p>The key results worth noting are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Victim age is marginally associated with the offender receiving a CC rather than a CR. Only victim ages of 31-40 and 51-60 are associated with lower odds of receipt of a CC for the offence committed against them.</li>
  <li>The gender of the victim is not associated with the offender receiving a CC rather than a CR, though receipt of CCs is less likely where victim gender is unknown.</li>
  <li>With victim ethnicity, the ‘no data recorded’ category showed a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving a CC than the reference category of ‘White’;</li>
  <li>Victim type was associated with type of OOCD. Offences involving individual victims were less likely to receive a CC whereas offences committed where there was no identified victim were statistically significantly more likely to receive a CC than the reference category of organisational victim; and</li>
  <li>As with the offender model, DV-flagged cases were statistically significantly more likely to receive a CC than non-flagged cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further detail and the full results of this analysis on both offenders and victims is set out in Annex A.</p>

<h2>Equality considerations</h2>

<h3>Eliminating unlawful discrimination</h3>

<h4>Direct discrimination</h4>

<p>Direct discrimination occurs when a policy would result in someone being treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic. We believe that reforming the OOCDs framework is not directly discriminatory within the meaning of the 2010 Act, as it applies in the same way to all individuals regardless of their protected characteristics. It is the nature of the offence and the offender’s criminal record which determines whether it is appropriate to deal with the matter without recourse to the courts.</p>

<p>Therefore, no offender would be treated less favourably in relation to any protected characteristic as a direct result of this policy.</p>

<h4>Indirect discrimination</h4>

<p>Indirect discrimination occurs when a policy applies equally to all individuals but would put those sharing a protected characteristic at a particular disadvantage compared to those who do not. We believe that reforming the two-tier OOCD framework may pose a risk of indirect discrimination within the meaning of the Equality Act as explained below.</p>

<p>For both tiers of the statutory framework, the offender needs to admit guilt and agree to the particular OOCD in order for the offence to be dealt with outside the court process. This reflects the current status of most OOCDs, with the exception of Penalty Notices for Disorder and Fixed Penalty Notices which do not require the offender to admit the offence, but have a mechanism by which the offender can elect to have their case heard in court.</p>

<p>We know from the Lammy Review<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> that some ethnic minority defendants have little trust in the CJS or in the officers in the police station, which can lead them to offer a ‘no comment’ response interview or not admitting to the offence. This can result in an escalation of the matter by the police resulting in a prosecution.</p>

<p>There is therefore a risk that the requirement to accept responsibility or admit guilt would mean individuals from an ethnic minority would be less likely to receive an early intervention via an OOCD and would be more likely to be prosecuted.</p>

<p>It is therefore important that in approaching this policy we work to mitigate risk that this could be perceived to disadvantage anyone. We are, therefore, taking two important steps:</p>

<p>i. Continue to operate the Chance to Change pilots so that we can inform our long term approach.</p>

<p>ii. Operate this policy in the context of CJS scrutiny panels, with independent chairs, who should carefully consider any disproportionality in respect of race and OOCDs.</p>

<p>The Chance to Change model places less emphasis on admission of guilt and can divert offenders to intervention services. A full admission is not required in order for an offender to be diverted in this way, although outright denials are not allowed. Evaluation of the pilots will be undertaken.</p>

<p>All police officers already undergo mandatory training which includes substantial coverage of ethics, equalities, self-understanding, hate crimes and policing without bias. The College of Policing, who set and maintain training standards for policing, published a Code of Ethics in 2014, which includes a set of principles for policing, including that all officers and staff should take active steps to oppose discrimination and make their decisions free from prejudice. Despite the risk identified above, we consider that this change is a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of creating an OOCD framework that provides consistency, simplification and opportunity for engagement with intervention services. Overall, therefore, we do not consider that the policy change is likely to result in any unlawful indirect discrimination.</p>

<h4>Discrimination arising from disability and duty to make reasonable adjustments</h4>

<p>Related to the point made above on the requirements for an OOCD, it is important to ensure that individuals with disabilities (including those with learning difficulties or mental health issues) understand the implications of admitting guilt or accepting responsibility for the offence committed, and how they can comply with the conditions imposed on them. The current Code of Practice for Adult Conditional Cautions states that officers must have regard to the provisions of PACE Code C concerning mentally disordered or mentally vulnerable offenders and the use of an appropriate adult. This provision would be reinforced in the revised Code of Practice.</p>

<p>In so far as this change extends to disabled people, we believe that the policy is proportionate, having regard to its aim. It would not be reasonable to make an adjustment so that those with disabilities are out of scope of the proposals, but it remains important to make reasonable adjustments to ensure appropriate support is given. We do not consider that any adjustments are required for disabled people over and above the ones already in place for those receiving OOCDs.</p>

<h4>Harassment and victimisation</h4>

<p>We do not consider there to be a risk of harassment or victimisation within the meaning of the Equality Act as a result of this change.</p>

<h3>Advancing equality of opportunity</h3>

<p>OOCDs offer an opportunity to refer low-level offenders to relevant interventions services, such as health and substance misuse services, to address underlying factors that are contributing to offending behaviour. There may also be opportunities for referrals to mentoring and employment support opportunities.</p>

<p>OOCDs can help to divert first time and low-level offenders away from further contact with the CJS and into meaningful and rewarding life choices.</p>

<p>These opportunities will apply, where available, to all recipients of an OOCDs. We therefore consider that these changes will help advance equality of opportunity.</p>

<h3>Fostering good relations</h3>

<p>In addition, we recognise that in order to build the trust of all communities, the police workforce must better reflect today’s modern, diverse society. The police officer workforce is more diverse in terms of ethnicity and gender than ever before, but there is still much more to be done. The Home Office’s drive to recruit 20,000 officers over the next three years gives us a significant opportunity to attract a wide range people into a career in policing and support the police to achieve this aim.</p>

<p>We believe the policy aim of the reform the OOCD framework is a proportionate means of achieving our legitimate aim and that there will be positive impacts for victims and recipients of the disposals.</p>

<h4>Continuing analysis</h4>

<p>The equality duty is an ongoing duty and we will draw on any data that could provide evidence on the impact of this change.</p>

<h2>Annex A: multivariate analysis of the 2014/15 pilot</h2>

<h3>Analysis of the impact of offender characteristics on type of OOCD issued</h3>

<p>Table A.1 presents results from a multivariate analysis that investigates which OOCD disposal an offender received in the pilot areas. The likelihood of receiving a Conditional Caution (CC), rather than a Community Resolution (CR), was modelled against the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offender age, gender and ethnicity;</li>
  <li>Whether the offence was flagged for domestic violence and/or hate crime; and</li>
  <li>Controls for receipt of any previous OOCDs, pilot site and offence type though these are not reported in the table.</li>
</ul>

<p>All explanatory factors are listed in the first column of Table A.1. For the purposes of the analysis these are expressed as either in the reference category (e.g., White in the case of ethnicity) or one of the other categories. The next column contains odds-ratios of the effect of having a particular characteristic on the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than a CR compared to the reference category.</p>

<p>An odds ratio is a relative measure of an association between a given factor and the probability of receiving a CC rather than a CR. In the example of ethnicity, the odds ratio for the category Asian is a comparison of the likelihood of receiving a CC for Asian offenders relative to the likelihood of receiving a CC for white offenders. If the number is greater than the number one, then the probability for Asian offenders is higher than that of white offenders. If the odds ratio is less than the number one, then the probability for Asian offenders is lower than that of white offenders. In this example, the odds ratio for Asian offenders relative to whites is 0.85 suggesting that Asian offenders are less likely than white offenders to receive a CC instead of a CR. However, this finding is not statistically significant so it could be said that there is no difference between Asian offenders and white offenders in the likelihood of receiving a CC instead of a CR.</p>

<p>Shown in the two right-hand columns are the 95 percent confidence intervals. That is, the estimated odds ratio is likely to lie between these two numbers with 95 percent confidence. As mentioned above, odds ratios above the number one signify an increased likelihood, while figures below the number one signify a decreased likelihood. Statistically significant effects will have 95 percent confidence intervals that do not straddle the number one. Statistically significant estimated odds ratios are marked with an asterisk (*).</p>

<p>The model is a logistic regression. Logistic regression is a statistical technique that assesses the association between, in this case, the probability of receiving a CC relative to a CR and various factors. Special accommodation is made mathematically to account for the limited numerical range that probabilities can take, i.e., between zero and one where zero means no likelihood and one means absolute certainty. The major strength of this approach is that the impacts of different factors are independent effects. That is, the results give the impact of being in a particular category, rather than a reference category, assuming no other differences.</p>

<h3>Limitations of offender analysis</h3>

<p>The limitations of the analysis are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The analysis only considers the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than a CR. It does not address the likelihood of receiving a CC rather than no disposal. Ideally, the model would have addressed the causal factors associated with an offender receiving a CC, a CR or no disposal. Unfortunately, no data were available relating to offenders who received no disposal, so this analysis was not possible.</li>
  <li>We collapsed the age of offender into categories.</li>
  <li>The model is limited to the pilot areas, allowing a clear distinction between Community Resolutions and Condition Cautions to be modelled. This allows the domestic violence and hate crime flag data to be included.</li>
  <li>Data on prior recordable offending were not available. Only the offence for which the OOCD issued and prior OOCD receipt within the pilot period can be controlled in the model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results of multivariate analysis of offender data</h3>

<p>The results of the multivariate analysis are detailed in Table A.1. Statistically significant odds ratios are marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p>Controlling for prior OOCD receipt, pilot site and offence type, key results worth noting are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Male offenders are more likely to receive a CC than female offenders;</li>
  <li>Offender ethnic group is not associated with the type of OOCD received.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Age is associated with the type of OOCD received. Offenders aged 51-60 and aged 60+ are statistically less likely to receive a Conditional Caution than offenders aged under 20. The following age categories are more likely to receive a CC than offenders aged under 20:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>21 to 25 year olds;</li>
      <li>26 to 30 year olds; and</li>
      <li>31 to 40 year olds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>OOCDs where offences are flagged for domestic violence are more likely to receive a CC than those which are not DV-flagged. There is no relationship for those flagged for hate crime in relation to which OOCD they were likely to receive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analysis of victim characteristics</h3>

<p>The analysis presented in Table A.2 was carried out to investigate which OOCD disposal an offender received, modelling the likelihood of receiving a Conditional Caution, rather than a Community Resolution, against the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What type of victim was involved (an individual, an organisation, or none recorded);</li>
  <li>The age, gender and ethnicity of the victim (where an individual);</li>
  <li>Whether the offence was flagged for domestic violence, or hate crime;</li>
</ul>

<p>The model also controls for any previous receipt of an OOCD, pilot site and the specific offence committed though these are not reported in the table.</p>

<p>This model focuses on the characteristics of the victim. As will be discussed below, the data relating to the victims of offences that result in OOCDs have considerably more missing data than the data relating to the offence, disposal and offender. The addition of the victim data into the existing offender model (detailed above) ran the risk of missing data substantially affecting the results produced: as a result, the decision was made to run a separate model which focuses on the data relating to the victim characteristics.</p>

<h3>Limitations of the victim analysis</h3>

<p>The limitations of the analysis are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As noted above, considerable amounts of victim-related data were not recorded (61% for victim age; 23% for type of victim; 72% for whether they were a repeat victim; 68% for victim ethnicity; 60% for victim gender). In many cases, this was due to victim characteristics not being asked of, or pertaining to, organisational victims (for example, age, gender or ethnicity), though there were still considerable amounts of missing data. In order to include all types of victim within the model, these missing data were coded as a separate category.</li>
  <li>The other limitations of the offender characteristics model still apply: non-inclusion of where the disposal was given; the model is limited to the pilot areas, and age of the victim has been collapsed into categories.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results of multivariate analysis of victim data</h3>

<p>The results of the multivariate analysis are detailed in Table A.2. Statistically significant odds ratios are marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p>Note: Sample size is limited due to missing data that have not otherwise been controlled in the model.  Model fit statistics suggest that this model adequately fits these data.</p>

<p>Controlling for prior OOCD receipt, pilot site, and offence type, key results from this analysis are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Victim age is marginally associated with the offender receiving a CC rather than a CR. Only victim ages of 31-40 and 51+ are associated with a lower likelihood of CC receipt.</li>
  <li>The gender of the victim is not associated with the offender receiving a CC rather than a CR, though receipt of CC is less likely where victim gender is unknown.</li>
  <li>With victim ethnicity, the ‘no data recorded’ category showed a statistically significantly higher likelihood of the offender receiving a CC than the reference category of White;</li>
  <li>Victim type was associated with type of OOCD. Offences involving individual victims were less likely to receive a CC than CR. In contrast, offences committed where there was no identified victim were statistically significantly more likely to receive a CC than the reference category of organisational victim.</li>
  <li>As with the offender model, DV-flagged cases were statistically significantly more likely to receive a CC than non-flagged cases.</li>
</ul>
