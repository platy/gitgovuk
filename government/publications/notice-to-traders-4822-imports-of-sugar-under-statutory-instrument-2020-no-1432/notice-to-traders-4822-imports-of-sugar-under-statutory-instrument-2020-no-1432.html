<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This notice explains how the rules are applied to this quota and how to apply for a licence. It also advises you of the quota amounts available in the July 2022 quota application period. Details of the quantities available are given in Annex 1 of this notice.</p>

<h3>Proof of Trade</h3>

<p>You must provide the following documents to prove that you are eligible for a sugar quota licence. If you do not have the proof of trade as detailed below, you are not eligible, and you cannot apply for a quota licence.</p>

<p>You must be established and registered for VAT in the UK. You must tell us your current VAT registration number. You can provide your VAT number on your quota licence application or send us a copy of your current VAT certificate. However, if your company is part of a group VAT registration number, we will need to see a copy of your current VAT certificate before the quota deadline.</p>

<p>If this is your first application in the quota year you must provide evidence to prove that you have imported at least 25 tonnes of sugar during:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The 12-month period ending two months before the first application can be submitted for the quota year (1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021); and</li>
  <li>The 12-month period immediately before that (1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020).</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC agents or representatives cannot apply for import licences under these quota arrangements.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>Your quota application must be received between 1 July and 7 July 2022. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application, all additional documentation and the security are correct at the time of submission and they are received by the RPA before 5pm on the 7 July 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We will reject any applications where the application, security and / or proof of trade is received after 5pm on 7 July 2022.</p>

<p>You must submit your licence applications using an AGRIM import licence application form. We advise you to use the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agrim-import-licence-application-form-for-agricultural-products">application form</a>. You can submit your licence application by either post or email. The email address for licence applications is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Your application must not exceed the quantity available. You must not lodge more than one import quota licence application for the same order number.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you lodge more than one application for the same order number, all your applications will be rejected.</p>

<p>Any unused quota will be carried forward to the next application period in June.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>You must lodge a security of £20 per tonne with each licence application.</p>

<p>You can find further information on how to lodge your security by searching for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licence-securities-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">Licence securities for the import/export of agricultural products’ on GOV.UK</a></p>

<h3>Completing a licence application</h3>

<p>As part of the sugar import tariff quota, licence applications must include at least the following entries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Box 20 of your application must contain the correct import tariff quota order number. You must also include “Statutory Instrument 2020/1432”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not sure of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) code for your product (box 16) you should contact HMRC by sending an email containing as much information about the product as possible to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:classification.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk">classification.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>. They will be able to provide you with the correct code and description.</p>

<h3>Issuing Licences</h3>

<p>As soon as the application period has closed, we will collate details of all valid quota applications we received and calculate the reduction coefficient applicable to each order number. Details of these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-tariff-rate-quotas-allocation-of-co-efficients">reduction coefficients</a> will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Licences will be issued towards the end of July 2022 for use from 1 August 2022.</p>

<p>Please note, the reduction in duty will only be valid for the quantities shown in sections 17 and 18 of your licence.</p>

<p>As licences will only be valid for imports into the UK, your licence will be issued electronically. We no longer issue paper import licences.</p>

<p>Import licences will be valid from 1 August 2022 until the end of the 2021/22 quota period, 30 September 2022 (except for the Albanian sugar quota). Where an electronic licence is issued an email can be sent to inform you of its issue. To receive this email notification, you must have already completed the appropriate sections of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licences-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">il3 form</a>.</p>
