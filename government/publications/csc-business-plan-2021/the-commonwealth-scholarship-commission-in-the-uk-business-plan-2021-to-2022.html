<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>The Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK (<abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>) provides the UK government scholarship scheme led by international development objectives. It operates within the framework of the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (<abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan">CSFP</abbr>) and offers a vivid demonstration of the UK’s enduring commitment to the Commonwealth. By attracting individuals with outstanding talent and identifiable potential from all backgrounds and supporting them to become leaders and innovators on returning to their home countries, the <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s work combines sustainable development with the UK national interest and provides opportunities for international partnerships and collaboration.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr> uses rigorous procedures to ensure that its programmes promote equity and inclusion, reward merit, and deliver widespread access, especially to those from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p>In everything we do, we aim to be:</p>

<p><strong>Development-focused</strong>: by placing the international development agenda at the heart of our activities.</p>

<p><strong>Collaborative</strong>: by working with a range of stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusive and accessible</strong>: by ensuring that our portfolio of awards offers opportunities to all who are capable of benefiting from them and qualified to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant</strong>: by providing opportunities that address the evolving development needs of Commonwealth countries while at the same time supporting the UK’s national interest and the knowledge economy.</p>

<p><strong>Efficient and accountable</strong>: by ensuring that our work delivers value for money, is effectively and proportionately reviewed, and that emerging findings are used in our future planning.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr> is a non-departmental public body, for which the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) is the lead department and main sponsor. FCDO funding supports awards exclusively for candidates from low and middle-income countries. Scholarships funded by FCDO are offered under 6 development-related themes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Science and technology for development</li>
  <li>Strengthening health systems and capacity</li>
  <li>Promoting global prosperity</li>
  <li>Strengthening global peace, security and governance</li>
  <li>Strengthening resilience and response to crises</li>
  <li>Access, inclusion and opportunity</li>
</ul>

<p>Other financial contributions are received from the Department for Education (DfE) for scholarships for candidates from high income countries, along with at least £5 million in matching contributions generated through partnerships with UK universities.</p>

<p>This Business Plan sets out the objectives and priorities for the Commission during the 2021 to 2022 financial year, and its budget for the year. It has been agreed with the FCDO that due to the unprecedented impact of Covid-19 on the work of the Commission during 2020 to 2021, the financial year 2021 to 2022 would be treated as a one-year extension of the <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s current 3-year strategy which runs from 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>The next 3-year Strategy for 2022 to 2025 is currently being developed by the Commission.</p>

<h2>Objectives and priorities for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Between 2018/19 to 2021/22, the <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s objectives are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to provide a world-class scholarship scheme that contributes to sustainable development across the Commonwealth</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that our programmes promote equity and inclusion, reward merit, and deliver widespread access, especially to those from disadvantaged backgrounds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to support and encourage cutting-edge research, innovation, and knowledge exchange across the Commonwealth</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s priorities during 2021 to 2022 will be:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to continue to monitor the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on Scholars and Fellows; to assign necessary financial resources where necessary; to adapt our approach as needs require; and to offer an enhanced wellbeing and welfare service to Scholars and Fellows throughout this unprecedented time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to ensure that all FCDO-funded scholarships are focused on 6 development-related themes, and that prominence is given to ‘Science and technology for development’ and ‘Strengthening health systems and capacity’, awarded against the background of continuing global efforts to address and mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to maintain selection procedures that ensure that FCDO-funded scholarships are awarded to candidates who would not otherwise be able to undertake the programme of study, and that, all other things being equal, candidates demonstrating social or economic disadvantage receive preference during selection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to maintain the target that 90 to 95% of new FCDO-funded awards will be for citizens of least developed and lower middle-income countries and fragile states</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deliver a comprehensive Evaluation and Monitoring Programme that reports Impact against the CSCs Evaluation Framework and Theory of Change</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deliver a time limited-programme of Professional Fellowships in Equity and Access in Girls’ Education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to continue to strengthen our relationship with nominating bodies, to ensure that processes are robust and transparent, and that the programme continues to attract the best candidates, whose work is relevant to national needs as well as attracting candidates in line with the Commission’s Equity and Inclusion Strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deliver a comprehensive Engagement Strategy which ensures that the newly developed virtual activities are embedded alongside face to face activities (should it be possible to hold these) to maximise engagement opportunities for our Scholars and wider stakeholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deliver the <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s Alumni Strategy, integrating new virtual activities, in order to demonstrate the impact of <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s awards and to further develop measures to demonstrate its outputs and outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to deliver a workplan of activities to showcase the impact of the work of <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr> Alumni on climate change and to maximise networking opportunities for Scholars and Alumni around COP26</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to agree the Commission’s Strategy for 2022/23 to 2024/25</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Key performance indicators</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr> has agreed 7 key performance indicators which will be used to measure success against our objectives and priorities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The highest number of FCDO-funded scholarships will be awarded under the ‘Science and technology for development’ and ‘Strengthening health systems and capacity’ themes, with all FCDO-funded scholarships awarded under 6 development-related themes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>90 to 95% of new FCDO-funded awards will be made to citizens of least developed and lower middle-income countries and fragile states as recognised by FCDO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Selection committees will ensure that, all other things being equal, excellent candidates demonstrating social or economic disadvantage or who are from marginalised or underrepresented communities receive preference, with an increased proportion of candidates from a disadvantaged background being selected year on year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Priority for awards will be Commonwealth Split-Site, Master’s, Shared, and Distance Learning Scholarships, with the balance of funding allocated to FCDO-funded Commonwealth PhD Scholarships held at or below 2018 and 2019 levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the gender balance of candidates selected for a FCDO-funded Scholarships will be at least 45% female and 45% male.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least £5 million in 20201 to 2022 in matching contributions will be generated through partnerships with UK universities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Alumni Strategy will ensure alumni are engaged in activities designed to demonstrate their impact at a local, national, and international level as well as the contribution of their Commonwealth Scholarship or Fellowship in achieving positive change for the intended communities and end users.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Budget and resources 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>A budget is illustrated, based upon the award of £28.224m by FCDO in June 2021 and an anticipated Grant-in-aid of £250K from DfE. Confirmation of a DfE grant is still forthcoming. The <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr>’s administration resource will be £424,000 in 2021 to 2022 the same as in 2020 to 2021. Table 1 below shows the full budget illustrated for 2021 to 2022 as approved by the <abbr title="Commonwealth Scholarship Commission">CSC</abbr> Finance Committee in July 2021. £342k remained unallocated at the July 2021 Finance Committee meeting to be allocated once the cost of quarantine for the 2021 cohort of scholars is known.</p>
