<h2>Service availability</h2>

<p>Full service available.</p>

<h2>Planned downtime</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Thursday 24 February 2022 8pm to 11:59pm</p>
</div>

<p>Due to scheduled maintenance you will be unable to access the HMRC free online filing service from 8pm to 11:59pm on Thursday 24 February 2022.</p>

<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>

<h2>Service issues</h2>

<h3>HMRC free Corporation Tax online return service not showing final submission response</h3>

<p>HMRC are aware that the free Corporation Tax online return service may not display the final submission status during filing.</p>

<p>Customers who submit returns using the HMRC service will receive an on-screen acknowledgement (‘Submission successful’ or ‘Submitted’) during online filing, but this does not confirm the final status. Customers using the free service need to sign in again and check the dashboard to establish the submission outcome, which will be either ’Submission error’ or ‘Submission complete’ (successful).</p>

<p>Customers are strongly advised to sign back into the service following online submission and view the dashboard. You can track your submissions here to determine the final submission status anytime within 30 days of filing.</p>

<h3>Changes that may affect your company tax return</h3>

<p>Legislation was introduced in the 2021 Spring Budget to support business investment.</p>

<h3>Super-deduction and 50% first-year allowances</h3>

<p>Between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023, new capital allowances are available for companies to claim for qualifying expenditure on new plant and machinery. Main rate expenditure will qualify for a 130% super-deduction and special rate expenditure will qualify for a 50% first-year allowance where the conditions for the new capital allowances are met.</p>

<p>Find out more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-temporary-tax-reliefs-on-qualifying-capital-asset-investments-from-1-april-2021">new temporary tax reliefs on capital asset investments from 1 April 2021</a>.</p>

<p>The HMRC Corporation Tax online service will not be updated to support these new capital allowances until April 2022. If you do not need to report these new reliefs, you can continue to file online in the normal way before the Corporation Tax online service is updated.</p>

<p>If you do need to submit a super-deduction and/or 50% first-year allowance (SR allowance) claim or report a balancing charge online before April 2022, it is possible to do this utilising existing capital allowances boxes. For CT600, boxes 725 and 750 can be used for claim amounts, boxes 730 and 755 can be used to report balancing charges and box 775 can be used for qualifying expenditure until the online service has been updated and new boxes are available.</p>

<p>Companies using the HMRC free filing service (<abbr title="Company Accounts and Tax Online">CATO</abbr>) wishing to claim the new super-deduction will only be able to file when the Corporation Tax online service is updated in April 2022. If you need to file your Company Tax Return urgently before April 2022, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact">contact your HMRC office</a> for further advice.</p>

<h3>Freeports: Enhanced Structures and Buildings Allowance</h3>

<p>An enhanced rate of Structures and Buildings Allowance is available to businesses to claim for the capital construction costs of certain new structures and buildings situated in designated Freeport tax sites. The enhanced rate is 10% per year for 10 years where the conditions for the new capital allowance are met.</p>

<p>The HMRC Corporation Tax online service will not be updated to support this new capital allowance until April 2022. If you do not need to report this new relief, you can continue to file online in the normal way before the Corporation Tax online service is updated.</p>

<p>If you do need to submit an enhanced Structures and Buildings Allowance claim online before April 2022, it is possible to do this utilising existing capital allowance boxes. For CT600, boxes 711 and 736 can be used for claim amounts and box 771 can be used for qualifying expenditure until the online service has been updated and new boxes are available.</p>

<p>Companies using the HMRC free filing service (<abbr title="Company Accounts and Tax Online">CATO</abbr>) will not be able to make claims to the enhanced Structures and Buildings Allowance using that service.</p>

<h3>Freeports: Enhanced Capital Allowances</h3>

<p>An enhanced capital allowance is available to companies to claim for qualifying expenditure on plant and machinery for use primarily in designated Freeport tax sites. The enhanced capital allowance is 100% of the qualifying expenditure where the conditions for the new capital allowance are met.</p>
