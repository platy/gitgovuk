<p>A public consultation on <a rel="external" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/children2019s-home-team/adoption-and-children-coronavirus-amendment-regula/" class="govuk-link">Changes to the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020</a> is open until 28 February 2021. This guidance will be updated following the results of the consultation.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance is about safeguarding and protecting the welfare of vulnerable children and young people. It is non-statutory and should be used to support children’s social care services and providers to work with children and families during the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>Information for providers of non-residential respite services (such as holiday clubs and out of school provision) is available in the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protective-measures-for-holiday-or-after-school-clubs-and-other-out-of-school-settings-for-children-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/protective-measures-for-out-of-school-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak">protective measures for out-of-school settings during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#who-this-guidance-is-for">actions for early years and childcare providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>Where providers need to offer transport to enable children with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> to access respite services, they should follow the principles set out in the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-to-school-and-other-places-of-education-autumn-term-2020/transport-to-school-and-other-places-of-education-autumn-term-2020" class="govuk-link">transport to schools and other places of education: autumn term 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone involved in promoting the welfare, protection and care of children is working extremely hard in the face of unprecedented challenges to support the most vulnerable during this period. We recognise that the children’s social care workforce and multi-agency partners are supporting and caring for some of our most vulnerable children and young people every single day and are, as always, providing a vital service during this time.</p>

<p>We appreciate the dedication and determination of all those who are working to protect vulnerable children and young people, facing challenges that they have never had to face before in these extraordinary times.</p>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic represents a time of severe pressure across society, which we know presents heightened levels of risk for some children. It is, therefore, especially important that these children continue to receive the services and support they need. Our aim is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>continue to prioritise the safeguarding, and protect the welfare, of vulnerable children and young people</li>
  <li>maintain delivery of children’s social care during the pandemic</li>
  <li>support continued effective operations of children’s social care when public health measures may act as a barrier, for example as a result of local intervention measures</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance should be used to support children’s social care services and providers to work with children and families during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It is underpinned by a set of principles which should inform local decision-making and day to day practice with children and families. It also recognises the approach that many local authorities and providers are taking.</p>

<h2>Main changes to previous guidance</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">02 March </span> 2021</h3>

<p>From 8 March, all pupils should attend school. Read how this change will impact the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#vulnerable-children" class="govuk-link">vulnerable children and young people attendance at educational settings</a></li>
  <li><a href="#alternative-provision" class="govuk-link">alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) schools and providers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Guidance for unaccompanied asylum seeking children (<abbr title="unaccompanied asylum seeking children">UASC</abbr>) has been revised in accordance with Department of Health and Social Care guidelines on how to quarantine when you arrive in England.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>The difficult and complex decisions that need to be taken during this period should be made in the spirit of the following principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>child-centred - promoting children’s best interests: nothing is more important than children’s welfare; children who need help and protection deserve high-quality and effective support as soon as a need for help is identified</li>
  <li>risk-based - prioritising support and resources for children at greatest risk</li>
  <li>family-focused - harnessing the strengths in families and their communities</li>
  <li>evidence-informed - ensuring decisions are proportionate and justified</li>
  <li>collaborative - working in partnership with parents and other professionals</li>
  <li>transparent - providing clarity and maintaining professional curiosity about a child’s wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Duties in primary legislation are unchanged</h3>

<p>The duties to our most vulnerable children and young people that are set out in primary legislation (such as in section 22(3) of the Children Act 1989 and section 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and section 11 of the Children Act 2004) remain in place and local authorities and other bodies must continue to comply with these duties. This guidance and the secondary legislative changes that came into force on 25 September seeks to respond to the challenging context that coronavirus (COVID-19) poses to the normal operation of services.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read alongside existing primary legislation and regulations. You should also read relevant statutory guidance including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2" class="govuk-link">working together to safeguard children</a>, and:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<p>This guidance will remain in force until the current regulatory changes expire on 31 March 2021.</p>

<h2>Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h2>

<p>As part of its response to coronavirus (COVID-19), the government carefully considered the flexibilities needed to support the effective delivery of children’s social care services, while always ensuring children’s safety and welfare remained paramount. The Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 came into force on 24 April 2020.</p>

<p>The Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 expired on 25 September 2020. The regulations cannot be used after this date. However, new regulations will continue to provide some flexibility in relation to three areas – see section below on temporary regulations – and actions taken under some other provisions will continue to apply after this date, in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adoption suitability assessments</li>
  <li>fostering suitability assessments</li>
  <li>private fostering notifications</li>

<h2>Temporary regulations</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/909/contents/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2020</a> (‘the temporary regulations’) temporarily amend a series of 6 regulations which are applicable during periods of national lockdown.</p>

<p>The temporary regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allow visits to take place over the telephone, a video link or other electronic communication methods, where face-to-face visits are not possible due to coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
  <li>change the rules regarding health assessment in the process for approving adopters and foster carers, as long as assessments are obtained and considered for the final stage and prior to approval</li>
  <li>suspend the minimum frequency of Ofsted inspections, recognising that assurance visits will be conducted using a risk-based approach</li>
</ul>

<p>The temporary regulations are intended to be used where the flexibilities are still needed to provide effective support for children involved with children’s social care services during the pandemic. These can be when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would be contrary to any guidance relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) published by Public Health England or the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</li>
  <li>it is not reasonably practicable for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<p>The overarching approach to making use of these legislative flexibilities should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approval at chief officer level in local authorities and, where appropriate, top tier management level in other services and providers</li>
  <li>properly recording the use, along with the reasons for doing so and communicating to the other safeguarding partners and providers</li>
  <li>each local authority and provider recording the reason or reasons for use of a flexibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Ofsted will take note of any use of these flexibilities, so providers should be ready to explain why their use was necessary, for what length of time and how any possible longer-term impacts were mitigated. This should be available to share with Ofsted, and others such as Independent Reviewing Officers, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The records may be used to inform Ofsted’s annual engagement meetings with local authorities and in any local authority or provider inspection activity. Ofsted will review the relevant records if they receive any complaints, concerns or whistleblowing.</p>

<p>The temporary regulations are in place until 31 March 2021. A <a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/children2019s-home-team/adoption-and-children-coronavirus-amendment-regula/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">public consultation on whether to extend this temporary suspension</a> was launched on 9 February and ran until 28 February 2021.</p>

<h3>Delivery of services</h3>

<p>We want to support the effective delivery of all children’s social care services at this time, whilst always ensuring children’s safety is paramount.</p>

<p>Local leaders, local safeguarding partners, the social care workforce, and the wider children’s workforce understand the needs of the children in their area and have the skills and knowledge to make decisions in their best interests. In line with government advice, local authorities, providers and local safeguarding partners should consider how to create the best working environments for their teams whilst prioritising face-to-face contact with children where possible. It is important for employers to consider how to create and maintain a safe working environment for all staff and those they support, in particular those who are at increased risk.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has agreed that Ofsted will undertake assurance visits in relation to children’s social care establishments and agencies during an interim period from September 2020 until the end of March 2021 and minimum inspection intervals for these settings will remain suspended until April 2021. A <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/children2019s-home-team/adoption-and-children-coronavirus-amendment-regula/">public consultation on whether to extend this temporary suspension</a> was launched on 9 February and ran until 28 February 2021.</p>

<p>In response to coronavirus (COVID-19), the Home Office and the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) have put temporary arrangements in place, to provide standard and enhanced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-of-charge-dbs-applications-and-fast-track-barred-list-check-service" class="govuk-link">DBS checks and fast-track emergency checks of the adults’ and children’s Barred Lists</a>, free of charge. This applies to the children’s social care workforce in England and Wales, being recruited in connection with the provision of care and treatment of coronavirus (COVID-19), or those being recruited to backfill roles because of the impact of the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Children’s social care</h2>

<h3>Social work practice</h3>

<p>There should be no blanket changes to social work practice, but coronavirus (COVID-19) brings additional risk and complexity and may necessitate some different ways of working which should always be risk-based.</p>

<p>Within any restrictions on social distancing and contact, local authorities can revert to considering broader family networks as sources of support and respite for children and families. Wider support networks can provide an important protective factor for children at risk and should be prioritised, within the broader framework set by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing">government guidance on social distancing</a>.</p>

<h3>PPE equipment for children’s social care staff</h3>

<p>Guidance for infection prevention and control in children’s social care settings, including the specific circumstances where PPE should be used, can be found in the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for children’s social care workers</h3>

<p>Education, childcare and children’s social care settings and providers must ensure they understand the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">NHS testing and tracing for coronavirus process</a> so that they know how to respond if anyone within the setting is suspected or confirmed to have coronavirus (COVID-19). They must also know how to contact their local <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacts-phe-health-protection-teams" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> health protection team</a>, and do so as soon as they have a confirmed case or an overall rise in suspected cases.</p>

<p>Anyone who displays symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) should request a test. Tests can be booked on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS testing and tracing for coronavirus website</a> or ordered by telephone via NHS 119.</p>

<p>Settings must take swift action when they become aware that someone who has attended has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the advice from their local <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contacts-phe-health-protection-teams" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> health protection team</a>, settings must ask those people who have been in close contact with the person who has tested positive to self-isolate for 10 days from the day after contact with the individual who tested positive.</p>

<p>Following the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care’s announcement on 10 January to prioritise all critical workers who cannot work from home for rapid, regular asymptomatic testing, the government is working with individual local authorities to establish community testing plans appropriate for their areas. This expansion of asymptomatic testing will identify more positive cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) and ensure those infected self-isolate, protecting the wider community. This is crucial given that approximately 1 in 3 people have coronavirus without displaying any symptoms. Those working in children’s social care should be prioritised for this testing and should contact their local authority to find out how to access this.</p>

<h2>Virtual visits - local authorities</h2>

<p>The temporary regulations allow visits to a looked-after child, as required by the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, to be carried out over the telephone, a video link or other electronic communication methods.</p>

<p>During periods of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national lockdown</a>, the use of virtual visits should be the exception and can be used as a result of public health advice or when it is not reasonably practicable to have a face-to-face visit otherwise for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). This could include in the event of local or national restrictions, self-isolation or social distancing advice due to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>As good practice, children and young people should be told why a face-to-face visit is not possible and be advised of their right to advocacy or support.</p>

<p>This does not provide blanket cover for all such visits to be held virtually. Wherever possible, visits should be held face-to-face. This can include considering whether it is possible to move the time or location of the meeting within the statutory timescales.</p>

<p>The temporary regulations require any virtual visits to be held in accordance with any recommendations from the nominated officer. When making recommendations, nominated officers should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the wishes of the children and young people affected</li>
  <li>the ability of the child or young person to engage in a virtual visit due to reasons such as their age, disability, learning difficulty or use of English, for example with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children</li>
  <li>whether there is an established bond between the social worker and the child or young person</li>
  <li>any other factors the nominated officer thinks relevant</li>
</ul>

<p>All uses of this temporary flexibility must be recorded in individual case files. These records should include the reasons why a virtual visit was necessary, and the name of the nominated officer consulted. Local authorities and social workers should consider available guidance on the use of virtual visits such as that issued by the principal social worker network.</p>

<h3>Social worker visits</h3>

<p>Children and families may feel anxious about infection risks. Where this is the case and families are reluctant to engage with social workers, social workers should explain why it is essential that they have access to the home, or that they see and speak to the children, to ensure they are safe and well. Visits should be face-to-face where possible and should be sufficient to meet the intended purpose of the visit whether that is safeguarding or promotion of the child’s welfare.</p>

<p>Social workers should consider the different needs of babies and young children, as well as disabled children, who may not have verbal communication abilities.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that existing general duties on local authorities under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 in relation to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children in need in their area remain unchanged. This is also the case for duties under section 47 of the same Act as regards investigating cases where the local authority has cause to suspect that a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm.</p>

<p>There may, of course, be other reasons why families may refuse access. Where they do, and there is a risk to the life of the child or a likelihood of immediate serious harm, local authorities should follow the immediate child protection procedures set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">working together to safeguard children guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Advocacy support for looked after children</h2>

<p>The ongoing provision of advocacy for looked-after children is of critical importance and, as such, local authority duties to provide it remain unchanged. The DfE-funded <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coramvoice.org.uk/for-professionals/always-heard-the-national-advocacy-helpline-and-safety-net-for-england/">Always Heard</a> safety net service continues to be fully operational and can be contacted at 0808 800 5792. The Children’s Commissioner’s <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/help-at-hand/">Help at Hand</a> service is also available on 0800 528 0731.</p>

<h2>Support for children who have a social worker</h2>

<p>Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children remains of paramount importance. For many parents, carers and children, access to support, including the services offered by other safeguarding partners, educational settings or the third sector, can be invaluable in helping to keep children safe and families supported. Multi-agency support should continue, with appropriate flexibility in how this is delivered, for example, via telephone or online support rather than face-to-face meetings, where necessary. Where face-to-face contact can be provided safely, this is expected.</p>

<p>Local authorities should be conscious of reduced protective factors from abuse and neglect available to children and families and increased stressors as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19), and work with local safeguarding partners to ensure continuity and consistency of support.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities for missing children</h2>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty under Section 47 of the Children Act 1989 to investigate if they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. This duty would apply to a missing child in their area, regardless of where they went missing from. This can be from home or from a care setting if they are a looked-after child.</p>

<p>Responsibilities to missing children and children at risk of going missing remain unchanged and we expect local authorities to use their judgement on a case by case basis, to find suitable ways to meet their statutory duties, guided by the principles set out in both this and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/children-who-run-away-or-go-missing-from-home-or-care">children who run away or go missing from home or care</a> guidance.</p>

<p>Local authorities should continue to refer to the statutory guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/care-of-unaccompanied-and-trafficked-children" class="govuk-link">care of unaccompanied migrant children and child victims of modern slavery</a> regarding action to mitigate risks to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children.</p>

<h2>Educational settings</h2>

<h3>Vulnerable children and young people attendance at educational settings</h3>

<p>From 8 March, all pupils should attend school. Secondary pupils will be offered asymptomatic testing on site in secondary schools. Pupils who consent to testing should return to face-to-face education following their first negative test result. Pupils not undergoing testing should attend school in line with their school’s phased return arrangements. Vulnerable children and children of critical workers in secondary schools should continue to attend school throughout, unless they receive a positive test result. Testing is voluntary, but strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>The definition of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision#vulnerable-children-and-young-people" class="govuk-link">vulnerable children and young people</a> includes children who have a social worker, an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr>) plan or who may be vulnerable for another reason at local discretion (“otherwise vulnerable”).</p>

<p>Where pupils who are self-isolating are within our definition of vulnerable, it is important that their education provider put systems in place to keep in contact with them.</p>

<p>When a vulnerable pupil is asked to self-isolate, their education provider should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify their social worker (if they have one)</li>
  <li>agree with the social worker the best way to maintain contact and offer support</li>
</ul>

<p>Their education provider should have procedures in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check if a vulnerable pupil is able to access remote education support</li>
  <li>support them to access it (as far as possible)</li>
  <li>regularly check if they are accessing remote education</li>
</ul>

<p>We have published a <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Learning-development/social-work/covid-19/COVID-19-updates-for-social-work.aspx#Informationforchildandfamilysocialworkers" rel="external" class="govuk-link">toolkit of resources and guidance to help social workers in conversations with children and families about school attendance</a>.</p>

<p>Social workers should be in communication with schools and, where possible, engaged in conversations with the school and parents to put in place strategies to reduce the risk of exclusion.</p>

<p>We have reiterated to schools that they should, as far as possible, avoid permanently excluding any pupil with an education, health and care plan or a looked-after child. Where a looked after child is at risk of exclusion, the <abbr title="virtual school heads">VSH</abbr>, working with others, should consider what additional assessment and support needs to be put in place to help the school address the causes of the child’s behaviour and prevent the need for exclusion, and make any additional arrangements to support the child’s ongoing education in the event of an exclusion.</p>

<p>We know from growing evidence that many children identified at the start of the pandemic as clinically extremely vulnerable (<abbr title="clinically extremely vulnerable">CEV</abbr>) are not at increased risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19 and children are gradually being removed from the shielding patient list (SPL) as appropriate, following review with a clinician. The advice for pupils who have been identified as clinically extremely vulnerable is to shield and stay at home as much as possible until further notice. They are advised not to attend school while shielding advice applies nationally. All 16 to 18 year olds with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality will be offered a vaccine in priority group 6 of the vaccination programme.</p>

<p>Pupils and students who live with someone who is clinically extremely vulnerable, but who are not clinically extremely vulnerable themselves, should still attend school or college.</p>

<p>Education providers covered by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/remote-education-temporary-continuity-direction-explanatory-note" class="govuk-link">Temporary Continuity Direction</a> are required to provide remote education to pupils who are unable to attend school on-site because they are complying with government guidance or legislation related to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h3>Risk assessments for children and young people with an education, health and care plan</h3>

<p>Following the March closure of schools and colleges to most pupils and students, local authorities and settings were asked to undertake risk assessments for children and young people with <abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr> plans. These risk assessments are no longer required.</p>

<p>Pupil level risk assessments, which were used last spring, should not be used to filter children and young people in or out of attendance, but could be helpful to prioritise the amount of time in school children can get if full time attendance for all is not possible.</p>

<p>Local authorities and educational settings should make their own judgements as to whether risk assessments continue to be useful for each child or young person after they have returned full time. They may for example prove useful to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help identify any additional support that pupils need in order to make a successful return to full-time education</li>
  <li>to help reassure pupils, families, and staff that it is safe for the pupil to be welcomed back to their setting in the event that children and young people have to self-isolate; or if there is a local outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a child or young person with an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care plan">EHC</abbr>) plan has a social worker, the social worker should be involved in maintaining any risk assessment. Where a child is looked-after, the local authority virtual school head should also be involved.</p>

<h2>Alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) schools and providers</h2>

<p>All pupils in alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) settings should attend school full-time, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academies</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools</li>
  <li>independent <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Where they are affected by the Remote Education Temporary Continuity Direction, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings must provide remote education to pupils covered by the direction whose attendance would be contrary to government guidance or law around coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p><abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings must comply with health and safety law which requires employers to assess risks and put in place proportionate control measures.</p>

<p>When working through the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/963541/Schools_coronavirus_operational_guidance.pdf#page=7&amp;zoom=100,93,338" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a>, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings should take steps to minimise social contact and mixing as far as is practicable.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings, especially larger <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> schools, should consider whether pupils can be placed into smaller groups and still receive a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>

<p>Due to the smaller size of many <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings, and because <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings are not typically organised by year groups, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> settings may wish to adopt whole school bubbles as part of their system of controls.</p>

<p>You may encounter instances where some settings cannot provide their usual interventions and provision at adequate staffing ratios, or with staff with vital specialist training. They may need to alter the way in which they deploy your staff and use existing teaching and support staff more flexibly. If, having pursued all the immediate options available, they still have concerns about staffing capacity, they should talk to the local authority or academy trust point of contact. They should continue to work collaboratively with families to agree an approach that is in the child or young person’s best interests.</p>

<h2>Multi-agency</h2>

<h3>Multi-agency child protection conferences</h3>

<p>Local authorities, other safeguarding partners and regulated services are working incredibly hard to deliver their statutory duties in ways that are consistent with social distancing requirements and restrictions on free movement.</p>

<p>Multi-agency working is crucial to ensuring the protection of children at risk of harm, and multi-agency child protection conferences should, therefore, go ahead, using video conferencing or conference calling solutions where appropriate. We welcome the commitment shown by local authorities and their partners in ensuring that vital information sharing and joint risk assessments continue to benefit children.</p>

<p>Child protection conferences and multi-agency front door assessments of referrals are particularly critical to protecting vulnerable children and young people. We recognise that there may be instances where multi-agency working will need to be done differently during this period, within the framework set out in law and statutory guidance, and we encourage local authorities and safeguarding partners (including the police and health service) to make use of alternative technological solutions in the circumstances to ensure they are able to make timely decisions in the best interests of the child.</p>

<h3>Barriers to sharing information where there are concerns about a child</h3>

<p>Practitioners will be aware of the importance of sharing information in a timely way, particularly in the current circumstances. Any practitioner working with a child can share relevant sensitive personal information lawfully, including without consent, if it is necessary for the exercise of functions imposed by legislation such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safeguarding or promoting welfare</li>
  <li>in order to keep a child safe from harm</li>
  <li>to protect their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing</li>
</ul>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection">Data Protection Act 2018</a> do not prevent, or limit, the sharing of information by those with safeguarding or welfare duties towards children for the purposes of keeping children safe.</p>

<p>Practitioners are reminded that if they are concerned about a safeguarding data sharing matter, they are advised to seek advice from legal representatives where appropriate, from other practitioners, or from the information governance lead, in line with guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice">information sharing for practitioners providing safeguarding services</a>.</p>

<h2>Social care services for disabled children and young people</h2>

<h3>Short break services (also known as respite)</h3>

<p>Families caring for a disabled child or young person are entitled to short breaks services (also known as respite). We recognise the challenges for local authorities and providers in providing short breaks throughout the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the significant impact of reduced provision on families and on children and young people themselves.</p>

<p>Services which provide respite care for disabled children are able to continue to operate during periods of national lockdown, with specific provision in the legislation allowing for both services which care for children away from home and care which is delivered in the family home, which is for respite purposes either for the child or young person or the carer who looks after the child or young person. This can include continued operation of Residential Holiday Schemes for Disabled Children where appropriate.</p>

<p>We continue to encourage local authorities to prioritise this support for disabled children and to consider flexible and pragmatic options to deliver that support, for example, some local authorities have made more use of direct payments beyond their usual criteria. Direct payments may be used to enable families to purchase respite care and equipment to use at home, for the child or young person and their siblings. Direct payments could also be used to support families with a disabled child whose usual services have been suspended or reduced.</p>

<p>The Council for Disabled Children has worked with providers to produce <a rel="external" href="https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/help-resources/resources/short-break-learning-examples" class="govuk-link">short break learning examples</a>. These case studies are examples of the effective ways services can operate so that children, young people and their families can access vital support with confidence.</p>

<p>Where families rely on informal arrangements provided by family or friends, families are able to form a ‘childcare bubble’ with another household for the purposes of informal childcare, where the child is 13 or under, as part of a consistent childcare arrangement. Where a young person with <abbr title="special educational needs and disability">SEND</abbr> is over the age of 13, a linked childcare household cannot be provided. However, the exception that allows for respite care to be provided applies to those who are vulnerable or people with a disability and it applies to the carers of such people.</p>

<h2>Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel</h2>

<h3>Notifying the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel</h3>

<p>Understanding any changes in the nature and complexity of serious incidents as a result of the current situation will be critical in how the government responds and reacts to support safeguarding partners.</p>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide a serious incident notification of all incidents where a child dies or is seriously harmed, and abuse or neglect is known or suspected. Serious incident notifications should be sent to the panel within 5 working days of the local authority becoming aware of the incident.</p>

<p>The online notification system remains active and available 24 hours a day.</p>

<h3>Rapid reviews</h3>

<p>A rapid review continues to be a vital tool for learning from serious incidents locally and nationally. Whilst the non-statutory timescales were relaxed to support safeguarding partners’ capacity during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (from 1 April 2020), it is important that rapid reviews are once again held in a timely manner. Therefore, from 1 October 2020, the 15-day expectation for undertaking and reporting a rapid review is reinstated and should be followed as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-safeguarding-practice-review-panel-practice-guidance" class="govuk-link">Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel: practice guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Local child safeguarding practice reviews</h3>

<p>Local child safeguarding practice reviews should be completed and published as soon as possible and no later than 6 months from the date of the decision to initiate a review.</p>

<p>Safeguarding partners must also send a copy of the full report no later than 7 working days in advance of publication to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the panel <a href="mailto:NationalReviewPanel@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">NationalReviewPanel@education.gov.uk</a>, and</li>
  <li>the Secretary of State for Education <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mailbox.cpod@education.gov.uk">mailbox.cpod@education.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fostering</h2>

<h3>Suitability assessments – continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h3>

<p>Where the fostering service provider has started the assessment process for a new foster carer before 25 September 2020 under regulation 26 of the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011, it must continue to assess that individual as though all the amendments in the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 that came into effect from 24 April 2020, to the 2011 Regulations remain in force. This means that the service provider can continue to choose whether to refer the case to the fostering panel for a recommendation on suitability.</p>

<p>It can still notify the applicant of a decision not to approve them as suitable to foster as soon as is reasonably practical, once all the relevant information has been gathered. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fostering service provider can continue to decide if it refers the case to a panel for a recommendation on suitability</li>
  <li>a panel can still go ahead under reduced quoracy (not having enough members to carry out business and cast votes)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is to avoid restarting the assessment process for foster carers from the beginning when the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 expired on 25 September 2020.</p>

<h2>Temporary approval – continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h2>

<p>Where the responsible authority has started to assess a person as a temporary foster carer under regulation 24, or has approved a person under regulation 24, before 25 September 2020, the responsible authority can continue these assessments and approvals in accordance with the amendments made by the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020. This means that temporary approvals for non-connected persons can continue if the assessment was started before or on 25 September, and that these placements can continue for up to 24 weeks.</p>

<p>Assessments under regulation 24 started on or after 25 September must comply with the original regulations and as such can only allow the temporary approval of a connected person for a maximum of 16 weeks while an assessment of suitability is completed.</p>

<h3>Self-isolating or ill foster carers</h3>

<p>We recognise the importance of maintaining a stable setting for children wherever possible. In most cases, we expect that children will continue living with their foster carers, observing government guidance on self-isolation and social distancing.</p>

<p>If foster carers develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), the foster home should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection guidance</a> to avoid the spread of infection, and the fostering service should follow the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#what-care-should-be-taken-in-foster-care-settings" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings</a>, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>

<p>In circumstances where this is not possible, we would expect fostering services to identify alternative temporary placements with other carers, or respite carers for the duration of the foster carer’s illness. We would then expect the child to return back to their usual home.</p>

<h3>Number of children that a foster household can care for</h3>

<p>Foster carer approval terms, including age range and number of placements, may need to be flexible in the current circumstances. Schedule 7 to the Children Act 1989 currently allows for some flexibility in placing multiple children together by allowing local authorities to grant exemptions to the usual fostering limit in specific placements. Schedule 7 also allows the usual fostering limit to be exceeded if the children concerned are all siblings.</p>

<p>Where fostering services continue to be concerned about available fostering capacity in their area, they could identify potential fostering households that may be able to accommodate additional children. As part of their contingency planning, they may wish to consider where it would be appropriate and safe for some children (for example, siblings) to share bedrooms to increase the space available in fostering households.</p>

<p>They will need to have thorough, sensitive conversations with foster families and children as part of this planning. No foster carers should be expected to look after additional children without proper discussion and appropriate support. However, many will want to offer help and these families should be enabled to do so.</p>

<p>Fostering services could also consider whether foster carers who have recently stopped fostering as a result of personal or environmental factors, such as work pressures or retirement, could come back into the service temporarily, as long as they are not in high risk or vulnerable health groups and they are offered the necessary support to do so.</p>

<h3>Support for foster families</h3>

<p>In June, we launched FosterlinePlus, an extended service delivered by Fosterline, which offers free-to-access and specialist one-to-one support to foster families, in recognition of the additional support needed at this time to keep foster families together. Through this service, foster families can access to a range of specialist services, including behaviour management experts, independent social workers, advocacy services, plus fostering-specific tax and benefits services.</p>

<p>We are continuing to work with fostering services and sector organisations to better understand the specific challenges that foster carers are facing from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in order to ensure that the right level of support is put in place and to identify what other support might help foster families in the current time.</p>

<h4>Access to respite care</h4>

<p>Looked after children and their foster families can access respite care (short breaks), where it is needed to prevent potential placement breakdown or to provide some additional support to the family.</p>

<p>These provisions allow children to leave their foster home to stay with a respite carer, or for another carer to come into the fostering household to give the carer an opportunity to recharge.</p>

<p>We would encourage fostering services to consider how they can offer respite care safely during the coming weeks, whilst making every effort to manage the risks that contact between different households may present. This may be through existing support bubbles, community care models, or relationships between local carers, for example.</p>

<h2>Medical checks - fostering</h2>

<p>The temporary regulations allow fostering agencies to proceed to obtaining the information required under regulation 26(2)(a) of the Fostering Services (England) Regulations 2011 without having received medical reports.</p>

<p>The temporary regulations do not remove the need for medical reports as they still must be obtained before the fostering agency can consider the suitability assessment of the prospective foster carer and their household. A final decision cannot be made without a medical report being obtained and considered as part of the suitability assessment. If medical reports are available at the initial stage, they should still be obtained and considered then.</p>

<p>As good practice, agencies should let prospective foster carers know that if their application is progressed to the next stage, their medical information, when received, could affect the outcome. Equally, if agencies are aware of medical history that could affect the outcome of the application, they may decide not to progress the application until the relevant information has been received from the GP or other health professional.</p>

<p>The decision to use this flexibility must be recorded. Agencies may also find it helpful to keep a separate collated record of in which cases the flexibility has been used.</p>

<h3>Notifications – continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h3>

<p>For any notification received under regulation 3, 5 or 6 of the Children (Private Arrangements for Fostering) Regulations 2005 (the Private Fostering Regulations) before 25 September 2020, local authorities may act as though the amendments made by the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 were still in force. For notifications received on or after that date, the time limits in the Private Fostering Regulations apply.</p>

<h2>Adoption</h2>

<h3>Suitability assessments - continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h3>

<p>Where an adoption agency is in the process of assessing the suitability of a prospective adopter before 25 September 2020 under Part 4 of the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005, they must continue to assess that individual as though all the amendments made to the 2005 Regulations by the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, that came into effect from 24 April 2020, remain in force. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an adoption agency can decide if it refers the case to a panel for a recommendation on suitability</li>
  <li>a panel can still go ahead under reduced quoracy (not having enough members to carry out business and cast votes)</li>
  <li>an adoption agency can move to stage 2 of the process while still waiting for medicals and DBS checks
This is to avoid restarting the assessment process from the beginning for assessments in progress when the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 expired on 25 September 2020</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introductory meetings for children with new adopted parents</h3>

<p>Whilst we understand that introductory meetings will sometimes be challenging in the current circumstances, there needs to be a case by case, risk-based decision about what is right in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Face-to-face introductory meetings, such as adopters and foster carers visiting each other’s homes so the child(ren) can get to know the adopters before moving in with them, can continue to take place if it is possible to do so and if all parties are comfortable with the arrangements. Individuals should consider what is most appropriate in their specific circumstances.</p>

<p>We accept that for some children introductory meetings may have to be postponed for example, where someone in the foster family is in a vulnerable category and that other ways may need to be found to prioritise permanent placements for children in line with their best interests.</p>

<h3>Moving to stage 2 of adopter assessment process without medical reports</h3>

<p>The temporary regulations allow an adoption agency to proceed to stage 2 of the assessment process without having received the medical report, where applicable, requested under regulation 26(b) of the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005.</p>

<p>This does not remove the need for medical reports as they still must be obtained and considered before the adoption agency makes a final decision. If medical reports are available at stage 1, they should be obtained and considered then.</p>

<p>As good practice, agencies should let prospective adopters know that if their application is progressed to the next stage, their medical information, when received, could affect the outcome. Equally, if agencies are aware of medical history that could affect the outcome of the application, they may decide not to progress the application until the relevant information has been received from the GP or other health professional.</p>

<p>The decision to use this flexibility must be recorded. Agencies may also find it helpful to keep a separate collated record of in which cases the flexibility has been used.</p>

<p>The position under the new temporary regulations from 25 September 2020 is that a person cannot apply for a review to the Secretary of State of a decision that the person is not suitable for reasons related to medical information only.</p>

<h2>Residential provision: children’s homes, residential schools registered as children’s homes, and foster care</h2>

<h3>Keeping residential settings safe from coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>Local authorities and providers can refer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">safe working in education, childcare and children’s social care settings, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-workplace-guidance">NHS Test and Trace service in the workplace</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In considering how to keep residential settings safe from coronavirus (COVID-19) providers should recognise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that children may be feeling anxious as their normal routines are disrupted and they may have less or limited contact with their family, friends and people who are important to them</li>
  <li>that staff are working under challenging conditions and support them to continue to deliver the most appropriate care that they can. This could, for example, include, if possible, reducing the number of hours staff work in one shift, or providing more time away from the home</li>
  <li>the need to follow any social distancing guidelines where feasible and possible. Where possible, staff should ensure that food and other essential items are delivered. Within the home, frequently touched surfaces, including bathrooms, toilets and kitchens should be cleaned more often, and everyone should carry out more frequent handwashing. Towels used for hand-drying should be regularly changed</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a provider has an immediate or impending staffing shortage, which may lead to the closure of a home, they should discuss that as a matter of urgency with the relevant placing local authorities. Ofsted should also be notified, and they may share this information with DfE.</p>

<p>Social workers or police needing to visit a setting and investigate child protection concerns should make a judgement about visiting that balances considerations of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>risks to children and young people</li>
  <li>risks to families</li>
  <li>risks to the workforce</li>
  <li>guidance on social distancing and hygiene</li>
  <li>statutory responsibilities, including safeguarding</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective quality assurance checks and visits should continue to be carried out, to ensure that the care provided is safe and staff feel supported. Independent person visits under regulation 44 of the Children’s Homes (England) Regulations 2015 and face-to-face contact with families are still permitted and should still be prioritised. The use of virtual visits should be the exception and can be used as a result of public health advice or when it is not reasonably practical to have a face-to-face visit. Any activity carried out remotely should be recorded.</p>

<h3>Restricting a child’s movements if they become symptomatic or are confirmed as having coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>Anyone in England and Wales who has <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>, can now <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/ask-for-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link">ask for a test to check if you have coronavirus through the NHS website</a>.</p>

<p>If it is suspected or confirmed that a young person in residential care has become infected with coronavirus (COVID-19), it will be necessary for them to self-isolate.</p>

<p>If a child in a residential care home develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19):</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff can continue to enter and leave the home as required, but consistent staff rotas should be used where possible and staff should follow infection control procedures</li>
  <li>staff should wear <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">PPE for specific activities requiring close contact</a> - please be mindful that wearing a face covering may inhibit communication with people who rely on lip reading, facial expressions and clear sound</li>
  <li>staff should adhere to social distancing guidelines as far as they are able to, but should take account of children’s emotional needs</li>
</ul>

<p>All Ofsted registered children’s homes have been invited to join the National Testing Programme portal. This will allow those who register access to an initial batch of 10 home testing kits to hold on-site for use with any symptomatic children or staff, where there are barriers to accessing tests via the usual routes. Homes are able to order an additional batch every 21 days, where stocks run low.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-kits-for-childrens-homes">Coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits for children’s homes</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Local authorities and providers should discuss the care planning arrangements to determine whether the child can be safely cared for at their home (the children’s home), or whether alternative arrangements are required, for example, a temporary move to alternative provision, or a move of other children who are well to an alternative temporary placement. In all cases, we would hope that this could be done with the co-operation of the young person and their understanding of the significant risk of spreading infection.</p>

<p>Stability for children is paramount at this time, and we encourage providers to prioritise this when making decisions about whether symptomatic children should be moved. We are clear that a temporary move to an alternative placement should only ever be considered as a last resort. However, we understand that there may be significant health concerns relating to a symptomatic child or to another child in the home.</p>

<p>As far as possible, arrangements for restrictions should be put in place with the consent of the young person and all professionals involved in the care of the young person are encouraged to explain how and why the temporary restrictions are being applied. The restrictions should last for no longer than is necessary and must be kept under careful and constant review.</p>

<p>If the young person refuses to follow sensible public health guidance, as a last resort, advice can be sought from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) on the possibility of imposing restrictions on an individual who is potentially infectious under the Coronavirus Act 2020. This gives Public Health Officers power to impose proportionate requirements (including screening and isolation) on any person suspected or confirmed to be infected with coronavirus (COVID-19). Children and young people have the power to appeal the decision and should be given information about accessing advocacy support.</p>

<p>If decision makers agree that there is no alternative and the proposed restrictions are necessary and proportionate, then contact should be made with local health protection teams.</p>

<p>Contact information can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">find your local health protection team in England</a>.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on visitors and gatherings in residential settings</h3>

<p>Children’s homes will usually be considered as ‘households’. There are no restrictions on members of the same household meeting together, all the children in the home would still be able to gather together alongside the adults working at the home.</p>

<p>Your approach to deciding what constitutes a household and who should self-isolate because they are part of this household will depend on the physical layout of the residential setting, considering who shares a kitchen or bathroom, bedrooms and staffing arrangements. You can seek advice from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s local health protection teams if needed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">National lockdown: Stay at Home</a> guidance has introduced limits on people gathering indoors or outdoors. However, there are exceptions to enable people to meet, such as for work or the provision of voluntary or charitable services, if you cannot reasonably do so from home. This means, for example, that social workers and independent visitors under regulation 44 of the Children’s Homes (England) Regulations 2015 can continue to visit children.</p>

<p>The exceptions also allow for contact between parents and children where children do not live in the same household as both their parents, and for contact between siblings when they do not live together and one or more of them is a looked after child or a 16 or 17 year-old care leaver.</p>

<h3>Virtual visits - children’s homes</h3>

<p>The temporary regulations allow meetings taking place under regulation 22(1) of the Children’s Homes (England) Regulations 2015 to take place over the telephone, a video link or other electronic means. Suitable facilities are to be made available within the children’s home to enable such private meetings to take place.</p>

<p>As good practice, children and young people should be told why a face-to-face visit is not possible and be advised of their right to advocacy.</p>

<p>The use of virtual visits should be the exception and can be used as a result of public health advice or when it is not reasonably practicable to have a face-to-face visit otherwise for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). This could include during national restrictions, self-isolation or social distancing advice due to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>All uses of this temporary flexibility must be recorded, for example in individual case records, and those records should include the reasons why a virtual visit was necessary. Providers may also find it helpful to keep a separate collated record in which cases the flexibility has been used.</p>

<h3>Managing a young person’s behaviour if they are not complying with social distancing guidelines in residential provision (children’s homes and foster care)</h3>

<p>We appreciate how difficult understanding and following social distancing guidelines can be for children. If a young person is not complying with social distancing guidelines, the response should be considered on a case by case basis. In the first instance, we would encourage those who know these young people best, to continue to engage with them on this issue, including residential care staff, foster carers or social workers.</p>

<p>Where this is a persistent problem for those responsible for the child or young person, they should discuss with the child’s responsible authority to develop a plan to encourage the child to comply. Providers should also support those who are caring for the child to find alternative ways and/or incentives to encourage children to comply with the overall restrictions in place at the time. Restraint should not be used to ensure children and young people comply with social distancing measures.</p>

<p>Ofsted has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-environments-where-children-can-flourish">guidance about physical intervention and restrictions of liberty</a>.</p>

<h2>Placement – continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h2>

<p>Where the responsible authority has, under regulation 19 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, placed a child before 25 September 2020 with the child’s parent, someone with parental responsibility for the child or someone named in a child arrangements order as a person with whom the child was meant to live, the 2010 Regulations will continue to apply to the placement as if all the amendments made to them remain in force. That means that the assessment of suitability and review of the child’s case in accordance with regulation 17 can still be completed as soon as reasonably practicable from the start of the placement.</p>

<p>Where placements under regulation 19 are made on or after 25 September 2020, the responsible authority must comply with the original regulatory provisions and ensure that the assessment of suitability and review of the child’s case is completed within 10 working days from the start of the placement.</p>

<p>Emergency placements under regulation 23 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review Regulations 2010 that were made before 25 September 2020 should be reviewed to see if they remain appropriate. They can continue to last for up to 24 weeks in accordance with the amendments made by the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020. Placements made on or after this date must comply with regulation 23 of the 2010 Regulations and must not last for longer than 6 working days.</p>

<h3>Short breaks – continuing effect of the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Regulations 2020</h3>

<p>Children who remain in a short break placement which started before 25 September may continue in that placement as long as the placements do not exceed 75 days in a 12-month period. The 2010 Regulations and the 2011 Regulations will continue to apply with the modifications listed at regulation 48(3) of the 2010 Regulations and regulation 42(3) of the 2011 Regulations.</p>

<p>For placements beginning on or after 25 September the original provisions apply and the length of any one placement will be limited to 17 days, with overall placements to not exceed 75 days in a 12-month period. The 2010 Regulations and 2011 Regulations will go back to also applying with the listed modifications to these placements.</p>

<h2>Residential family centres</h2>

<h3>Face-to-face contact in residential family centres</h3>

<p>The temporary regulations allow interviews with residents and staff at the residential family centre that are carried out by the registered provider in accordance with regulation 25(4)(a) of the Residential Family Centres Regulations 2002 to take place over the telephone, a video link or via other electronic communication methods.</p>

<p>The use of virtual interviews should be the exception and can be used as a result of public health advice or when it is not reasonably practicable to have a face-to-face visit otherwise for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19). This could include during periods of national restrictions, self-isolation or social distancing advice due to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>All uses of this temporary flexibility must be recorded, for example in individual case records, and those records should include the reasons why a virtual interview was necessary. Providers may also find it helpful to keep a separate collated record of in which cases the flexibility has been used.</p>

<h2>Care leavers</h2>

<h3>Responsibilities to care leavers</h3>

<p>We recognise that care leavers are a particularly vulnerable group of young people. Coronavirus (COVID-19) heightens this, because care leavers may be financially vulnerable and at risk of increased levels of anxiety and isolation.</p>

<p>Local authorities must continue to meet their statutory responsibilities towards care leavers, such as providing personal advisers, or preparing and reviewing pathway plans. Personal advisers should proactively reach out to care leavers during the pandemic, including care leavers aged over 21 who are eligible for support up to age 25, but who were not accessing support before the pandemic.</p>

<p>Local authorities should be clear about what additional support is available to care leavers - over and above their existing published local offer - to help them overcome any additional challenges they face due to coronavirus (COVID-19), including access to discretionary funding if needed.</p>

<p>The government has provided additional funding for local authorities to help them address pressures arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). We would encourage local authorities to utilise some of this funding to provide discretionary payments to care leavers to cover items such as food, utilities and rent during this period if required.</p>

<p>Given the financial vulnerability of many care leavers during this period, local authorities should make arrangements for discretionary payments to be authorised and paid to care leavers at short notice if necessary and with minimal administrative burdens. Other forms of financial support for care leavers including setting up home allowances should continue to be available during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<h3>Personal advisers</h3>

<p>We encourage personal advisers to keep in touch with young people in the most effective way for the individual young person, including through technology such as phone or video. Face-to-face visits will be necessary to provide the right help to some young people, and these should continue, taking account of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes">Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> to protect staff and the care leavers they are visiting.</p>

<p>Personal advisers should carefully assess what is the right level and frequency of contact with each care leaver, taking into account each young person’s particular circumstances and levels of vulnerability. They should always consider the individual wishes and feelings of care leavers.</p>

<h3>Independent living</h3>

<p>Young people who have left care, or are just about to, are especially vulnerable right now. All decisions about their future should be carefully considered in the light of the pandemic and with an overriding objective of supporting them during this period and minimising any additional stress for them. In particular, we expect local authorities to take account of coronavirus (COVID-19) when making decisions about leaving care, and to ensure that no one has to leave care during this period. As set out in regulation <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/959/regulation/39/made">39 of the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010</a>, when considering ceasing to look after a young person, local authorities should carry out an assessment, including ascertaining and giving consideration to the young person’s wishes and feelings. The same principle should apply to young people who are in staying put arrangements and in relation to decisions about care leavers who were due to make a planned move into new accommodation.</p>

<p>While young people will still be able to move out of care into suitable accommodation, where this happens the move should be right for that young person and take account of their wishes and feelings.
Care leavers can also be moved between different accommodation settings, provided that the move is in accordance with the wishes of the young person and that the local authority is assured that the setting they are moving into is safe in relation to risk factors arising from coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<h3>Loneliness and isolation of care leavers</h3>

<p>During the summer term, devices were provided to local authorities and academy trusts to support families, children and young people most in need who did not have access to them through another source, such as their school. Laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers were provided for care leavers, children and young people with social workers and disadvantaged year 10 pupils.</p>

<p>The government has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing">guidance on supporting children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing</a>. We have also provided funding for 3 care leaver charities (Become, Drive Forward Foundation and the Care Leaver’s Association) to provide extra support to help care leavers to reduce loneliness and isolation and their impact on young people’s emotional health and well-being.</p>

<h2>Mental health of looked-after children and care leavers</h2>

<h3>Support for the mental health of looked-after children and care leavers</h3>

<p>Local authorities as corporate parents have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children they look after including their physical, emotional and mental health. Local authorities and their health partners must work together during this time to ensure that the health needs of looked-after children continue to be met. The statutory <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-the-health-and-wellbeing-of-looked-after-children--2" class="govuk-link">guidance on promoting the health and wellbeing of looked-after children</a> sets out the duties and expectations for local authorities, clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) and NHS England in supporting the health of looked-after children, including children placed out of authority.</p>

<p>Where looked-after children are placed outside of their current <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> area during this time, arrangements should continue to be made through discussion between the ‘originating <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>’, those currently providing healthcare and new providers to ensure continuity of healthcare. <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> should ensure that any changes in the healthcare provider do not disrupt the objective of providing high quality, timely care. The needs of the child should be the first consideration.</p>

<p>There will be particular issues arising from coronavirus (COVID-19) that will affect looked-after children, for example, changes to contact with birth families. Local authorities should be alert to these issues and the impact they may have on looked-after children’s mental health and wellbeing. Local authorities should continue to encourage looked-after children to speak to their social worker, carer or other trusted adult about how they are feeling and any mental health and wellbeing needs they have so that they can ensure they get the help and support they need.</p>

<p>Social workers may also want to make carers aware of Public Health England’s general <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-parents-and-carers-on-supporting-children-and-young-peoples-mental-health-and-wellbeing-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" class="govuk-link">guidance for parents and carers on supporting children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>. and NHS England’s general <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/looking-after-children-and-young-people-during-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on looking after children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>. Both sets of guidance also contain helplines and websites which children and young people can access directly, including for anonymous support. Public Health England <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Every Mind Matters</a> contains useful information for young people and carers on how to look after their own or someone else’s mental health.</p>

<p>Additionally, Become has a dedicated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://becomecharity.org.uk/for-young-people/care-advice-line/coronavirus-advice/" rel="external">Care Advice Line</a> for looked-after children and care leavers.</p>

<p>Mental health continues to be a priority for the NHS and the NHS remains open to support everyone. NHS funded services across the statutory, independent and voluntary community and social enterprise sectors have worked with partners including education, local authorities, public health agencies and the justice system throughout the pandemic to help ensure that children and young people can get the support they need. This includes the use of e-clinics, online video calls or apps which enable children and young people to self-refer and talk to services through their mobile devices. 24/7 all ages crisis helplines are available across the country so anyone, including children and young people, can get urgent help whenever they need it. NHS England has published <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/community-social-care-ambulance/mental-health/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance for services on mental health, learning disabilities and autism</a>.</p>

<h2>Unaccompanied asylum seeking children (<abbr title="unaccompanied asylum seeking children">UASC</abbr>)</h2>

<h2>Self-isolation</h2>

<p>Where an unaccompanied-asylum seeking child (<abbr title="unaccompanied asylum seeking children">UASC</abbr>) arrives in England, the local authority receiving them will need to ensure that they are placed in suitable accommodation in isolation from other people for 10 days, in line with  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to self-isolate when you travel to England</a>. This includes details on exemption rules and the position regarding transit stops. All newly arriving <abbr title="unaccompanied asylum seeking children">UASC</abbr> will need to be tested on or before day 2, and on or after day 8 of their quarantine.</p>

<p>As regards making provisions for isolation, local authorities should note that the regulations state that for a child, any person who has custody or charge of the child during the period of self-isolation must ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the child self-isolates in accordance with this regulation (The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 reg4(11)).</p>

<p>If an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child is symptomatic of coronavirus (COVID-19) on or after arrival, the local authority with responsibility for them ought to take further steps to place them in isolation in accordance with the self-isolation <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage local authorities to engage with their existing service providers. Local authorities can also source accommodation through central government Crown Commercial Services, supported by Calder Conferences and Corporate Travel Management Limited (CTM).</p>

<p>Both CTM and Calder Conferences provide 24/7 services, and both aim to respond with options within 24 hours. Due to the nature of the requests Calder Conferences handle (large scale/block booking or exclusive use), they may occasionally require longer than 24 hours, but they will inform the local authority if this is the case. Local authorities may refer to the <a href="https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/finding-temporary-accommodation-during-covid-19" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on finding temporary accommodation during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> for details on how to use these services.</p>

<h3>Legal responsibility for <abbr title="unaccompanied asylum seeking children">UASC</abbr> in self-isolation accommodation</h3>

<p>As with any spontaneous arrival, the local authority that initially collects the child (for example, from the police station or from Border Force) should assess the child’s needs as they would do in normal circumstances. The local authority must find suitable accommodation for the young person and if the child is accommodated for more than 24 hours by that local authority, they will be responsible for the child as a ‘looked-after child’.</p>

<h2>Courts</h2>

<h3>Courts during coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>We are working hard across government and with the judiciary to make sure that the family justice system continues to operate during this unprecedented time. In March 2020, the Family Courts issued <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-and-guidance/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on moving towards delivering remote hearings</a>. In June, the President of the Family Division also published <a rel="external" href="https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/the-family-court-and-covid-19-the-road-ahead" class="govuk-link">The Road Ahead</a> which establishes a broad framework for Family Courts and the hearing of cases in the coming months.</p>

<h3>Court orders related to contact for children in care</h3>

<p>We expect that contact between children in care and their birth relatives will continue. It is essential for children and families to remain in touch at this difficult time, and for many children, the consequences of not seeing relatives would be traumatic. We expect the spirit of any court-ordered contact in relation to children in care to be maintained. However, there may be local or individual circumstances where face-to-face contact may not be possible, including where members of households are isolating or continuing to take precautions due to clinical vulnerability.</p>

<p>Contact arrangements should, therefore, be assessed on a case by case basis taking into account a range of factors, including the government’s current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing-after-4-july">social distancing guidance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/meeting-people-from-outside-your-household-from-4-july">guidance on meeting people outside your household</a> and the needs of the child.</p>

<p>Under the current provisions for social distancing, there are exceptions for the purposes of arrangements for access to, and contact between, parents and children where the children do not live in the same household as their parents or one of their parents. There is also an exception to allow for contact between siblings when they do not live together and one or more of them is a looked after child or a 16 or 17-year-old care leaver.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible for the usual face-to-face contact to happen, keeping in touch will need to continue to take place virtually. We would encourage social workers and other professionals to reassure children that this position is temporary. We would also expect foster parents and other carers to be consulted on how best to meet the needs of the children in their care and to be supported to facilitate that contact.</p>

<p>We recognise that some young children may not be able to benefit from virtual contact with their family, because of their age or other communication challenges. In these circumstances, local authorities should work with families to ensure that they can have safe face-to-face interactions, whilst still adhering to social distancing guidance or restrictions.</p>

<p>When considering the most appropriate ways for children to stay in touch with their families, social workers and carers should seek the views of children who may welcome different forms of contact, including less formal and more flexible virtual contact with their birth families.</p>

<h2>Workforce</h2>

<h3>Bringing social workers back into frontline practice</h3>

<p>In collaboration with the Local Government Association (LGA) and Social Work England, we have the <a rel="external" href="https://www.socialworkengland.org.uk/news/social-work-together/" class="govuk-link">Social Work Together</a> campaign to help employers in need of additional social workers to get in touch with those who feel they can contribute. Social workers can register their interest via the <a href="http://www.local.gov.uk/social-work-together" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Local Government Association website</a>.</p>

<p>Social Work England has also written to all social workers who have left the profession in the last two years, setting out the process for re-registering and how they can help in these unprecedented times.
Local authorities can access the details of interested social workers through the LGA website local authority registration page.</p>

<h3>DBS checks for social workers returning to the profession</h3>

<p>Social workers, and others, brought in for coronavirus (COVID-19) purposes are eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-of-charge-dbs-applications-and-fast-track-barred-list-check-service">free, fast-tracked DBS checks</a>.</p>

<h3>Quality of social workers returning to the profession</h3>

<p>Anyone who has had a fitness to practise case upheld will not be re-registered. Local authorities will be required to undertake their usual employment checks.</p>

<h2>Ofsted</h2>

<h3>Ofsted inspections</h3>

<p>Ofsted’s regulatory role and work is continuing, and it has taken a range of actions to ensure that it is responding proportionately to the current context. Ofsted is providing regular updates to educational and children’s social care settings and local authorities on its approach to key issues.</p>

<p>The suspension of the minimum intervals for inspection of children’s homes, residential family centres, voluntary adoption agencies, adoption support agencies, fostering agencies and holiday schemes for disabled children will now continue until 31 March 2021.  A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/children2019s-home-team/adoption-and-children-coronavirus-amendment-regula/" rel="external">public consultation on whether to extend this temporary suspension</a> was launched on 9 February and ran until 28 February 2021.</p>

<p>During the period of continued suspension, Ofsted will continue to monitor and visit social care providers using a risk-based approach in order to ensure that children’s safety is a priority.</p>

<p>Ofsted will arrange visits based on the most recent inspection judgements, other information it holds about the provider, the amount of time since the last inspection and whether the provider is newly registered and therefore not yet been inspected.</p>

<p>During this period, if there are concerns raised about a provider, Ofsted retains the ability to maintain oversight and to undertake any necessary regulatory action.</p>

<p>Further information is available in Ofsted’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif" class="govuk-link">guidance on social care common inspection framework and assurance visits</a>. In addition, Ofsted will undertake focused visits to local authorities using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-local-authority-childrens-services-from-2018" class="govuk-link">framework for inspecting local authority services (ILASC)</a>.</p>
