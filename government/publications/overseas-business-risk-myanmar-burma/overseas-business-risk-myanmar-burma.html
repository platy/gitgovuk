<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Political</h2>

<p>On 1 February 2021, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing, the Head of Myanmar’s Armed Forces (the Tatmadaw), staged a coup d’état and overthrew the democratically elected civilian government led by the National League for Democracy (NLD). State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint have been detained alongside a wide range of political prisoners. The opposition National Unity Government (NUG) has been formed by members of the former parliament.</p>

<p>A series of protests followed the coup alongside a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) focused on restricting the Junta’s control of vital services, particularly through peaceful strikes and a domestic boycott of military linked companies. This, alongside decisions made by the Junta, has impacted the public and private sector bringing severe disruption to basic services such as banking, health and transportation.</p>

<p>Political tension and unrest are widespread since the coup and general levels of violence have risen. Protests have become increasingly sporadic in order to avoid security forces. There has been an increased use of small explosive and arson attacks against targets such as buildings controlled by the Myanmar Security Forces.</p>

<p>Increasingly organised violence is being seen across Myanmar, including in ethnic minority states in the east of the country and along the border with Thailand. The general situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://aappb.org/" rel="external">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</a> produces daily reports on the situation and statistics on the numbers killed, arrested and detained.</p>

<p>On 24 April, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) issued a five-point consensus calling for an immediate cessation to violence, access to humanitarian aid and for mediated dialogue between all parties concerned.</p>

<p>Myanmar remains beset by multiple conflicts in ethnic areas which has resulted in a significant and protracted humanitarian situation in the border regions. The Myanmar Security Forces are responsible for serious human rights violations across the country and a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Rakhine State. 
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/myanmarffm/pages/index.aspx" rel="external">UN Independent Fact Finding Mission</a> has produced a number of reports which document the actions of the Myanmar Security Forces.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) advises against all but essential travel to Myanmar, based on recent political events and the current assessment of the COVID-19 risk. More information on political risk, including political demonstrations, is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar">FCDO Travel Advice</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Economic</h2>

<p>In 2019 Myanmar was the 71st largest economy in the world (World Bank, 2019) but it remains the poorest country in South East Asia with 1 in 4 people living in poverty. However, since 2011, economic reform has lifted 11.8 million people out of poverty and raised living standards. Between 2010 and 2017 mobile phone ownership increased from 4.8% to 81.5% and households using electricity for lighting increased from 23% to 69%. Average growth rates 2011 – 2019 were 6.5% with GDP standing at $76 billion in 2019 (World Bank).</p>

<p>Pre-coup, COVID-19 had already started to hit the economy hard. Growth fell from 6.8% in 2018 to just 1.7% in 2019 as the garment, tourism and retail sectors experienced significant slowdowns with implications for the poorest in society. The NLD Government launched an economic response to inject fiscal stimulus and fast-track structural reforms building upon the 140 significant economic reforms and 500 supporting regulatory reforms implemented since 2011.</p>

<p>The significant deterioration in the political situation alongside COVID-19 is increasingly expected to lead to an economic collapse. The World Bank have indicated that initial projections of a 10% contraction in the 2020-21 fiscal year are optimistic with independent analysts projecting up to a 20% contraction.</p>

<p>Virtually all sectors of the private sector, public services and Civil Service are severely stressed or stalled as the CDM continues and the economy declines. Access to banking services is severely restricted with individuals having withdrawals capped. Logistics have ground to a halt with ports facing significant bottlenecks and significant staff shortages in road and rail transportation due to ongoing strikes.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are seeing severe contractions in orders alongside increasing costs due to transport costs, material shortages and the continued depreciation of the kyat which is subsequently increasing the price of fuel and food. The economic shock is likely to have a significant effect on the country’s poorest and most vulnerable with the World Food Programme estimating that lost jobs and remittances are likely to make 1.5 million people food insecure in 3 months, increasing to 3.4 million in 6 months.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Sanctions</h2>

<p>The UK Government, alongside international partners, have imposed financial, trade and immigration sanctions in respect of Myanmar. The UK’s autonomous sanctions regime is established by the Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021 (“the Regulations”), which have replaced the Burma (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Further information and guidance is available regarding the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-relating-to-myanmar">UK’s sanctions regime relating to Myanmar</a>.</p>

<p>Since the coup, the UK Government has announced a range of sanction designations targeting the military junta. The designated persons include: the State Administration Council; the military linked conglomerates Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC); and 3 state owned entities, namely,  Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE), Myanmar Pearl Enterprise (MPE) and Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE).</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-sanctions-guidance/myanmar-sanctions-guidance">full guidance on the trade, immigration and financial sanctions</a>. Businesses should review the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-sanctions-list">UK Sanctions List</a> which identifies entities and individuals designated under the Regulations, and details of the sanctions regimes in respect of which they have been designated.</p>

<p>The Regulations apply to conduct in the United Kingdom or in the territorial sea by any person, and to UK persons (a United Kingdom national, or a body incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the United Kingdom) worldwide.</p>

<p>As regards finance, the Regulations prohibit a person knowingly, or with reasonable cause to suspect, from: dealing with funds or economic resources owned, held or controlled by a designated person; making funds available directly or indirectly to a designated person; making funds available to any person for the benefit of a designated person; making economic resources available directly or indirectly to a designated person; and making economic resources available to any person for the benefit of a designated person.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is prohibited intentionally to participate in activities knowing that the object or effect of them is, whether directly or indirectly, to circumvent any of the above financial prohibitions, or to enable or facilitate the contravention of any such prohibition.</p>

<p>As regards trade, the export prohibition in the Regulations covers export to and for use in Myanmar. This means that, even if the initial destination is not Myanmar, the prohibition may still apply. Exporters should check the ultimate end use of goods and may apply for a licence or contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/export-control-organisation">Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU)</a> if they know or think the items may be used in Myanmar.</p>

<p>The Regulations currently impose trade restrictions on military goods and technology, on dual-use goods and technology, and on specified goods and technology which may be used to repress the civilian population in Myanmar. It also imposes further trade restrictions in respect of the provision of interception and monitoring services to, or for the benefit of, the Government of Myanmar, or the provision of certain services, funds or armed personnel to, or for the benefit of, the Tatmadaw (i.e. the Myanmar Armed Forces). “For military use” is defined in the export prohibition in the UK Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021.</p>

<p>A sanctions licence is not required for exports of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from Northern Ireland to an EU Member State where the final destination is Myanmar. You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the onward export to Myanmar. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK export control legislation as applicable.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Business and Human Rights</h2>

<p>The UK Government is clear in its opposition to the coup and are pushing for the restoration of democracy, the protection of rights and freedoms and unobstructed humanitarian access.</p>

<p>In association with our allies and partners, the UK Government has tailored its response to the coup and sought to impose a cost on the military while protecting the poorest and most vulnerable. We recognise that the complete collapse of the economy will significantly impact the most vulnerable, destabilise the wider region and cause issues for years to come. International trade and investment have a key role to play in poverty reduction, economic development and the prevention of oligopolies in markets thereby providing the citizens of Myanmar choices.</p>

<p>Businesses should be aware that the commercial interests of the Myanmar Security Forces, and associated individuals, are wide-ranging. Businesses operating in Myanmar should remain aware of developments in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-sanctions-guidance/myanmar-sanctions-guidance">relevant sanctions</a>.</p>

<p>If procuring natural resources from Myanmar, particularly teak, businesses should be aware of sanctions and should ensure they conduct thorough supply chain due diligence to ensure that they are not supporting the military or its associated businesses.</p>

<p>We recommend that gem importers conduct thorough supply chain due diligence to ensure that they are not supporting the military or its associated businesses, even if their supply chain seems to be outside of Myanmar. Ruby, jade and pearl exports are known to be heavily controlled and associated with the military and may enter into the UK market through other countries.</p>

<p>The Myanmar military regularly uses air strikes against civilian targets. If dealing with any entity linked to Myanmar’s aviation sector, businesses should conduct thorough supply chain diligence to ensure that commodities such as jet-fuel do not reach the military.</p>

<p>The UK Government has undertaken an extensive consultation with Civil Society and UK businesses trading with Myanmar and has determined the following issues are of most concern to UK businesses.</p>

<h3>Continuing business operations in Myanmar</h3>

<p>In line with the UK Government’s objective to protect the most vulnerable and to encourage market diversification, we advise that UK businesses currently operating in Myanmar may continue to do so while the political, economic and societal environment allows and that businesses should comply with standards of responsible business conduct, including respecting human rights. They will also need to ensure they are taking account of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/myanmar">FCDO Travel Advice</a>. The UK Government is clear that UK businesses must fully comply with relevant sanctions and not enter relationships that benefit the military.</p>

<p>We also encourage all businesses operating in Myanmar to assess the impact of a potential withdrawal from the market in line with United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Please refer to our guidance on due diligence below.</p>

<h3>Responding to workforce concerns and human rights violations and abuses</h3>

<p>The UK Government is seriously concerned about the increasing human rights violations being observed in Myanmar. Businesses should work closely with their suppliers and partners to ensure that the safety, security and wellbeing of their workforce is a primary concern and that employers are respectful of individual rights, including the right to protest. We encourage businesses to retain workers undertaking lawful and peaceful protest wherever possible and to remain compliant with their terms of employment, including not to dismiss workers for taking part in peaceful protest.</p>

<p>The UK has ratified all 8 of the fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, including CO87 (Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise) and CO98 (Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining) and we expect businesses to ensure they and their suppliers and partners are compliant with these conventions. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/mneguidelines/" rel="external">OECD</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---multi/documents/publication/wcms_094386.pdf" rel="external">International Labour Organisation</a> have issued guidelines for multinational enterprises  on responsible business conduct including regarding these conventions. More information and advice on the OECD guidelines can be sought from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-national-contact-point">UK National Contact Point</a>.</p>

<p>The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar is collecting evidence of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://iimm.un.org/" rel="external">most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar</a> since 2011, this includes violations since the 1 February 2021.  We encourage businesses to report any observed human rights violations or abuses to the IIMM.</p>

<h3>Remaining compliant with sanctions for the transit of goods</h3>

<p>Businesses should work with logistics partners to undertake all practical efforts to minimise exposure to military owned supply chains and ports. Some information on subsidiaries and affiliate companies of MEHL and MEC can be found in the 2019 United Nations report detailing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/MyanmarFFM/Pages/EconomicInterestsMyanmarMilitary.aspx" rel="external">economic interests of the Myanmar military</a>. However, this is not an exhaustive list and it is up to businesses to conduct their own due diligence.</p>

<p>Making funds or economic resources available to, or for the benefit of, a designated person (directly or indirectly), without a licence or valid exception, is prohibited under financial sanctions legislation.</p>

<p>The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs">guidance</a> including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948298/OFSI_Guidance_-_Import_and_export.pdf" rel="external">specific FAQ guidance for importers and exporters</a>. Any suspected breaches of financial sanctions should be <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/suspected-breach-of-financial-sanctions-what-to-do">reported to OFSI</a>.</p>

<h3>Paying taxes and other fees</h3>
<p>Businesses should remain compliant with the laws of Myanmar unless these violate relevant sanctions, international law or are illegal under the UK Bribery Act (see Section 5 below) or other UK laws. In all cases we recommend businesses seek independent legal advice.</p>

<h3>Selling goods and services via third parties</h3>
<p>Businesses with supply chain links to Myanmar face reputational, economic and legal risks and should ensure that third parties are aware of their own legal obligations and international frameworks such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/mneguidelines/" rel="external">OECD guidelines</a>. Businesses trading in goods or services outlined in Chapter 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-sanctions-guidance/myanmar-sanctions-guidance">UK sanctions guidance</a> should consider seeking legal advice noting that even if the immediate destination is not Myanmar, the prohibition may still apply.</p>

<p>In general businesses should consider the reputational and legal risks of goods or services being linked to, or utilised by, the Myanmar Security Forces and work to limit supplies through third party distributors accordingly.</p>

<h3>Conducting safety critical maintenance on equipment linked to Myanmar Security Forces</h3>

<p>Businesses seeking to trade with sanctioned entities (i.e. “designated persons”) should be aware of the technical assistance provisions contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myanmar-sanctions-guidance/myanmar-sanctions-guidance">UK sanctions guidance</a> and should consider Chapter 3 regarding authorisation and licencing for a sanctioned activity.</p>

<p>Applications for trade sanctions licences can be made through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/spire/fox/espire/LOGIN/login" rel="external">SPIRE</a>. Enquiries for applications for certain items and services that are not processed on SPIRE can be made to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tradesanctions@trade.gov.uk">tradesanctions@trade.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Financial sanctions are distinct from trade sanctions and Chapter 6 of the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) general guidance deals specifically with exceptions and licensing. The guidance covers the most common exceptions relating to financial sanctions as set out in legislation.</p>

<p>A licence is written permission from OFSI permitting an act that would otherwise be prohibited under sanctions regulations. A licence from OFSI does not compel any party to undertake any transaction. Further information on OFSI licencing, as well as compliance and enforcement and the OFSI consolidated list of financial sanctions targets, can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation">www.gov.uk/ofsi</a>. Completed licence application forms and queries can be submitted to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk">ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk</a>. OFSI prioritises urgent and humanitarian cases, i.e. cases that involve a risk of harm or threat to life. In all cases OFSI recommends applicants seek independent legal advice.</p>

<p>In all cases we recommend businesses consider seeking independent legal advice.</p>

<h3>Remaining compliant with sanctions if facilities are built on land owned by sanctioned entities and individuals</h3>

<p>OFSI will consider licensing activities that fall within the licensing grounds set out in the legislation. These licences, however, cannot be issued retrospectively so if an entity has carried out an act that required a licence, without having obtained one beforehand, they may have breached financial sanctions and should consult Chapters 5 and 7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs">OFSI’s general guidance</a> immediately.</p>

<p>You should consider whether a designated person owns or controls (directly or indirectly) any relevant land that relates to the payment of ground rent.</p>

<p>UK businesses should conduct thorough due diligence on land ownership before entering into a contract to avoid providing financial support to the Myanmar Security Forces or their associated businesses.</p>

<h3>Remaining compliant with sanctions imposed by other nations such as the United States or European Union</h3>
<p>If you have queries about sanctions imposed by the US or other states, you should consult relevant national guidance and legislation. You may also wish to take legal advice, as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Guidance regarding due diligence</h3>
<p>Businesses are ultimately responsible for conducting due diligence regarding their engagement and operations within Myanmar and should seek legal advice to ensure compliance with relevant sanctions, law and standards, as well as undertaking appropriate risk assessments.</p>

<p>The UK Government expects businesses to work with businesses that follow best practice on responsible business, including respecting human rights in Myanmar and to not enter or continue contracts, rent from or purchase from private sector entities that do not meet such standards.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/" rel="external">OECD has produced guidelines</a> for multinational enterprises and on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oecd.org/investment/due-diligence-guidance-for-responsible-business-conduct.htm" rel="external">due diligence</a>. The UK Government also encourages businesses to implement the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf" rel="external">United Nations Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)</a>. Since the whole of Myanmar can be considered a conflict-affected and high-risk area, businesses should conduct ongoing and heightened due diligence.</p>

<p>Businesses should be aware that under section 54 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/contents/enacted" rel="external">Modern Slavery Act 2015</a>, certain businesses with a turnover of £36 million or more are required to produce modern slavery statements during each financial year setting out the steps they have taken to tackle modern slavery in their supply chains and any other part of its own business.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span> Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bribery-act-2010-guidance">Bribery Act</a> applies to non-UK companies operating in the United Kingdom, and to UK companies working overseas. It created 4 prime offences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>two general offences covering the offering, promising or giving of an advantage, and requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting of an advantage</li>
  <li>an offence of bribing a foreign public official</li>
  <li>a new offence of failure by a commercial organisation to prevent a bribe being paid to obtain or retain business or a business advantage (should an offence be committed, it will be a defence that the organisation has adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Act recognises that no bribery prevention regime will be capable of preventing bribery at all times. A company will have a full defence if it can show that despite a particular case of bribery it nevertheless had adequate procedures in place to prevent persons associated with it from bribing. Companies must therefore make sure that they have strong, up-to-date and effective anti-bribery policies and systems in place to prevent bribery by persons associated with them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>	Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Myanmar is a country with limited support for intellectual property (IP) rights as IP laws remain unimplemented.
The UK government’s advice globally is that it is essential to register your rights as soon as possible in order to be able to defend and enforce them. IP rights are territorial in nature which means that registrations in the UK or another country’s jurisdiction are not automatically enforceable in others.</p>

<p>Myanmar is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). However, Myanmar is not a signatory to any conventions.</p>

<p>The IPO has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-overseas-intellectual-property-attache-network/attache-contact-details">attachés based in Singapore</a> providing IP business support to UK companies operating across Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The IPO has information on protecting your intellectual property overseas.</p>

<p>Further information on the local IP system can be found at the Myanmar IPO website.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span> Useful information</h2>

<p>The Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business (MCRB), an independent not-for-profit organisation based in Yangon, publishes guidance for companies to assist their human rights due diligence in Myanmar. MCRB also publish an annual report, produces an annual report <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.myanmar-responsiblebusiness.org/pwint-thit-sa/2020.html" rel="external">“Pwint Thit Sa”</a>, which benchmarks the disclosure practices of large Myanmar companies. This independent guidance may be useful for due diligence on local business partners; however, businesses should make final conclusions based on their own assessment.</p>
