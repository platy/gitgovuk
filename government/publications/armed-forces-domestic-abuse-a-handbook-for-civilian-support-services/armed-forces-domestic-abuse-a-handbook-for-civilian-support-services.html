<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Foreword</h3>

<p>This Handbook is designed to help and inform UK based civilian support services who are
working with armed forces families affected by domestic abuse. The information within this
Handbook is armed forces specific but it is essential that practitioners consider both military
and civilian support options in order to ensure that families are able to access the most
appropriate support for their individual needs. This Handbook should be read in conjunction
with generic domestic abuse information. It is recognised that the majority of practitioners
who use this Handbook will be experienced in supporting those affected by domestic abuse,
although to ensure it has utility across all support services, generic working practices within
the field of domestic abuse are referred to.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Background</h3>

<p>The UK Armed Forces community is a reflection of a wider society within which domestic abuse
is not uncommon. It is inevitable that domestic abuse occurs within the armed forces, and it
is therefore important to understand the dynamics within this community that can add to the
vulnerability of victims. Some unique factors that often affect families within the Armed
Forces community are outlined below. These factors can place additional pressures on
families and may contribute to an individual’s concerns when they are in, or seeking to leave,
an abusive relationship and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>economic dependence on the serving person is increased due to good job security and military benefits such as Service Family Accommodation (<abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>). These benefits are linked to the serving person and are very valuable to young families</li>
  <li>regular postings can make it difficult for a spouse to maintain a career which can diminish their own employability and financial independence. As a result, it is not uncommon for couples to rely on a single income and experience financial hardship</li>
  <li>military commitments can lead to long and frequent periods of separation with the partner who is left at home taking on additional roles. This can necessitate significant readjustment by the whole family when the absent partner returns. Long periods of separation can foster distrust, and children born during separation can also place additional strain on families and relationships</li>
  <li>regular assignments to new locations can isolate victims from wider family support as well as local civilian support services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the armed forces community there is little to separate professional and personal
lives. For example, individuals who work together will often also be neighbours. Unmarried
personnel often live in single living accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>), and may be living in the same
accommodation block as an abusive partner for example. Military personnel may also fulfil
the role of medical staff and welfare support workers. With such close links within the Armed
Forces community the worry of unwanted repercussions is often a significant concern to
victims. Of even greater concern is the threat that the perpetrator may lose their job if the
victim reports the abuse, with a family potentially facing significant loss of earnings as well
as military benefits such as housing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Multi-Agency Working</h3>

<p>Due to the unique lifestyle and employment of armed forces personnel, they and their
families have access to specialist military welfare support services, as well as civilian
support services. There is a need to ensure that civilian support services and the Armed
Forces welfare support network work closely together to ensure the needs of those affected
by domestic abuse are fully met. Both military and civilian services must recognise the
importance of meeting these needs following a number of case reviews and recent
government initiatives.</p>

<p>Some of the reasons for improved multi-agency working between civilian and military
services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>awareness of domestic abuse within armed forces families is improving as a result of the Ministry of Defence’s commitment to support the cross-government Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) agenda. This has included the development of Joint Service Publication (JSP) 913, Tri-Service Policy on Domestic Abuse and
Sexual Violence (this policy is currently under review). Within this policy it clearly states that domestic abuse within the armed forces will not be tolerated, alongside a commitment to increase awareness of this issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are an increasing number of armed forces families living in their own homes, rather than in service family accommodation. There are also an increased number of reservists. These two factors make it more likely that civilian-based services will be considered and accessed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>domestic Violence Homicide Reviews are now compulsory which has led to an increased awareness of the need to share information and work together in order to protect victims. For more information go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-homicide-review-lessons-learned">Domestic Homicide Reviews Common themes identified as Lessons to be Learned.</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Building Relationships with the UK Armed Forces Community</h3>

<p>This Handbook provides a general overview of the British Armed Forces. The size and role
of military units, as well as the scope of the armed forces welfare support network will vary
nationally; it is suggested that civilian practitioners engage with local units in order to actively
build relationships with military welfare providers (see list below). The importance of
understanding local working practices whilst also building strong relationships between
agencies is well recognised. Civilian agencies and safeguarding meetings should ensure
that the armed forces welfare providers are included in order to ensure anyone affected by
domestic abuse is appropriately supported.</p>

<p>The following list suggests ways of building a strong working relationship with the local armed forces community:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit your local armed forces welfare providers and understand their role. In particular, make contact with your local single-Service specialist welfare provider who has a more specialised role within the military welfare system (see paragraph 3.2).</li>
  <li>understand the wider military support network</li>
  <li>meet with the local chain of command (chain of command is broadly defined by rank, and is the structure through which authority and direction flows). The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/en/articles/art20130702112133708" rel="external">Armed Forces rank structure is explained by the BBC</a>
</li>
  <li>there will be commanders who are responsible for the local infrastructure and support services within a military base. Within that base there will also be Commanding Officers who have responsibility for the units and the people within them</li>
  <li>review local military websites</li>
  <li>actively work to establish a multi-agency support network for the armed forces community comprising both military and civilian support services</li>
  <li>include the military community in local domestic abuse forums and groups. Also possibly consider establishing a local military domestic abuse group in order to help local agencies work together and share key information. An action plan for establishing a military group is included in Appendix 1</li>
  <li>in some areas it may be possible to secure an initial invitation to a military based welfare meeting. It may also be possible to link into local armed forces Covenant initiatives or meetings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone working with civilian support services recognises the importance of understanding local working practices whilst also building strong relationships with other agencies; this requirement is no different when interfacing with the armed forces community.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background Information: The armed forces</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>The British Armed Forces</h3>

<p>The British Armed Forces consist of the Royal Navy, Army and the Royal Air Force. More information on each of these military services can be found at the links detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" rel="external">Royal Navy</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/" rel="external">British Army</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/" rel="external">Royal Air Force</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although there are similarities between the three Services, there are also differences in
terms of service. For example, the length of time UK Armed Forces families may be stationed in
one area, whether families are more likely to be living in <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> and the way in which welfare
support is provided. It must also be understood that within each of the Services there are
further differences depending on factors such as unit size and role. It is helpful for civilian
practitioners to have an understanding of the specifics relevant to the armed forces branch
within their local area (see para 3.1 and 3.2).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Benefits of Interfacing with the UK Armed Forces</h3>

<p>Civilian practitioners who establish a mutually supportive working relationship with military
units in their area ensure families will be able to benefit from both civilian and armed forces
welfare provision; this will help all services meet the specific needs of the individual. It is
essential to understand who the local armed forces welfare providers are, as well as the
wider armed forces support network so that safeguarding options can be considered and
put in place. It is also important to understand the local chain of command and their
potential role in supporting families.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Risk Factors for Domestic Abuse</h3>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest that domestic abuse is any more prevalent within the UK Armed
Forces, however the following points could place additional pressure on families:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research has indicated that people between the ages of 20 and 40 are at highest risk of experiencing domestic abuse – this age range is strongly represented in the armed forces</li>
  <li>regular assignments and geographic separation can isolate victims by cutting them off from their family and support systems</li>
  <li>regular assignments can make it difficult for a spouse to maintain a career, resulting in them being more economically dependent on the serving partner</li>
  <li>regular deployments and reunions create unique stresses on armed forces families.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Institutional Challenges</h3>

<p>People affected by domestic abuse, including victims, perpetrators and children within the
household, will often try to hide the abuse they are experiencing. For those from the Armed
Forces community there will be additional concerns and barriers to be overcome in order to
help them access support and report the abuse.</p>

<p>Some common concerns that have been highlighted through research include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fear of career consequence, either for them if they are serving, or their serving partner</li>
  <li>the potential impact on housing, economic security and pensions</li>
  <li>a perceived stigma attached to male victims.</li>
</ul>

<p>A strong relationship between civilian support services and armed forces welfare providers will help victims seek the support they need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Tri-Service Policy</h3>

<p>Domestic abuse is not tolerated within the armed forces. The main policy document for the
armed forces is Joint Service Publication (JSP) 913, Tri-Service Policy on Domestic Abuse
and Sexual Violence (this policy is currently under review). JSP 913 details the
responsibilities of the chain of command and the procedures for military welfare provision.
Each of the three Services has additional policies that are Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air
Force specific. The key policy documents for the Army are: Army General Administrative
Instruction (AGAI) 81 and Army Briefing Note (ABN) 103/14. The key policy documents for
the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> are: Air Publication (AP) 3392 Volume 2 Leaflet 2414 (Domestic Abuse Practice
Policy); AP 1722 Part 3 Leaflet 3528 (<abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Police Procedures for Domestic Abuse, Sexual
Violence and Child Protection; <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Internal Briefing Note (IBN) 49/14 (Dealing with
Domestic Abuse in the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>).</p>

<p>A number of additional tri-service policies that may be relevant to cases of domestic abuse are outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSP 770 – Tri-Service Operational and Non-Operational Welfare Policy. This policy also refers to domestic abuse</li>
  <li>JSP 763 – <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> Bullying and Harassment Complaints Procedure. This policy gives direction on the “separation of parties” which could be used in cases of domestic abuse between serving personnel; particularly those living in Single Living Accommodation</li>
  <li>2014DIN01-209 – Guidance to Commanding Officers and Victims when dealing with
Allegations of Serious Criminal Offences including Sexual Offences. Within this DIN
the Commanding Officer has the option of managing working patterns, moving the
victim or offender and offering a career change or compassionate discharge where
appropriate and/or required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Welfare Support within the UK Armed Forces Community</h2>

<p>All military units have an established welfare support structure to call upon. It is important to
understand that different organisations work to different confidentiality codes; civilian
practitioners must understand these specifics when interfacing with armed forces welfare
providers. The UK Armed Forces community can access an extensive support network which is
outlined below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Unit Based Welfare Support</h3>

<p>Local support is carried out by The Royal Naval Divisional System in the Naval Service, by
Unit Welfare Officers in the Army and by <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Personnel Staffs in the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>. These services
are part of the Chain of Command and work to the <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> code of confidentiality. Although
these organisations are Service-specific, when serving in joint units, serving personnel and
their families can access whichever welfare organisation is best suited to meet their needs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Service Specialist Welfare Organisations</h3>

<p>In addition to Unit based welfare support (known as first level), the armed forces also have
single-Service specialist welfare providers (sometimes referred to as second line) who deal
with the most complex cases and are independent of the chain of command. Staffs
providing welfare support at the Unit level are mandated to refer situations involving Child
Protection and domestic abuse to the Service specialist welfare providers, which are detailed
below:</p>

<h4>The Naval Service Family and People Support (NS FPS)</h4>

<p>The Naval Service Family and People Support (NS FPS) offer confidential advice
and welfare support for all Royal Naval and Royal Marine personnel and their
families. They work to a single point of contact which allows easy access to all
welfare services for families, service personnel and unit staff. More information on
the service provided by NS FPS can be found at on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/community-and-support/advice-and-support/local-support" rel="external">Royal Navy website</a>.</p>

<h4>Army Welfare Service (<abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>The Army Welfare Service (<abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr>) provides professional, confidential welfare support
to Army personnel and their families. <abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr> works in support of the Chain of
Command but remains independent from it. <abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr> is currently in transition and is
moving towards a single point of access via an <abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr> Intake and Assessment team.
This team will be fully operational by December 2015. In the interim, <abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr> can be
contacted on 01252 787586. More information on <abbr title="Army Welfare Service">AWS</abbr> can be found at the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.army.mod.uk/people/support-well/the-army-welfare-service-aws/" rel="external">British
Army website</a>.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> – <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> Support</h4>

<p>In addition to the wider support available through <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> (Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen
Families Association), the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> has commissioned a UK based confidential personal
support and social work service. Support is controlled on a regional basis, with all
large and medium sized stations having <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> fieldworkers. The personal support
and social work service can be accessed by all <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> personnel, including Reserves,
and their families. More information on this support service, as well as regional
contact details, can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ssafa.org.uk/get-help/raf-personal-support-and-social-work-service" rel="external"><abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Forcesline</h3>

<p>Forcesline is a free, confidential telephone helpline and e-mail service run by <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr>.
Experienced staff provide a supportive listening and signposting service for current and
former members of the armed forces and their families. More information can be found at
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ssafa.org.uk/get-help/forcesline" rel="external"><abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> website, Forces Line</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Chaplaincy Support</h3>

<p>Chaplains work within each of the Armed Services and are located with units throughout the
world. Chaplaincy support, which is confidential and outside of the Chain of Command, is
available to all service personnel and their families. Chaplains provide spiritual leadership,
moral guidance, and pastoral support, regardless of religion or belief; the Padre is around to
talk to and help everyone. Chaplaincy support can be accessed locally, with further details
available through the HIVE Information Centres (see sub-section below).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Families Federation</h3>

<p>Each of the three Services has a Families Federation that is there to represent the needs of
the service family; they are independent organisations that will offer confidential advice,
signposting as well as a voice on any relevant issue. They can be contacted either by
telephone or e-mail, with key information outlined on their websites which are detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nff.org.uk/" rel="external">Navy Families Federation</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.aff.org.uk/" rel="external">Army Families Federation</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.raf-ff.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Families Federation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>HIVE Information Centres</h3>

<p>The HIVE is an information network available to all members of the Service community.
HIVE Information Centres provide up-to-date, relevant information and can be contacted in

<span class="number">3.8 </span>Charity Support</h3>

<p>There are many charities that support the armed forces community. Links to two of the main organisations are detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ssafa.org.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/" rel="external">Royal British Legion (RBL)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Royal British Legion (RBL) provides lifelong support for members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, Reservists, veterans and their families all year round. It is a national organisation that works in
local communities across the UK, delivering information, advice and support. The
Legion’s support does not automatically end should you divorce or separate from
your spouse or partner. Please follow this link to find out more on eligibility British
Legion website or speak directly with Legion staff. Find out more by visiting the
Legion online advice centre www.britishlegion.org.uk, or by calling 0808 802 8080
(8am to 8 pm, 7 days a week) or popping into one of the Legion information centres
across the country. The phone line is free from UK landlines and main mobile
networks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>Support for Reservists and Veterans</h3>

<p>Reservists can access the welfare services that directly support serving personnel (see para
3.2) when their welfare concern has developed in the run up to, during or after reserve
service, or if the welfare concern is as a result of undertaking such service. Additional
information and support services available to veterans and their families, beyond standard
civilian support services, are outlined at Chapter 5: Resources and Contact Information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Tools and Supporting Information for Civilian Support Services</h2>

<p>The following information provides civilian support services with the additional information and the understanding required to fully support a victim of domestic abuse from the UK Armed Forces community.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Useful Questions to Help Assess an Individual’s Specific Safety Planning Needs</h3>

<p>The following questions will help formulate an individual safety plan and should be used in addition to generic safety planning considerations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the victim is serving what is their rank? If the perpetrator is serving what is their rank? Do they live in service family accommodation? How long have they been in the armed forces?</li>
  <li>are there any upcoming deployments or returns from deployments? Is the victim concerned about the deployment or will this provide them with an opportunity to put plans in place if they wish to leave the relationship?</li>
  <li>is the serving individual due to be assigned to another base (in the UK or abroad)? If so, does this present a problem in terms of ongoing support? It is important to ensure that agencies in the area the family may move to are aware of their domestic abuse background.</li>
  <li>what does the victim want (if anything) in terms of military response?</li>
  <li>has the victim reported the abuse to anyone within the armed forces? What exactly did he/she report? To whom? What happened?</li>
  <li>does the victim wish to remain in the relationship or separate from their partner? If they wish to separate, additional factors such as accommodation, movement (either nationally or internationally) and transition into a civilian community may need to be managed. There may also be financial complications if the victim is financially
dependent on the perpetrator. Non-British spouses of armed forces personnel may be dependent on their partner for their immigration status, which in turn can impact on their right to reside, work or claim recourse to public funds in the UK</li>
  <li>does the victim consent to the sharing of information with armed forces welfare providers or the chain of command in order to help keep them safe? If so, which services are they happy for this information to be shared with and are there any limitations? Are there safeguarding concerns which necessitate the sharing of information without consent (including referral to the Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference and/or to Children’s/Adult’s Services)?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of options which are available to the chain of command and should be
considered alongside civilian safeguarding options to help enhance and complement safety
planning e.g. generate breathing space by moving a serving perpetrator into Single Living
Accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>) or possibly sending then away on a course.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Deciding how to Proceed Following a Disclosure of Domestic Abuse</h3>

<p>As in all cases, the over-riding concern should be to ensure the immediate safety of the
victim and any children. All practitioners, both civilian and military, will be expected to refer
to their own agency protocols for domestic abuse. Consideration should also be given to
emergency housing needs and the involvement of the Home Office Police Safeguarding
Team and Children’s/Adult’s Services. The Working Together 2013 document highlights that
where Child Protection concerns exist the single-Service welfare providers should be
engaged with and also invited to attend Child Protection conferences. Additionally, JSP 913
states that domestic abuse incidents where a child is or would normally be present, or where
the woman is pregnant, must be reported immediately to the Local Authority Children’s
Social Care Services and to the appropriate single-Service specialist welfare provider. The
single-Service specialist welfare providers are key agencies for civilian staff to engage with
to ensure that the military and civilian provision is provided to those in need in an appropriate
and timely fashion.</p>

<p>Some of the major concerns likely to be voiced by victims are detailed below. When considering these concerns it is important to keep the following points in mind:</p>

<p>Determining whether a victim’s fears are real or perceived will depend on a wide range of factors including; severity of abuse/violence, relationship with armed forces welfare personnel, rank and performance of serving individual (whether victim or perpetrator).</p>

<p>There are safety benefits as well as risks to reporting. The victim should be made aware of both in order to make an informed decision. The victim should also be made aware of the benefits of sharing information.</p>

<p>A good working relationship with those within the armed forces welfare support system will generate answers to a hypothetical situation; thereby informing the victim of how certain situations could play out.</p>

<h4>Victims’ Concerns – Increased violence/retaliation by the perpetrator</h4>

<p>All victims face increased risks when they take action to change their relationship with an
abusive partner and end the violence and controlling behaviour they have been
experiencing. These risks may be amplified in the military context because of the close link
between professional and personal lives for serving personnel.</p>

<p>Additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assess risk level by using an approved risk assessment tool and explore any issues that may be military specific</li>
  <li>consider the need to refer cases for a multi-agency response (MARAC)</li>
  <li>talk about safety planning options that include both military options and civilian legal remedies</li>
  <li>understand and explain accommodation options.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Victims’ Concerns – A serving perpetrator will face career consequences or discharge</h4>

<p>This is often the primary concern which stops victims from seeking help and reporting cases
of domestic abuse; this is more a perception than actual reality. Although it is very rare for a
serving perpetrator to be discharged due to domestic abuse, the armed forces do not
condone domestic abuse in any circumstance.</p>

<p>Additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explore the sources of the victim’s fears about their partner’s career. Perpetrators will often maximise this fear to threaten the victim and secure their silence</li>
  <li>make sure you have some understanding of the disciplinary and administrative action that may be taken against a perpetrator; your local unit or military welfare provider will be able to advise you. Also understand how any measures are recorded</li>
  <li>are there any career implications</li>
  <li>when a couple separate the armed forces welfare services will be able to help families as they transition out of the armed forces community.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Victims’ Concerns – I will have to leave my house</h4>

<p>Every effort is made by the Services to assist estranged families by providing sufficient time
to reconcile. In consultation with the serving spouse, the Chain of Command and the inservice housing provider, there is the ability utilise a 93 days window prior to changing marital status, during which the serving spouse can occupy Single Living Accommodation (<abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr>) at no charge (less food). In the event that the couple decide not to reconcile and they formally separate, the serving spouse is required to change their marital status on JPA and
must also notify the housing provider of the change in their marital circumstances.</p>

<p>The estranged family is then entitled to continued occupancy of the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> for a further 93 days, and the housing provider issues a formal Notice to Vacate (<abbr title="Notice to vacate">NTV</abbr>) the property to coincide with this timeframe. Following this 93 days there is no continued entitlement to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> and the estranged family is expected to move out of the property, however, individual family circumstances such as medical treatment or children’s education will be taken into
consideration in what is known as a Proportionality Exercise and the housing provider may
agree to a different period in which the family is required to move out. It should be noted that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the serving spouse remains responsible for the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> charges during both the reconciliation and <abbr title="Notice to vacate">NTV</abbr> periods. Payment of utilities would be down to agreement between the estranged couple</li>
  <li>following the 93 day <abbr title="Notice to vacate">NTV</abbr> period the estranged spouse will become responsible for all costs in connection with the <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (unless the serving spouse volunteers to pay).The charges applied are no longer at entitled rates and are calculated by the Type of property occupied (number of bedrooms) X a ‘daily rate’. The serving spouse will then incur full <abbr title="Single Living Accommodation">SLA</abbr> charges</li>
  <li>the serving spouse is not allowed to reoccupy <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr> (without the Commanding Officer’s permission) unless and until he/she resumes cohabitation with the spouse on a permanent domestic basis and any decree of divorce has been rescinded, or until they remarry, or until he/she has the recognised parental responsibility of any
children of the family to satisfy entitlement to <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>. The estranged spouse is able to move private effects for the final move out of service provided accommodation in the UK into private accommodation at public expense, applied for by the service spouse. In cases where estrangement occurs overseas, the Commanding Officer should give the estranged spouse the opportunity to move back to the UK before the start of the 93 day
Notice to Vacate period. This move is publically funded and the estranged spouse can elect
to have the move made either to a surplus <abbr title="Service Family Accommodation">SFA</abbr>, the Services Cotswold Centre, <abbr title="Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen Families Association">SSAFA</abbr>
Stepping Stones homes or private accommodation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional information on these housing options is detailed below:</h4>

</ul>

<h4>Victims’ Concerns – The perpetrator will not be held accountable</h4>

<p>Commanding Officers have broad discretion in deciding what action, if any, will be taken
against a perpetrator, provided a criminal offence has not occurred. If they are made aware
they will also take into account the wider situation and wishes of the victim. It is possible that
although the victim has spoken to the perpetrators superior, they may not have spoken to
the Commanding Officer who is responsible for managing the situation, and will oversee
issues such as discipline, accommodation options and possible release for a local
perpetrator support programme. Victims should be encouraged to clearly identify specific
acts of violence or abuse rather than referring to the general situation so that an evidence
base can be established that will inform and influence how a Commanding Officer would
manage a situation of domestic abuse.</p>

<p>Additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who, if anyone, has the victim talked to about the issue? What was the response? Is the perpetrator a friend of the person they reported their concerns to?</li>
  <li>explore what the victim knows about the perpetrators overall level of support from their direct supervisor and/or commander</li>
  <li>try and establish if the victim has spoken to any senior personnel at the unit. It is important to approach the right person in the Chain of Command; action will be taken and the victim will not be ignored</li>
  <li>discuss hypothetical scenarios with military welfare providers who can provide valuable insight into the likely response from the military commander.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Victims’ Concerns – A serving victim will face career consequences</h4>

<p>Victims who are serving within the armed forces may have concerns regarding the impact
on their military career were they to seek help and support. Shame and fear of exposure is a
common barrier that stops victims of domestic abuse coming forward; this concern can be
even more significant for serving victims. Another concern to victims who serve within the
armed forces is the fear that everyone in their unit will know what is happening to them;
they are working in an environment where they are expected to be robust and not a ‘victim’.
Male victims who are serving in the armed forces are also often concerned if they have
children. They do not want to leave the abusive relationship because they are reluctant to
leave their children in the care of a perpetrator, and they may also worry that they would
struggle to get custody of their children due to the nature of their employment.</p>

<p>Additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explore the relationship between the victim and their Commanding Officer</li>
  <li>explore the circumstances of the perpetrator. Are they civilian or military? If they are also serving are they senior or junior to the victim?</li>
  <li>ensure the victim understands that the armed forces do not tolerate domestic abuse and they will be supportive of the victim.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional Options and Tools</h4>

<p>The tools and options available to the civilian support services can always be applied to a
domestic abuse situation within the UK Armed Forces community. Safety planning has already
been covered at section 4.2.</p>

<p>A number of other options are detailed below:</p>

<h4>Legal Remedies through Home Office Police Force</h4>

<p><strong>Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme / Clare’s Law</strong></p>

<p>The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, also known as Clare’s Law gives the public a formal way of
requesting information about a partners past. Anyone with a specific concern can
request information, including potential victims as well as a friend, relative, loved-one,
carer or neighbour. If a person has a history of violence the Home Office Police can
disclose information in order to protect people at risk of harm.</p>

<p><strong>Domestic Violence Protection Notices and Orders</strong></p>

<p>The police can apply for Domestic Violence Protection Notices and Orders to prevent further violence
between partners. They can be used in the aftermath of certain domestic violence
incidents, and can prevent someone contacting their partner for 48 hours. The police
can then apply for an order from a Magistrates court which can extend the same
protection for between 14 and 28 days. They are used to create breathing space for
victims, and when it is thought appropriate can be applied without the victim’s
consent.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Legal Advice and Information</h2>

<p>Local solicitors can provide legal advice to address immediate and long term needs for example nonmolestation orders, occupation orders, issues around child contact. In some cases Legal Aid may be available; eligibility can be confirmed by a legal aid family solicitor or through the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://civil-eligibility-calculator.justice.gov.uk/" rel="external">Civil Legal Aid calculator</a>. Some solicitors are able to provide a free initial assessment or fixed fee options. To find a local solicitor visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://find-legal-advice.justice.gov.uk/" rel="external">Find legal Advice website</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/" rel="external">Law Society website</a>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ncdv.org.uk/" rel="external">National Centre for Domestic Violence (NCDV)</a> is able to assist in obtaining emergency injunctions where there has been a recent physical assault or threat. 
Their support is short term and more specific; for additional information visit their website.
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> can provide advice on legal options as well as benefit entitlement. It is possible to arrange an appointment with an advisor through <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="external">their website</a>, which also details factsheets and contact details; see  <a class="govuk-link" href="http://rightsofwomen.org.uk/" rel="external">Rights of Women</a> works to achieve justice and equality by informing, educating and empowering women on their legal rights.</p>

<h4>Divorce and Child Residency Arrangements</h4>

<p>Information regarding the care of children when a couple divorce or separate can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/overview.">Looking after Children guidance on gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Community Based Perpetrator Support</h4>

<p>Perpetrators who are worried about their behaviour can voluntarily access civilian-based
support, for example, telephone help lines or community-based perpetrator support programmes.
Arrangements to attend the longer term programmes may require Chain of Command
support if there may be an impact on military commitments. Although the armed forces are
broadly supportive of these programmes, they may not actively refer.</p>

<h4>Relocation and Transitional Support</h4>

<p>When a couple separate and their marital status is changed they will both still be entitled to
support from military welfare providers, and where necessary they will be actively supported
as they transition out of the military community. It should be recognised that entitlements to 
a number of allowances and benefits will change, and will be driven by who has primary care
for any children in the family. AGAI 83 outlines Army policy that details the support available
to a family as it transitions out of the armed forces community; this includes the coordination of links between military welfare providers and the aftercare community. Similar policy for the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> can be found in AP 3392 Volume 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Special Circumstances</h3>

<h4>Immigration Issues</h4>

<p>Non-British spouses of armed forces personnel may be dependent on their partner for their
immigration status. In abusive relationships this reliance can be used as a threat to silence
the victim. In cases of domestic abuse where either one or both partners are Non-British
nationals their immigration status can impact on their right to reside, work or claim recourse
to public funds in the UK; this is a very complicated issue. When a victim of domestic abuse
is not a British citizen or European Economic Area (EEA) national it is important to seek
qualified immigration advice as soon as possible after a relationship has broken down rather
than wait until their current visa has expired. When the perpetrator is residing in the UK on a
dependant’s visa, a breakdown in the relationship may mean their visa is no longer valid and
they will have to return to their country of origin.</p>

<p>Domestic abuse victims (and their children) who are subject to UK immigration controls, may
be eligible for settlement or Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) if they have experienced
domestic abuse as the partner of a British citizen, a person settled in the UK, or a Foreign or
Commonwealth member of the armed forces who has served for at least 4 years. The
Domestic Violence Concession allows domestic abuse victims to apply for settlement (ILR)
in their own right, enabling access to UK state support. Spouses or partners of service
personnel who are not British citizens or have not settled in the UK and who have not yet
served for four years are not eligible for leave to remain under the domestic violence
provisions. They would need to take Office of the Immigration Service Commissioner
(OISC) accredited advice on whether they were eligible to remain for other reasons.
Any victim of domestic abuse who intends to apply for ILR should seek qualified immigration
advice before submitting an application. Please see guidance to help you find a local
registered immigration advisor which includes links to The Office of the Immigration Service
Commissioner (OISC) who have a register of regulated immigration advisers, including those
who do not charge clients for advice or services; please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://home.oisc.gov.uk/register_of_regulated_immigration_advisers/register.aspx" rel="external">visit the register</a> for further details.
More information on this process, including the eligibility of children, can be found on the
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settle-in-the-uk/y/you-re-the-family-member-of-a-british-citizen/no/on-a-work-visa/tier-5">Find out if you can apply to settle in the UK guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Victims Stationed Overseas</h4>

<p>Domestic abuse victims may become more vulnerable if the family moves overseas.
Isolation can become an issue and there are likely to be fewer support services available.
The family may live either on or off a military base and the victim may not always be
protected by the laws of the host country; specific advice should be sought from local military
welfare providers regarding this issue. Families with a history of domestic abuse are less
likely to be posted overseas due to increased vulnerability and a reduced access to support
services.</p>

<p>Additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if a victim may be posted overseas discuss the options for remaining in the UK</li>
  <li>if the victim is going to be posted overseas investigate the availability of civilian support services and shelter options</li>
  <li>understand and explain the options for an early posting back to the UK if this becomes necessary.</li>
  <li>if the victim is non-British and assigned overseas they will need to maintain a valid entry visa for access into the UK if required at short notice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.13 </span>Summary</h3>

<p>Practitioners working in support services or local communities recognise the need to understand the working practices of other agencies as well as the importance of building strong and enduring relationships with other support providers and community groups. It is hoped that this Handbook helps civilian practitioners support victims, perpetrators and families from the armed forces community who are affected by domestic abuse. This could be for a specific case, or for ongoing commitments within an area where the armed forces are strongly represented. The UK Armed Forces community is a reflection of wider society, and it is important to ensure that although the dynamics they manage may be quite unique, the support they receive is as effective as their civilian counterparts.</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to ensure the information contained in this Handbook is accurate and current at the time of publication.</p>
