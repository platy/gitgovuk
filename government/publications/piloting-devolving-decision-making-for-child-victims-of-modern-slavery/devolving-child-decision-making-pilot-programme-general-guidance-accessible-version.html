<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) is the UK’s framework for identifying victims of modern slavery and human trafficking <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. The Single Competent Authority (SCA) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and the Immigration Enforcement Competent Authority in the Home Office are the Competent Authorities, and consider cases of potential victims referred to the NRM by First Responder Organisations. These Competent Authorities operate a two-stage decision-making process to determine whether an individual is a victim of modern slavery. The relevant Competent Authority will make a Reasonable Grounds decision to determine whether it ‘suspects but cannot prove’ that an individual is a potential victim of modern slavery. This decision should be made within 5 working days of referral, where possible. The relevant Competent Authority will go on to make a Conclusive Grounds decision no sooner than 45 calendar days after the reasonable grounds decision, to determine whether ‘on the balance of probabilities’ there are sufficient grounds to decide that the individual is a victim of modern slavery.</p>

<p>In 2020, 10,613 potential victims of modern slavery were referred to the NRM, a similar number to 2019 and a 52% increase from 2018. In 2020, 4,946 of these referrals (47%) were for individuals who claimed they were exploited as minors. The profile of child victims is changing, with UK national children being the fastest growing group in the NRM in England and Wales, in part driven by county lines activity.</p>

<p>Support for child victims of modern slavery and trafficking, except for the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian service <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and Scottish Guardianship Service <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, is provided by local authorities and partner agencies under existing statutory obligations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> and is provided regardless of their nationality or immigration status.</p>

<p>In England and Wales local safeguarding partners – local authorities, police and clinical commissioning groups – have a duty to work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children including child victims of modern slavery. In Scotland, local authorities have a duty to work together with multi-agency partners – police and health professionals – to support and care for child victims of human trafficking and exploitation through child protection processes <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> and the Getting It Right for Every Child <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> approach to improving outcomes for children and young people.</p>

<p>Given local safeguarding partners are the primary support providers to children, we are seeking to understand through this Pilot Programme the benefits of a local, multi-agency approach to identification of child victims of modern slavery, referred to herein as the ‘Pilot Programme’.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Pilot Programme</h2>

<p>The Pilot Programme forms part of a wider Transformation Programme of activity to identify sustainable longer-term options for the NRM. The purpose of the Pilot Programme is to test whether determining if a child is a victim of modern slavery within existing safeguarding structures is a more appropriate model for making modern slavery decisions for children. This approach will enable decisions about whether a child is a victim of modern slavery to be made by those involved in their care and ensure the decisions made are closely aligned with the provision of local, needs-based support and any law enforcement response.</p>

<h2>Scope of the Pilot Programme</h2>

<p>Pilot areas have been identified via a competitive process, which was open to all local authorities in the United Kingdom which are responsible for children’s social care. The competition was designed to ensure that a diverse range of areas across the UK were selected to be part of the Pilot Programme, allowing us to test the model in different settings. This includes Scotland which operates with devolved legislation and statutory duties regarding child welfare, protection and human trafficking, as well as having a different criminal justice system in relation to the prosecution of human trafficking. Applications were welcomed from either individual local authorities or local authorities acting together as a consortium.</p>

<p>The following ten sites have been selected to take part in the pilot through fair and open competition:</p>

<p>The Pilot Programme will be open to all children in the pilot areas who are more than 100 days away from their 18th birthday where the safeguarding responsibility falls to one of the local authorities listed above. Children who are within 100 days of their 18th birthday will continue to have decisions made by the SCA. This 100-day period is to ensure decisions are complete before a child’s 18th birthday. Other than in exceptional cases, decisions should be complete within 90 days. There is flexibility for pilot areas to inform the SCA if a decision is going to take more than 90 days due to evidence not being available.</p>

<p>Individual start dates will be agreed with pilot sites based on their readiness for go-live. All sites are expected to be taking decisions by the end of June 2021 at the latest. The Pilot Programme will operate for 12 months.</p>

<h2>Requirements and decision-making</h2>

<p>We are keen to provide as much flexibility as possible in how the pilots operate. However, there are some elements that will be common to decision-making across all pilot sites to ensure consistency and alignment with published guidance. Decision-making will follow the same process and will be made in accordance with the same definitions and thresholds as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Modern slavery: statutory guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and non-statutory guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland Chapter 7 and Annex E</a>. The detail of how this will operate is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/piloting-devolving-decision-making-for-child-victims-of-modern-slavery">Devolving Child Decision-Making Pilot Programme: Decision-Making Guidance for Pilot Sites</a>. The key elements of the pilot programme are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In all cases children will continue to receive appropriate safeguarding and support in line with current statutory requirements irrespective of the stage they are at in the decision-making process <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>Both the Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions will be taken through a multi-agency structure at one or more meetings, with representation from the three safeguarding partners – the local authority, health and police – as a minimum. The chair of the multi-agency structure should not be the lead social worker involved in a child’s case to ensure the social worker is able to represent the child’s view and avoid any conflict of interest.</li>
  <li>Where the Pilot Programme is in an area where the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian (ICTG) service, the Scottish Guardianship Service or equivalent statutory provision is rolled out, the views of the ICTG or Scottish Guardian should be sought before taking a Conclusive Grounds decision and they should be invited to share information and attend any relevant meetings. As they are independent, the ICTG and the Scottish Guardian must not participate in the decision-making <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>A Reasonable Grounds decision should be made no later than 45 days from the date the pilot site receives the referral. A positive Conclusive Grounds decision can also be made at the same meeting if there is sufficient evidence to do so.</li>
  <li>If a pilot site deems the evidence gathered for the first multi-agency meeting is insufficient for a positive decision to be taken at the same meeting, then a second meeting to make the Conclusive Grounds decision should take place no later than 45 days after the first meeting (90 days in total).</li>
  <li>A negative Conclusive Grounds decision should not be made at an initial meeting if a positive Reasonable Grounds has been reached. Instead, a second meeting to make the Conclusive Grounds decision should be scheduled to allow for further evidence to come to light or be collected.</li>
  <li>Where the multi-agency structure has considered the evidence to make a Conclusive Grounds decision and assesses that there is insufficient evidence to make a positive decision, they must notify the Home Office of that assessment and provide a date for a follow-up meeting no later than 45 days after that initial meeting.</li>
  <li>Children in the Pilot Programme will continue to receive a Recovery Period of a minimum of 45 calendar days in England and Wales, as set out in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory Guidance for England and Wales and Non-Statutory Guidance in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and of 45 calendar days in Northern Ireland and 90 calendar days in Scotland, as set out in the respective legislation. This is irrespective of when the Conclusive Grounds decisions are made by the Local Authority Pilot Sites. After a positive Reasonable Grounds decision, but there will be no minimum period of time a Local Authority is required to wait before making a positive Conclusive Grounds decision where they feel they have sufficient information to make a contemporaneous positive decision. Where a Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decision cannot be made in the same meeting, the Pilot Site will aim to make a Conclusive Grounds decision no later than 45 days after a positive Reasonable Grounds decision is made.</li>
  <li>The pilot sites must keep the SCA informed of outcomes of a Reasonable Grounds and/or a Conclusive Grounds decision, and will collate the relevant information required by the SCA to:
    <ul>
      <li>update relevant Home Office databases;</li>
      <li>issue decision letters; and</li>
      <li>publish the quarterly government statistics in relation to child victims of modern slavery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All data shared between the Home Office and pilot sites will be via the Home Office secure data transfer portal, MOVEit <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Support and quality assurance</h2>

<p>The Home Office will offer a package of support to the pilot sites throughout the Pilot Programme which will include funding, training and technical expertise. The programme will be subject to a rigorous evaluation which is being overseen by an independently chaired evaluation panel.</p>

<p>One of the ways the Home Office will ensure the standard and consistency of decisions are upheld is through robust training. It is important that the location of the child has no bearing on the quality of the decision they receive, and therefore individuals who participate in the decision-making will be required to undertake the appropriate training.</p>

<p>The Home Office will quality assure some of the decisions made by pilot sites. The approach taken will be flexible and dependant on performance. As part of quality assurance, the Home Office may require the pilot site to review a decision and/or gather further information to enable a decision to be reviewed. Where this happens, the Home Office will provide an explanation of the reason the decision has not passed quality assurance and the pilot site will have 10 working days to respond to the Home Office and set out how it will review and revise the decision.<br>
All negative Conclusive Grounds decisions will continue to be reviewed by Multi-Agency Assurance Panels.</p>
