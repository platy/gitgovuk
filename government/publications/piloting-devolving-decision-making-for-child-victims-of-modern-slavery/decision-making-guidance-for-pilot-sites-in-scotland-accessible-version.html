<h2>Assessing reliability, credibility and other evidence during the decision-making process</h2>

<p>1.6 	Pilot Sites need to assess whether a potential victim’s account of human trafficking and exploitation is credible when making a Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.7	Good practice in working with victims who have experienced trauma should be observed. See the Interagency Guidance Child Trafficking and Exploitation 2019 for more information on trauma informed practice. The need to take into account the impact trauma is likely to have on the individual’s ability to recall events does not remove the need to assess all information critically and objectively when considering the credibility of a case.</p>

<h2>Assessing credibility</h2>

<p>1.8	Pilot Sites are entitled to consider credibility as part of their decision-making process at both the Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds stages. When Pilot Sites are assessing the credibility of an account, they must consider both the external and internal credibility of the material facts.</p>

<p>1.9	If they fit the definition of human trafficking or slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labour, there is reliable supporting evidence and the account is credible to the required standard of proof, the Pilot Site should recognise the person as being a victim of trafficking.</p>

<h2>Mitigating circumstances</h2>

<p>1.10	It is important for the Pilot Site to assess all information critically and objectively when the Pilot Site considers the credibility of a case, but it is also vital for decision makers to have an understanding of the mitigating reasons why a potential victim of trafficking is incoherent, inconsistent or delays giving details of material facts.</p>

<p>1.11	Throughout this process it is important to remember that victims of trafficking have been through trauma, and that this may impact on the information they provide. Due to trauma there may be valid reasons why a potential victim’s account is inconsistent or lacks sufficient detail. The Pilot Site should have account of any relevant factors set out in the Glasgow Child Trafficking and Exploitation guidance section which outlines some of the challenge’s victims may face in providing a clear and consistent account of their experiences. The Pilot Site should take these reasons into account when considering the credibility of a claim.</p>

<p>1.12	The Pilot Site must keep in mind the child’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added vulnerability</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>possible grooming by the traffickers and exploiters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materiality</h2>

<p>1.13	In assessing credibility, the Pilot Site should assess the material facts of past and present events (material facts being those which are serious and significant in nature) which may indicate that a person is a victim of trafficking. It is generally unnecessary, and sometimes counter productive, to focus on minor or peripheral facts that are not material to the claim.</p>

<p>1.13	The Pilot Site should assess the material facts based on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are they coherent and consistent with any past written or verbal statements?</li>
  <li>how well does the evidence submitted fit together and does it contradict itself?</li>
  <li>are they consistent with claims made by witnesses and with any documentary evidence submitted in support of the claim or gathered during the course of your investigations/ assessment?</li>
</ul>

<p>1.15	Where there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the child is a victim of trafficking (for example where the case is lacking key details, such as who exploited them or where the exploitation took place) staff at the Pilot Site are entitled to question whether the Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is met. However, if the Reasonable Grounds threshold is met Pilot Sites must also consider whether they are able to make a positive Conclusive Grounds decision on the evidence they have available, or if they need more information before making a Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<h2>Level of detail</h2>

<p>1.16	The level of detail with which a potential victim presents their claim is a factor when the Pilot Site assesses credibility. It is reasonable to assume that a victim giving an account of their human trafficking and exploitation experience will be more expressive and more likely to include sensory details (for example what they saw, heard, felt or thought about an event) than someone who has not had this experience. However, some traumatised individuals can struggle to verbally express distressing experiences, may appear numb or disconnected from their words or display other trauma-related responses.</p>

<p>1.17	Where there is insufficient evidence to support that the individual is a victim of trafficking the Pilot Site is entitled to question whether the Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is met.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>1.18 	It is also reasonable to assume that a potential victim who has experienced an event will be able to recount the central elements in a broadly consistent manner. A potential victim’s inability to remain consistent throughout their written and oral accounts of past and current events may lead the Pilot Site to question their account. However, before the Pilot Site comes to a negative conclusion, they should consider whether they are able to access further information which could clarify inconsistencies in the claim including whether the First Responder should be provided with the opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>1.19	Due to the trauma of human trafficking and exploitation there may be valid reasons why a potential victim’s account is inconsistent or lacks sufficient detail. The Pilot Site should take account of any evidence of mitigating circumstances that could explain the inconsistency.</p>

<h2>Considering gender and culture</h2>

<p>1.20	Pilot Sites should know how to consider gender and cultural issues in considering credibility.</p>

<p>1.21	It is important to understand that distress presents differently in different cultures and that cultural understanding of many situations is variable.</p>

<p>1.22	When making Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions the Pilot Site must take into account the individual position and personal circumstances of the person and consider cultural or gender issues.</p>

<p>1.23	Individuals from the same country of origin may have different experiences due to their cultural, ethnic, gender and sexual identity. For example, women may be unable to disclose relevant details due to cultural and social norms.</p>

<h2>Assessment of trafficking and exploitation</h2>

<p>1.24	In identifying human trafficking and exploitation, a multi-agency assessment will be undertaken by the Pilot Site at the Reasonable and Conclusive Grounds stages, having regard to all information in line with the procedures and guidance set out above. This will include information presented by a child or young person. Any engagement with a child or young person will be undertaken using a trauma informed approach and any assessment will have regard to the impact of trauma as set out in Section 4 of the 2019 inter agency guidance (trauma informed support and intervention).</p>

<p>1.25	The Pilot Site will follow the GIRFEC principles. GIRFEC is Scotland’s national framework that supports the wellbeing and safety of children through a holistic assessment of the child’s needs.</p>

<h2>Relevance of potential prosecution of perpetrators</h2>

<p>1.26	The Pilot Site needs to have an awareness of how prosecution of perpetrators could impact on a victim of trafficking’s Reasonable and Conclusive Grounds decisions.</p>

<p>1.27	When the Pilot Site is deciding whether there are Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds that a person is a victim of trafficking, their decision may be influenced by whether the alleged exploiter is being prosecuted. The Pilot Site decision is not dependent on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>here being a criminal investigation</li>
  <li>whether the child or young person cooperates with a criminal investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>1.28	The victim identification process is independent of any criminal proceedings against those responsible for the human trafficking and exploitation. The criminal standard of proof that “beyond reasonable doubt” is higher than that of the Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds test.</p>

<p>1.29	The Pilot Site must be aware that any information recorded as part of a Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds decision could be disclosed during a prosecution or a Subject Access Request.</p>

<h2>Views of professionals during pilot decision making</h2>

<p>1.30	Police, Social Work and Health are the primary decision makers in both Reasonable and Conclusive Grounds decisions.</p>

<p>1.31	A Reasonable Grounds decision may be taken at the Initial Referral Discussion (IRD).  Where the Reasonable Grounds decision is positive, but the Pilot Site does not believe it can take a positive Conclusive Grounds decision at the same time, for example, due to insufficient evidence, the Pilot Site will schedule a second meeting (Young Person’s Support and Protection Case Conference) to take the Conclusive Grounds decision within 45 calendar days of the initial meeting.</p>

<p>1.32	If a second meeting is required, Pilot Site decision makers should consider what evidence will be necessary to enable them to take the Conclusive Grounds decision at the second meeting and ensure every effort is made to obtain that evidence. Where the Pilot Site is aware that further relevant information will be available at a later date e.g. a medical assessment or police report, the site should ensure that information is obtained for the second meeting.</p>

<p>1.33	The Conclusive Grounds decision will be taken in consultation with all professionals involved in the support and care of the child/ young person present at the YPSPCC.</p>

<p>1.34	The Young Person Support &amp; Protection (YPSP) conference will include, where appropriate, the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian who will be a full participant in the meeting. The Scottish Guardianship Service provide specialist independent support through a guardian to children and young people who are or may have been trafficked, or at risk of trafficking, for whom no-one in the UK holds parental rights or responsibilities. The guardian helps these children and young people to navigate the immigration and welfare processes. Where appropriate the guardian will attend a Young Person Support &amp; Protection (YPSP) conference and be a full participant in the meeting to share information, but given they are not a statutory service they must not participate in the final decision-making.</p>

<h2>Weight to give to expert reports</h2>

<p>1.35	Potential victims of trafficking may rely on documentary evidence to support their claim in the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).</p>

<p>1.36	The experience and qualifications of the individual providing the supporting evidence and the sources used will be relevant in considering what weight to attach to an expert report and every case must be considered on its merits</p>

<p>1.37	Expert evidence is not determinative of whether the Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds test is met but should be taken into account when reaching a conclusion on whether there are reasons why the Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds test is or is not met. There is no requirement to accept an assessment of an expert; any expert assessment should be considered in the round with all other information.</p>

<p>1.38	The individual writing the report may not have access to the full range of information available to the Pilot Site and all relevant evidence, including any documentary evidence, must be considered when making a Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.39	Where an expert report is considered when assessing a claim under the NRM, and other information is available, all the information and relevant reports should be considered. If there are several expert reports all must be taken into account. A decision should not rely on an expert report alone without considering all relevant information.</p>

<p>1.40	A decision should not rely on an expert report alone where there is other relevant information available. The Pilot Site should consider all available evidence, and an expert report should be considered and weighted appropriately alongside other evidence.</p>

<p>1.41	Where a potential victim relies on medical evidence, it should be from a medical or health professional who is qualified in the appropriate field, including information such as the relevant physical or mental condition, when that condition has been diagnosed, and why that condition or any treatment relating to it is relevant to human trafficking and exploitation.</p>

<p>1.42	The Pilot Site will not make a determination on a potential victim’s nationality. The purpose of the NRM is to identify and support victims of trafficking. However, the Pilot Site will consider evidence from a range of sources to enable a holistic assessment of a potential victim’s case which may include consideration of the potential victim’s claimed nationality for the purposes of their case and the claims they are a victim.</p>

<p>1.43	Any evidence supplied must be capable of being verified by the Pilot Site where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Insufficient evidence</h2>

<p>1.44	Where there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the individual is a victim of trafficking, Pilot Sites are entitled to question whether the Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is met.</p>

<p>1.45	Decision makers at Pilot Sites should consider what information they hold that may be relevant to a decision and ensure that is shared with other decision-makers at a multi-agency meeting to ensure all relevant information is considered.</p>

<h2>Assessing victims who were exploited overseas or historic claims</h2>

<p>1.46	While a victim must be physically in the UK in order to enter the NRM, the fact that a victim has been exploited outside of the UK does not preclude the Pilot Site from making a decision.</p>

<p>1.47	A child who says they have been a victim of trafficking overseas should be assessed on the same basis as a child who states they have been a victim of  trafficking in the UK. Although they may be far removed from their situation of trafficking, they may still have been subjected to exploitation and may therefore be considered a victim of trafficking. They may also still be traumatised by their experience even in historic cases.</p>

<p>1.48	A person may have been exploited some time ago and the situation of exploitation is now over. These scenarios are often referred to as historic claims as they might be referred to the NRM long after the exploitation has ended. The Pilot Site should still make a decision on whether the person is a victim of trafficking if the case is referred in to the NRM and in scope of the pilot, as the NRM decisions are not an assessment of future harm but a retrospective finding of fact as to whether the individual is a victim of trafficking. It is worth noting that the YPSP conference will also consider future risk of harm.</p>

<p>1.49	The Pilot Site must offer potential victims of historic claims the same support and protection extended to victims of trafficking while their case is considered within the NRM.</p>

<h2>How a referral is made</h2>

<p>1.50	Human trafficking and exploitation is a child protection issue and child protection procedures will take precedence in any referral in line with National Child Protection Guidance.</p>

<p>1.51	Where a potential victim of trafficking is identified, Social Work services will notify SCA and contact Police Scotland and Health Services to arrange an IRD.  The SCA will also be notified of the outcome of the IRD which could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No further action required in relation to trafficking</li>
  <li>Reasonable Grounds decision</li>
</ul>

<p>1.52	Where Police Scotland are the referring agency, they will submit a referral to Social Work Services and any safety planning under child protection procedures will be agreed. Police Scotland will at the same time notify the SCA and the National Human Trafficking Unit.</p>

<p>1.53	Where Police Scotland is the First Responder, the referral will detail if the child is potentially subject to criminal proceedings and any timescale in which a Conclusive Grounds Decision is required for the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>1.54	When a First Responder believes a child is a potential victim of trafficking, they will submit a referral to the SCA, who will log the referral. This referral will be shared with the Pilot Site as appropriate.</p>

<h2>Validating and acknowledging a referral</h2>

<p>1.55	Staff at the SCA will validate an NRM referral. The process SCA staff will follow is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check whether the referral is a duplicate or refers to an existing case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check there is sufficient information contained in the referral. If not, the SCA staff will swiftly contact the First Responder Organisation for more information and any other agencies involved with details supplied as part of the referral.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the potential victim has any immigration history on the Home Office Case Information Database (CID), check that they have been identified as having a ‘Potential Victim of Trafficking’ special condition. If not, the SCA will add this to the record and raise a barrier to removal if this is not already in place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check whether the referral is eligible to be part of the Pilot Programme; whether the safeguarding responsibility for the child falls to one of the Local Authorities involved in the Pilot Programme, whether the child is more than 100 days from their 18th birthday or where there is doubt as to whether the individual is a child.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to referring the case to the Pilot Site; the SCA will acknowledge it has received the referral form by sending an acknowledgement notification to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The First Responder</li>
  <li>Police Scotland</li>
  <li>Social Worker. If there is no social worker listed on the referral form in a case involving a potential child victim, the SCA will contact the relevant Local Authority</li>
  <li>Police Scotland’s National Human Trafficking Unit</li>
  <li>Scottish Guardianship Service in cases involving children where this provision is available and the SCA has been notified of their involvement. The SCA will ensure all relevant updates on SCA databases are made.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making a decision</h2>

<p>1.56	This section sets out the process the Pilot Site will follow when making a Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.57	The Pilot Site needs to assess if all information available meets the definition of human trafficking and exploitation when making a Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds decision. When undertaking an assessment, the Pilot Site will consider all the information available to support decision making objectively. Analysis of the information and evidence available to the Pilot Site in its assessment will inform a decision that a child is a potential victim of trafficking.</p>

<p>1.58	In carrying out the assessment, the Pilot Site will recognise that victims of trafficking have been through trauma which may impact on the information they provide. The Pilot Site will take cognisance of inconsistent accounts within the context of trauma informed practice.</p>

<h2>Timescale for decisions</h2>

<p>1.59	The Pilot Site will convene an IRD on receipt of referral where Social Work, Police Scotland, NHS (and Education where appropriate and in line with IRD Guidance) will undertake the Reasonable Grounds Decision.</p>

<p>1.60	Where there is sufficient information, the IRD may also make a positive Conclusive Grounds decision at the same time the Reasonable Grounds decision is taken.</p>

<p>1.61	Where the Reasonable Grounds decision is positive, but the IRD does not have sufficient information to make a positive Conclusive grounds decision, the IRD will recommend that a YPSP Conference is arranged to consider the Conclusive Grounds decision within 45 calendar days of the IRD.</p>

<p>1.62	Where there is sufficient evidence to support a decision, the Pilot Site will inform the SCA of the decision. The SCA will then advise all relevant parties. Where there is not sufficient evidence to take a decision, conference participants should agree what further evidence is required and the steps needed to obtain it.</p>

<p>1.63	If the child is subject to criminal proceedings, the Pilot Site should consider the child’s case as a matter of urgency and, where possible, in line with the timescales of the Criminal Justice System. The Piot Site will inform the SCA as soon as the decision is made. The SCA will inform all interested parties. However, a decision should still only be made where there is sufficient information available to do so.</p>

<p>1.64	The Pilot Site may receive a request to delay making a Conclusive Grounds decision; for example, until an interested party can submit further information deemed relevant to a case. The Pilot Site should consider the circumstances of the request, whether the additional information is required for the decision, and as such whether it is appropriate to wait rather than proceeding with a decision. If the child is subject to potential criminal proceedings, then the timescales of the criminal justice system should form part of the consideration of the request to delay. The Pilot Site must discuss the request with the SCA, who must inform the victim of the outcome of the request to delay and provide reasons if the request is refused.</p>

<h2>Standard of proof for Reasonable Grounds decision</h2>

<p>1.65	When the Pilot Site receives a referral, they must decide whether on the information available it is reasonable to believe that a person is a victim of trafficking, servitude and forced or compulsory labour.</p>

<p>1.66	The test the pilot must apply is whether the statement below is true -</p>

<p>‘I suspect but cannot prove’ the person is a victim of trafficking or (slavery, servitude, or forced or compulsory labour)’</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>whether a reasonable person, having regard to the information in the mind of the decision maker, would think there are Reasonable Grounds to believe the individual is a victim of human trafficking (or slavery, servitude, or forced or compulsory labour)</p>

<p>1.67	It may not be initially clear to the Pilot Site whether a potential victim has been subject to human trafficking or slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labour. To reach a positive Reasonable Grounds decision the Pilot Site needs to assess on the information available that it is reasonable to believe that a person is a victim of trafficking. At the Reasonable Grounds stage, the Pilot Site does not need to distinguish which form of exploitation they have experienced.</p>

<p>1.68	Reasonable suspicion would not normally be met on the basis of an unsubstantiated claim alone, without reliable, credible, precise and up to date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intelligence or information</li>
  <li>evidence of some specific behaviour by the person concerned</li>
</ul>

<p>1.69	The Reasonable Grounds decision has significant consequences for the potential victim in terms of protection and support (and potential further stay in the UK if they are subject to immigration control). It is important that the decision is of the highest possible standard and takes all available evidence into account when reaching the decision, including the expert views of those surrounding the individual. The following information should be considered where available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reference to the indicators of trafficking and exploitation in the referral</li>
  <li>intelligence or information from law enforcement agencies, including objective country of origin evidence</li>
  <li>information from First Responders, support organisations, social services and persons involved in assisting the victim</li>
  <li>evidence of some specific behaviour by the person concerned</li>
  <li>information available to local safeguarding partners involved in the decision-making process</li>
  <li>information provided by the Home Office, for example, in relation to an asylum claim</li>
  <li>any other relevant information available to the Pilot Site</li>
</ul>

<p>1.70	This is a non-exhaustive list and there may be additional information that is relevant. Where reliable, credible, precise and up-to-date intelligence, information or evidence is present and relevant, it must be considered in reaching a Reasonable Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.71	If a person is a victim of trafficking then they are a victim of a crime. It is not necessary for a victim to cooperate with a criminal case in order to obtain a Reasonable Grounds decision. The Pilot Site can explore information about the alleged offence as part of the Reasonable Grounds assessment. The absence of such information should not be taken as an indication that someone is not a victim as there may be a range of reasons why information cannot be obtained from Police Scotland, for example, if exploitation occurred abroad.</p>

<p>1.72	It is not necessary to prove that an offence has taken place, or for there to be an ongoing criminal investigation to find that an individual is a victim of trafficking or slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory labour.</p>

<p>1.73	Pilot Sites must remember it is not possible for a child to give informed consent to engage in criminal or other exploitative activity, nor can they give consent to be abused or trafficked. The decision-maker therefore does not need to consider the means by which they were trafficked (such as fraud, force or coercion), as they would in adult trafficking cases, as it is not possible for a child to consent to this. When considering cases, Pilot Sites should bear in mind the child’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added vulnerability</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>possible grooming by the perpetrator</li>
</ul>

<p>1.74	Pilot Sites should ensure the relevant individuals from Children’s Social Services are aware of the case and have had the opportunity to contribute information if not involved directly in the decision-making process.</p>

<h2>Standard of proof for Conclusive Grounds decision</h2>

<p>1.75	At the Conclusive Grounds decision stage, the decision-maker must consider whether, ‘on the balance of probabilities’, there is sufficient information to decide if the individual is a victim of trafficking.</p>

<p>On ‘the balance of probabilities’, this person is a victim of trafficking or (slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour)</p>

<p>1.76	The ‘balance of probabilities’ essentially means that, based on the evidence available, trafficking is more likely than not to have happened. This standard of proof does not require the Pilot Site to be certain that the event occurred.</p>

<p>1.77	In reaching their decision the Pilot Site must weigh the balance of probabilities by considering the whole human trafficking and exploitation process and the different and interrelated actions that need to have taken place. To make their decision, they must weigh the strength of the information presented including the credibility of the information and use common sense and logic based on the particular circumstances of each case, to form a view as to the credibility of the information presented.</p>

<p>1.78	There may be insufficient information in the NRM Referral Form and the information available to decision-makers for a Pilot Site to make a Conclusive Grounds decision at the same time as a Reasonable Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.79	If the Pilot Site cannot make a Conclusive Grounds decision within 45 days on the evidence available, they should schedule a second meeting no later than 45 days after the meeting at which the reasonable grounds decision was made and consider what evidence will be needed to take the Conclusive Grounds decision. This may include requesting further information from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The First Responder Organisation</li>
  <li>Scottish Guardianship Service</li>
  <li>Any other organisation known to have relevant information</li>
</ul>

<p>1.80	The Pilot Site will seek information from other support providers or other persons involved in assisting the child/young person where appropriate. In cases where it is likely that the person will be issued a negative Conclusive Grounds decision, the Pilot Site should ensure all relevant information has been considered.</p>

<p>1.81	Some of the indicators on the referral form may not be apparent on the initial contact but may become clear later, for example during any subsequent interviews with an interpreter and/or at a safe location. The Pilot Site should be mindful of any ongoing process which may provide additional information.</p>

<p>1.82	The Pilot Site must also take into account any expert reports submitted, particularly those from qualified health practitioners.</p>

<p>1.83	The Pilot Site should also take into account objective country of origin information and other published information from a trusted source relating to known or emerging patterns of human trafficking and exploitation.</p>

<p>1.84	If the Pilot Site has sufficient evidence to make a positive Conclusive Grounds decision at the same time it makes a positive Reasonable Grounds decision it should do so immediately. The child will continue to receive a 90-calendar day Recovery Period from the date of the Reasonable Grounds decision. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993172/Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.3.pdf" rel="external">Modern Slavery: Statutory Guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and Non-Statutory Guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland</a> for more information on the Recovery Period.</p>

<p>1.85	Pilot Sites must remember it is not possible for a child to give informed consent to engage in criminal or other exploitative activity, nor can they give consent to be abused or trafficked. The decision-maker does not need to consider the means by which they were trafficked (such as fraud, force or coercion), as they would in adult trafficking cases, as it is not possible for a child to consent to this.</p>

<p>1.86	The pilot will follow the GIRFEC principles and framework to ensure a holistic assessment of the child or young person</p>

<h2>Recording a decision</h2>

<p>1.87	As part of the decision-making process, Pilot Sites will complete the recording template and return this, with any evidence relied upon to reach the decision, to the SCA. This should be done for both Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions. Where both decisions are taken in the same meeting, only one template is required. Where appropriate, the Pilot Site should specify where information is not disclosable in a Subject Access Request.</p>

<p>1.88	The YPSP conference decisions will be contained in the 24hr decision letter (which is the framework of the child’s plan compiled at the end of a conference. The 24hr decision letter will not include any Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decisions as these will be issued by the SCA. The child’s plan will include any interventions and actions required to meet the safety and wellbeing needs of the child. The YPSP will make Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds NRM decisions and these will be made as part of the Pilot Programme, recognising that the ability to make NRM decisions is not a current delegated function to GCC.</p>

<p>1.89	The SCA will record the outcome of the decision on appropriate Home Office databases and issue any required decision letters or other communications.</p>

<h2>Multi-Agency Assurance Panels (MAAPs)</h2>

<p>1.90	The MAAPs process will continue to apply to negative Conclusive Grounds decisions made by Pilot Sites. This is fully detailed in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993172/Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.3.pdf" rel="external">Modern Slavery: Statutory Guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and Non-Statutory Guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland</a></p>

<h2>Actions for the Single Competent Authority following a National Referral Mechanism decision (Reasonable and/or Conclusive Grounds)</h2>

<p>1.91	For the duration of the Pilot Programme, the SCA will continue to issue decisions relating to the NRM once all the appropriate processes have been completed, e.g. MAAPs have reviewed a negative Conclusive Grounds decision</p>

<p>1.92	In all NRM cases, when a decision is made, the SCA must take the following actions</p>

<h3>Action 1: Record the decision</h3>

<p>1.93	The SCA must update the SCA records when any of the following occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Positive or Negative Reasonable Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>Positive Reasonable Grounds and positive Conclusive Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>Positive or Negative Conclusive Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>A MAAP panel has reviewed a Negative Conclusive Grounds decision</li>
  <li>A reconsideration is requested</li>
  <li>A decision is suspended or withdrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>1.94	In all cases the SCA will record the outcome of the Pilot Programme decisions and the evidence relied upon using the reporting template.</p>

<p>1.95	The SCA should complete the appropriate decision letter for the case outcome.</p>

<p>1.96	For a negative decision, the SCA must include a copy of their consideration minute providing full details of what they have considered, where they believe there are gaps in information and explaining their decision.</p>

<p>1.97	Any decision letter from the SCA should be issued to the allocated social worker who will share with the relevant parties including the child/ young person and the Scottish Guardianship Service where appropriate.</p>

<p>1.98	The SCA must not serve a decision letter or other trafficking papers on a child under any circumstances. All trafficking papers must be served on the child’s appointed representative or the Local Authority, as well as, where appropriate, the Scottish Guardianship Service.</p>

<h3>Action 3: Notify other relevant agencies of the decision</h3>

<p>1.99	The SCA must notify the following of their decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The First Responder and / or First Responder Organisation (in all cases)</li>
  <li>Social Work Services</li>
  <li>The Scottish Guardianship Service where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.100	The SCA should update the Home Office databases as appropriate (e.g. NRM referral case type, special condition, removal barrier), noting that the minimum 90 day recovery period must be observed.</p>

<p>1.101	The SCA should update Police Scotland following a Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988810/May_2021_-_Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.2.pdf" rel="external">Information sharing between the SCA and the police</a>.</p>

<h3>Action 4: Notify law enforcement (where criminal proceedings are involved)</h3>

<p>1.102	If the individual is the subject of criminal proceedings the SCA must contact Police Scotland as soon as the NRM decision is made.</p>

<p>1.103	The SCA must ensure that Police Scotland’s National Human Trafficking Unit is notified of the NRM decision as soon as they make it. This is done by sending a copy of the notification letter or contacting them by email or telephone as appropriate.	  The National Human Trafficking Unit will update G Division Trafficking Unit.</p>

<p>1.104	The Police Scotland will notify the Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland of the NRM decision as soon as they receive it.</p>

<p>1.105	The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will apply the Lord Advocate’s Instructions to prosecutors when considering prosecution of victims of trafficking to ensure that child victims of  trafficking who may have committed criminal offences, as a consequence of their exploitation, are not prosecuted. Further information can be found in Section 8 of the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act 2015 and Lord Advocate’s Instructions for Prosecutors when considering Prosecution of Victims of Human Trafficking and Exploitation</p>

<h2>Actions for the Single Competent Authority when a National Referral Mechanism decision is suspended</h2>

<p>1.106	Actions for the SCA in a suspended case will continue as set out in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993172/Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.3.pdf" rel="external">Modern Slavery: Statutory Guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and Non-Statutory Guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>1.107 The SCA and Pilot Site will agree an appropriate course of action on a case-by-case basis if they believe a case may need to be suspended. If any of the following occur, a Pilot Site will be expected to notify the SCA as soon as reasonably possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the child dies, goes missing, or is arrested</li>
  <li>there is a change in the local authority responsible for the child</li>
  <li>there is a criminal trial date set ahead of the expected decision date</li>
</ul>

<p>1.108	The Pilot Site will notify the SCA if they become aware of any other reason why a decision may need to be suspended.</p>

<h2>Actions for the Single Competent Authority in live immigration cases following a National Referral Mechanism decision</h2>

<p>1.109	Actions for the SCA in relation to immigration cases will continue as set out in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993172/Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.3.pdf" rel="external">Modern Slavery: Statutory Guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and Non-Statutory Guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</a></p>

<h2>Single Competent Authority case record</h2>

<p>1.110 An SCA case record must be kept by SCA staff.</p>

<p>1.111	When human trafficking and exploitation cases are concluded, all SCA case records must, at a minimum, contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Responder referral form</li>
  <li>Decision letter(s)</li>
  <li>Decision Templates from Pilot Sites and accompanying evidence
    <ul>
      <li>[where Conclusive Grounds decision is negative] record of the MAAP decision where relevant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>details of referrals to other relevant organisations, e.g. police / Scottish Guardianship Service</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disclosure of information to the victim and right of access requests</h2>

<p>1.112	Pilot Sites will be data processors for the purpose of NRM data. As such, if a right of access request is raised with a Pilot Site, the SCA as data controller should be notified. 
1.113	The outcome of Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions will always be disclosed to victims (or an appropriate representative for the child) as a matter of course.</p>

<p>1.114	Victims can request access to the information held about them by the SCA, as data controller, in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR. Requests for information should be submitted in writing. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/" rel="external">Templates to assist with requesting this information are available from the Information Commissioner’s Office</a>.</p>

<p>Section 15 of the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2015 allows for exemptions from right of access requests as set out in Schedule 2 of the DPA 2015. These exemptions include for 2(1)(a) the prevention of a crime, and 2(1)(b) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. As such, where there is sensitive information in the referral form or decision minute, this should be redacted before the records are released. Examples of sensitive information that may not be released, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information about police or other law enforcement investigations</li>
  <li>Information regarding other victims</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tribunal requests</h2>

<p>1.115	Actions for the Single Competent Authority (SCA) in relation to Tribunal Requests cases will continue as set out in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/993172/Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.3.pdf" rel="external">Modern Slavery: Statutory Guidance for England and Wales (under s49 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015) and Non-Statutory Guidance for Scotland and Northern Ireland.</a></p>

<h2>Reconsideration of Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision</h2>

<p>1.116	An individual, or someone acting on their behalf, may request reconsideration of a negative Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision if additional evidence becomes available that would be material to the outcome of a case, or there are specific concerns that a decision made is not in line with guidance.</p>

<p>1.117	If the Pilot Site receives a request for a reconsideration, the SCA should be informed as soon as reasonably possible. The SCA will inform the relevant Pilot if the SCA receives a request for a reconsideration relating to a decision a Pilot Site has made.</p>

<p>1.118	The SCA and Pilot Site will discuss the merits of the reconsideration request, but the SCA will have the final decision as to whether the case should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>1.119	If the SCA determines a case should be reconsidered, the SCA will determine whether the Pilot Site or the SCA is best placed to reconsider the decision.</p>

<p>1.120	Full details on reconsideration request are set out in the original Annex E.</p>

<h2>Improper claims and public order</h2>

<p>1.121	The Recovery Period will not be observed if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grounds of public order prevent it</li>
  <li>it is found that victim status was claimed improperly</li>
</ul>

<p>1.122	If a Pilot Site believes a claim has been made improperly or that there a public order concerns regarding a victim, the Pilot Site should notify the SCA of any concerns.</p>

<p>1.123	Where the SCA determines that there is firm, objective evidence that an improper claim has been made, as soon as this becomes known, the SCA must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>issue a negative Conclusive Grounds decision</li>
  <li>curtail any remaining Recovery Period and notify the appropriate immigration unit for them to consider taking action as appropriate (if the person has any outstanding leave due to another immigration application this may continue to run unless found to have been claimed improperly also).</li>
</ul>

<p>1.124	If the evidence of an improper claim is not firm and objective as determined by the SCA, the Pilot Site must follow standard processes and observe the full Recovery Period.</p>

<p>1.125	It is also possible that an individual who initially claimed to be a victim of trafficking could be involved in the human trafficking of others. These cases must immediately be referred to the police or the Home Office criminal investigation team of Immigration Enforcement for appropriate action.</p>

<h2>Revocation of Conclusive Grounds decision</h2>

<p>1.126	Where the SCA or a Pilot Site has made a positive Conclusive Grounds decision, but information later comes to light which suggests that the decision was flawed, the SCA should consider whether revocation is appropriate.</p>

<p>1.127	Where the decision has been made by a Pilot Site, the SCA will discuss their concerns with the Pilot Site who made the decision to determine whether a revocation is appropriate. It will be for the SCA to make the final determination, but this will not happen before concerns have been discussed with the Pilot Site.</p>

<p>1.128	If it is determined that it is appropriate to revoke the Conclusive Grounds decision, the SCA caseworker must write to the individual concerned, or an appropriate representative. If it is not possible to make contact directly with the individual concerned in an appropriate way, the SCA should contact their legal representative (where known) and/or their most recent support provider under the Victim Care Contract (where engaged), or equivalent support providers in Northern Ireland and Scotland, to seek to regain contact.</p>

<p>1.129	If the individual has been issued a period of Discretionary Leave, the SCA must notify the appropriate immigration team for them to consider whether curtailment of this leave is appropriate.</p>

<h2>Withdrawing from the National Referral Mechanism</h2>

<p>1.130	Children may not withdraw themselves from the NRM. A child may not be withdrawn from the NRM unless it is in the best interests of the child as determined by the responsible Local Authority Child Safeguarding Services. If the SCA receives a request from a Local Authority or embassy, for example, seeking that a child be withdrawn from the NRM, the case should be referred to the Modern Slavery Unit for advice.</p>
