<p>1.1. Please note this Annex applies for all Pilot Sites across England and Wales. Separate guidance applies in Scotland.</p>

<p>1.2.This Annex provides detailed guidance for decision makers in the
Devolving Child Decision-Making Pilot Programme. It replaces Annex E of
the Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory Guidance for the purposes of
making decisions within the Devolving Child Decision-Making Pilot
Programme.</p>

<p>1.3.Definitions of different forms of modern slavery (human trafficking,
slavery, servitude, and forced and/or compulsory labour) continue to be
set out in Annex B of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory Guidance</a>
and are remain unchanged for the purposes of the Pilot Programme.</p>

<h3>Defined Terms</h3>

<p>1.4. In this guidance the following defined terms are used in addition to the
defined terms set out in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory Guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Devolving Child Decision-Making Pilot Programme (the ‘Pilot
Programme’) refers to the ten Pilot Sites taking decisions regarding
potential child victims of modern slavery as defined in this document. The
programme will run for 12 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pilot Sites refers to the local authorities participating in the Pilot
Programme and their safeguarding partners</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assessing credibility and other evidence during the decision-making process</h3>

<p>1.5. Pilot Sites need to assess whether a potential victim’s account of modern
slavery is credible when making a Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive
Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.6. Good practice in working with victims who have experienced trauma
should be observed. See the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Working with vulnerable people</a>
for more information. However, the need to take into account the impact
trauma is likely to have on the individual’s ability to recall events does not remove the need to assess all information critically and objectively when considering the credibility of a case.</p>

<h4>Assessing credibility</h4>

<p>1.7. Pilot Sites are entitled to consider credibility as part of their decision-making process at both the Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds stages. When Pilot Sites are assessing the credibility of an
account, they must consider both the external and internal credibility of
the material facts.</p>

<p>1.8. If they fit the definition of human trafficking or slavery, servitude, and
forced or compulsory labour, there is reliable supporting evidence and the
account is credible to the required standard of proof, the Pilot Site should
recognise the person as being a victim of modern slavery.</p>

<h3>Mitigating circumstances</h3>

<p>1.9. It is important for the Pilot Site to assess all information critically and
objectively when the Pilot Site considers the credibility of a case, but it is
also vital for decision makers to have an understanding of the mitigating
reasons why a potential victim of modern slavery is incoherent,
inconsistent or delays giving details of material facts.</p>

<p>1.10. Throughout this process it is important to remember that victims of
modern slavery have been through trauma, and that this may impact on
the information they provide. Due to the trauma of modern slavery, there
may be valid reasons why a potential victim’s account is inconsistent or
lacks sufficient detail. Pilot Sites should have account of any relevant
factors set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Working with vulnerable people</a> section when making
a decision as this section outlines some of the challenges victims may
face in providing a clear and consistent account of their experiences. The
Pilot Site should take these reasons into account when considering the
credibility of a claim.</p>

<p>1.11. The Pilot Site must keep in mind the child’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added vulnerability</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>possible grooming by the traffickers and exploiters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Materiality</h3>

<p>1.12. In assessing credibility the Pilot Site should assess the material facts of
past and present events (material facts being those which are serious and
significant in nature) which may indicate that a person is a victim of
modern slavery. It is generally unnecessary, and sometimes counterproductive, to focus on minor or peripheral facts that are not material to the claim.</p>

<p>1.13. The Pilot Site should assess the material facts based on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are they coherent and consistent with any past written or verbal statements?</li>
  <li>how well does the evidence submitted fit together and does it contradict itself?</li>
  <li>are they consistent with claims made by witnesses and with any documentary evidence submitted in support of the claim or gathered during the course of your investigations?</li>
</ul>

<p>1.14. Where there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the
individual is a victim of modern slavery (for example where the case is
lacking key details, such as who exploited them or where the exploitation
took place) staff at the Pilot Site is entitled to question whether the
Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is met. However, if
the Reasonable Grounds threshold is met Pilot Sites must also consider
whether they are able to make a positive Conclusive Grounds decision on
the evidence they have available, or if they need more information before
making a Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<h3>Level of Detail</h3>

<p>1.15. The level of detail with which a potential victim presents their claim is a
factor when the Pilot Site assesses credibility. It is reasonable to assume
that a victim giving an account of their modern slavery experience will be
more expressive and more likely to include sensory details (for example
what they saw, heard, felt or thought about an event) than someone who
has not had this experience. However, some traumatised individuals can
struggle to verbally express distressing experiences, may appear numb or
disconnected from their words or display other trauma-related responses.</p>

<p>1.16. Where there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the
individual is a victim of modern slavery the Pilot Site is entitled to question
whether the Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is
met.</p>

<h3>Consistency</h3>

<p>1.17. It is also reasonable to assume that a potential victim who has
experienced an event will be able to recount the central elements in a
broadly consistent manner. A potential victim’s inability to remain
consistent throughout their written and oral accounts of past and current
events may lead the Pilot Site to disbelieve their claim. However, before
the Pilot Site comes to a negative conclusion they should consider
whether they are able to access further information which could clarify
inconsistencies in the claim including whether the First Responder should
be provided with the opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>1.18. Due to the trauma of modern slavery, there may be valid reasons why
a potential victim’s account is inconsistent or lacks sufficient detail. The
Pilot Site should take account of any evidence of mitigating circumstances
that could explain the inconsistency.</p>

<h3>Considering gender and culture</h3>

<p>1.19. Pilot Sites should know how to consider gender and cultural issues in
considering credibility.</p>

<p>1.20. It is important to understand that distress presents differently in
different cultures and that cultural understanding of many situations is
variable.</p>

<p>1.21. When making Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions
the Pilot Site must take into account the individual position and personal
circumstances of the person and consider cultural or gender issues.</p>

<p>1.22. Individuals from the same country of origin may have different
experiences due to their cultural, ethnic, gender and sexual identity. For
example, women may be unable to disclose relevant details due to
cultural and social norms.</p>

<h3>Relevance of potential prosecution of exploiters</h3>

<p>1.23. Pilot Sites need to know about how prosecution of their exploiters could
impact a victim of modern slavery’s Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive
Grounds decisions.</p>

<p>1.24. When the Pilot Site is deciding whether there are Reasonable or
Conclusive Grounds that a person is a victim of modern slavery, their
decision may be influenced by whether the alleged exploiter is being
prosecuted. However, the Pilot Site’s decision must not be dependent on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there being a criminal investigation</li>
  <li>whether the victim cooperates in any criminal proceedings</li>
</ul>

<p>1.25. The victim identification process is independent of any criminal
proceedings against those responsible for the modern slavery. The
criminal standard of proof, that is ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’, is higher
than that of the Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds test.</p>

<p>1.26. Pilot Sites must be aware that any information recorded as part of a
Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds decision could be disclosed during a
prosecution or a Subject Access Request.</p>

<h3>View of other experts during Pilot Site decision making</h3>

<p>1.27. A Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision may be
influenced by the views of experts. Pilot Sites should ensure experts
involved in decision making share relevant information as appropriate and
consider the views of other experts not directly involved in decision
making where available. These experts could include qualified medical
experts, ICTGs or ICTG Regional Practice Coordinators, the Northern
Ireland Independent Guardian Service, Scottish Guardianship Service, the
police, social workers and other Local Authority experts, and support
providers.</p>

<p>1.28. Pilot Sites must give due weight and regard to the reports and views of
the ICTG Direct Workers or ICTG Regional Practice Coordinator (where
appointed) <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Due to their independence these agencies cannot be directly
involved in decision making but must be invited and provided with the
opportunity to take part in all meetings and discussions which relate to
and impact upon the child.</p>

<p>1.29. These organisations may have spent the most time with the potential
victim and established a degree of trust. Victims may not trust or be afraid
of the police or immigration officials. They may therefore not be willing to
provide statements to law enforcement. In such circumstances nongovernmental organisations may be able to provide more information on the individual’s situation and the decision makers must consider any such
supporting evidence. The Pilot Sites must also take into account any
expert reports submitted, particularly those from qualified health
practitioners.</p>

<h3>Weight to give to expert reports</h3>

<p>1.30. Potential victims of modern slavery may rely on documentary evidence
to support their claim in the NRM.</p>

<p>1.31. The experience and qualifications of the individual providing the
supporting evidence and the sources used will be relevant in considering
what weight to attach to an expert report and every case must be
considered on its merits.</p>

<p>1.32. Expert evidence is not determinative of whether the Reasonable or
Conclusive Ground test is met but should be taken into account when
reaching a conclusion on whether there are reasons why the Reasonable
or Conclusive Grounds test is or is not met. There is no requirement to
accept an assessment of an expert that a person is or is not a victim. Any
expert assessment must be considered in the round with all other
evidence.</p>

<p>1.33. The individual writing the report may not have access to the full range
of information available to the Pilot Site and all relevant evidence, including any documentary evidence, must be considered when making a Reasonable or Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.34. Where an expert report is considered when assessing a claim under
the NRM, and other information is available, all the information and
relevant reports should be considered. If there are several expert reports
all must be taken into account. A decision should not rely on an expert
report alone without considering all relevant information.</p>

<p>1.35. A decision should not rely on an expert report alone where there is
other relevant information available. The Pilot Site should consider all
available evidence, and an expert report should be considered and
weighted appropriately alongside other evidence.</p>

<p>1.36. Where a potential victim of modern slavery relies on medical evidence
it should be from a medical professional who is qualified in the appropriate
field including information such as the relevant physical or mental
condition, when that condition has been diagnosed and why that condition
or any treatment relating to it is relevant to modern slavery.</p>

<p>1.37. The Pilot Site will not make a determination on a potential victim’s
nationality. The purpose of the NRM is to identify and support victims of
modern slavery. However, the Pilot Site will consider evidence from a
range of sources and assess the credibility of a potential victim’s case
which may include consideration of the potential victim’s claimed
nationality for the purposes of their case and the claims they are a victim.</p>

<p>1.38. Any evidence supplied must be capable of being verified by the Pilot
Site where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Insufficient evidence</h3>

<p>1.39. Where there is insufficient evidence to support a claim that the
individual is a victim of modern slavery, Pilot Sites are entitled to question
whether the Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds threshold is
met.</p>

<p>1.40. Decision makers at Pilot Sites should consider what information they
hold that may be relevant to a decision and ensure that is shared with
other decision-makers at a multi-agency meeting to ensure all relevant
information is considered.</p>

<h3>Assessing victims who were exploited overseas or historic claims</h3>

<p>1.41. While a victim must be physically in the UK in order to enter the NRM,
the fact that a victim has been exploited outside of the UK does not
preclude the Pilot Site from making a determination.</p>

<p>1.42. A child who says they have been a victim of modern slavery overseas
should be assessed on the same basis as a child who states they have
been a victim of modern slavery in the UK.</p>

<p>1.43. Although they may be far removed from their situation of modern
slavery, they may still have been subjected to exploitation and may
therefore be considered a victim of modern slavery. They may also still be
traumatised by their experience even in historic cases.</p>

<p>1.44. Similarly, a child may have been exploited some time ago and the
situation of exploitation is now over. These scenarios are often referred to
as historic claims as they might be referred to the NRM long after the
exploitation has ended. The Pilot Site should still make a determination on
whether the child is a victim of modern slavery if the case is referred in to
the NRM and in scope of the pilot, as the NRM decisions are not an
assessment of future harm but a finding of fact as to whether the
individual is a victim of modern slavery.</p>

<p>1.45. The Pilot Site must offer potential victims of historic claims the support
and protection extended to victims of modern slavery while their modern
slavery case is considered within the NRM.</p>

<h3>How a referral is made</h3>

<p>1.46. When a First Responder believes a child is a potential victim of modern
slavery, they will submit a referral to the Single Competent Authority
(SCA), who will log the referral. This referral will be shared with the Pilot
Site as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Validating and acknowledging a referral</h3>

<p>1.47. Staff at the SCA will validate a NRM referral. The process SCA staff
will follow is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check whether the referral is a duplicate or refers to an existing case</li>
  <li>check there is sufficient information contained in the referral. If not, the
SCA staff will contact the First Responder Organisation for more
information and any other agencies involved with details supplied as part
of the referral</li>
  <li>if the potential victim has any immigration history on the Home Office
Case Information Database (CID), check that they have been identified
as having a ‘Potential Victim of Trafficking’ special condition. If not, the
SCA will add this to the record and raise a barrier to removal if this is not
already in place</li>
  <li>check whether the referral is eligible to be part of the pilot programme;
whether the safeguarding responsibility for the child falls to one of the local authorities involved in the pilot programme and whether the child is more than 100 days from their 18th birthday</li>
  <li>In addition to referring the case to the Pilot Site; the SCA will acknowledge it has received the referral form by sending an acknowledgement notification to:
    <ul>
      <li>the First Responder</li>
      <li>the Social Worker. If there is no social worker listed on the referral form in a case involving a potential child victim the SCA will contact the relevant Local Authority Safeguarding Children Service in England and Wales, the equivalent Local Authority service in Scotland, or Children’s Safeguarding Teams within Health &amp; Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland</li>
      <li>the relevant police force (or Police Scotland’s National Human Trafficking Unit)</li>
      <li>the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian in England and Wales, the Northern Ireland Independent Guardian Service or Scottish Guardianship Service in cases involving children where this provision is available and the SCA has been notified of their involvement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the SCA will ensure all relevant updates on SCA databases are made</li>
</ul>

<h3>Making a decision</h3>

<p>1.48. This section sets out the process Pilot Sites will follow when making a Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<h4>Timescale for decisions</h4>

<p>1.49. The expectation is that the Pilot Sites will make a Reasonable Grounds
decision within 45 calendar days of the NRM referral being received by
the Pilot Site.</p>

<p>1.50. Where there is sufficient information, Pilot Sites may also make a
positive Conclusive Grounds decision at the same multi-agency meeting
where the Reasonable Grounds decision is taken.</p>

<p>1.51. Where the Reasonable Grounds decision is positive, but the Pilot Site
does not believe it can take a positive Conclusive Grounds decision at the
same time, for example, due to insufficient evidence, the Pilot Site will
schedule a second meeting to take the conclusive grounds decision within
45 calendar days of the initial meeting.</p>

<p>1.52. If a second meeting is required, Pilot Site decision makers should
consider what evidence will be necessary to enable them to take the
Conclusive Grounds decision at the second meeting and ensure every effort is made to obtain that evidence. Where the Pilot Site is aware that further relevant information will be available at a later date e.g. a medical
assessment or police report, the site should ensure that information is
obtained for the second meeting.</p>

<p>1.53. As the SCA does with cases involving an adult, if the child is subject to
criminal proceedings, the Pilot Site should consider the child’s case as a
matter of urgency and inform the SCA as soon as the decision is made,
who will inform all interested parties. However, a decision should still only
be made where there is sufficient information available to do so.</p>

<p>1.54. The Pilot Site may receive a request to delay making a Conclusive
Grounds decision; for example, until an interested party can submit further
information they deem relevant to a case. The Pilot Site should consider
the circumstances of the request, whether the additional information is
required for the decision, and as such whether it is appropriate to wait
rather than proceeding with a decision. The Pilot Site should discuss the
request with the SCA who must inform the victim, or an appropriate
representative, of the outcome of the request to delay and provide
reasons if the request is refused.</p>

<h4>Standard of proof for Reasonable Grounds decision</h4>

<p>1.55. When the Pilot Site receives a referral, they must decide whether on
the information available it is reasonable to believe that a person is a
victim of human trafficking or slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory
labour.</p>

<p>1.56. The test the Pilot Site must apply is whether the statement below is
true:</p>

<p>‘I suspect but cannot prove’ the person is a victim of modern slavery
(human trafficking or slavery, servitude, or forced or compulsory
labour)’</p>

<ul>
  <li>is true; or</li>
  <li>whether a reasonable person having regard to the information in the mind of the decision maker, would think there are Reasonable Grounds to believe the individual is a victim of modern slavery (human trafficking or slavery, servitude or forced or compulsory labour)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.57. It may not be initially clear to the Pilot Site whether a potential victim
has been subject to human trafficking or slavery, servitude, and forced or
compulsory labour. To reach a positive Reasonable Grounds decision the
Pilot Site just needs to determine that, on the information available, it is
reasonable to believe that a person is a victim of modern slavery; the Pilot Site does not need to distinguish at the Reasonable Grounds stage which form of modern slavery they have experienced.</p>

<p>1.58. Reasonable suspicion would not normally be met on the basis of an
unsubstantiated claim alone, without reliable, credible, precise and up to
date:</p>

<ul>
  <li>intelligence or information</li>
  <li>evidence of some specific behaviour by the person concerned</li>
</ul>

<p>1.59. The Reasonable Grounds decision has significant consequences for
the potential victim in terms of protection and support (and potential
further stay in the UK if they are subject to immigration control). It is
important that the decision is of the highest possible standard and takes
all available evidence into account when reaching the decision, including
the expert views of those surrounding the individual. The following
information should be considered where available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reference to the indicators of modern slavery in the referral</li>
  <li>intelligence or information from law enforcement agencies, including objective country of origin evidence</li>
  <li>information from First Responders, support organisations, social services and persons involved in assisting the victim</li>
  <li>evidence of some specific behaviour by the person concerned</li>
  <li>information available to local safeguarding partners involved in the decision-making process</li>
  <li>information provided by the Home Office, for example, in relation to an asylum claim</li>
  <li>any other relevant information available to the Pilot Site</li>
</ul>

<p>1.60. This is a non-exhaustive list and there may be additional information
that is relevant. Where reliable, credible, precise and up-to-date
intelligence, information or evidence is present and relevant, it must be
considered in reaching a Reasonable Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.61. If a person is a victim of modern slavery then they are a victim of a
crime. It is not necessary for a victim to cooperate with a criminal case in
order to obtain a Reasonable Grounds decision. The Pilot Sites can
explore information about the alleged offence in consultation with law
enforcement agencies, as part of the Reasonable Grounds assessment.
The absence of such information should not be taken as an indication that
someone is not a victim as there may be a range of reasons why
information cannot be obtained from law enforcement agencies, for
example, if exploitation occurred abroad.</p>

<p>1.62. It is not necessary to prove that an offence has taken place, or for there
to be an ongoing criminal investigation to find that an individual is a victim
of human trafficking and/or slavery, servitude, and forced or compulsory
labour.</p>

<p>1.63. Pilot Sites must remember that it is not possible for a child to give
informed consent to engage in criminal or other exploitative activity, and
they cannot give consent to be abused or trafficked, and so decision
makers do not need to consider the means used for the exploitation when
considering whether a case meets the definition of human trafficking.
When considering cases, Pilot Sites should bear in mind the child’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added vulnerability</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>possible grooming by the perpetrator</li>
</ul>

<p>1.64. Pilot Sites should ensure the relevant individuals from Children’s Social
Services are aware of the case and have had the opportunity to contribute
information if not involved directly in the decision-making process.</p>

<h4>Standard of proof for Conclusive Grounds decision</h4>

<p>1.65. At the Conclusive Grounds decision stage, the SCA must consider
whether, ‘on the balance of probabilities’, there is sufficient information to
decide if the individual is a victim of modern slavery.</p>

<p>1.66. The ‘balance of probabilities’ essentially means that, based on the
evidence available, modern slavery is more likely than not to have
happened. This standard of proof does not require the Pilot Site to be
certain that the event occurred.</p>

<p>1.67. In reaching their decision the pilot sight must weigh the balance of
probabilities by considering the whole modern slavery process and the
different and interrelated actions that need to have taken place. To make
their decision, they must weigh the strength of the evidence presented,
including the credibility of the claim, and use common sense and logic
based on the particular circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>1.68. There may be insufficient information in the NRM Referral Form and
the information available to decision makers for a Pilot Site to make a
Conclusive Grounds decision at the same time as a Reasonable Grounds
decision.</p>

<p>1.69. If the Pilot Site cannot make a Conclusive Grounds decision within 45
days on the evidence available, they should schedule a second meeting
no later than 45 days after the meeting at which the Reasonable Grounds
decision was made and consider what evidence will be needed to take the
Conclusive Grounds decision. This may include requesting further
information from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the First Responder Organisation</li>
  <li>ICTG (where appointed), Northern Ireland Independent Guardian Service, or Scottish Guardianship Service</li>
  <li>any other organisation known to have relevant information</li>
</ul>

<p>1.70. The Pilot Site may also seek information from other support providers
or other persons involved in assisting the victim where appropriate. In
cases where it is likely that the person will be issued a negative
Conclusive Grounds decision, the Pilot Site should ensure all relevant
questions have been asked.</p>

<p>1.71. Some of the indicators on the referral form may not be apparent on the
initial encounter but may become clear later, for example during any
subsequent interviews with an interpreter and/or at a safe location (for
example in a police station). The Pilot Site should be mindful of any
ongoing process which may be able to provide additional information.</p>

<p>1.72. The Pilot Site must also take into account any expert reports submitted,
particularly those from qualified health practitioners. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Views-of-experts">Views of experts
during the NRM process</a>.</p>

<p>1.73. The Pilot Site should also take into account objective country of origin
information and other published information from a trusted source relating
to known or emerging patterns of modern slavery.</p>

<p>1.74. If the Pilot Site has sufficient evidence to make a positive Conclusive
Grounds decision at the same time it makes a positive Reasonable
Grounds decision it should do so immediately. The child will continue to
receive a 45-calendar day Recovery Period (90 days in Scotland) from the
date of the Reasonable Grounds decision. See the Modern Slavery Act
2015 Statutory Guidance for more information on the Recovery Period.</p>

<p>1.75. Pilot Sites must remember that it is not possible for a child to give
informed consent to engage in criminal or other exploitative activity, and
they cannot give consent to be abused or trafficked, so decision makers
do not need to consider the means used for the exploitation when
considering whether a case meets the definition of human trafficking.</p>

<p>1.76. Pilot Sites must also keep in mind the child’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added vulnerability</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>possible grooming by the perpetrator</li>
</ul>

<p>1.77. Pilot Sites should ensure the relevant individuals from Children’s Social
Services are aware of the case and have had the opportunity to contribute
information if not involved directly in the decision-making process</p>

<h4>Recording a decision</h4>

<p>1.78. As part of the decision-making process, Pilot Sites will complete the
recording template and return this, with any evidence relied upon to reach
the decision, to the SCA. This should be done for both Reasonable
Grounds and Conclusive Grounds decisions. Where both decisions are taken in the same meeting, only one template is required. Where appropriate, the Pilot Site should specify where information is not
disclosable in a Subject Access Request.</p>

<p>1.79. The SCA will record the outcome of the decision on appropriate Home
Office databases and issue any required decision letters or other

<h4>Multi-Agency Assurance Panels (MAAPs)</h4>

<p>1.80. The MAAPs process will continue to apply to negative Conclusive
Grounds decisions made by Pilot Sites. This is fully detailed in the original
Annex E of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 statutory guidance.</p>

<h3>Actions for the Single Competent Authority following a National Referral Mechanism decision (Reasonable and/or Conclusive Grounds)</h3>

<p>1.81. During the Pilot Programme, the SCA will continue to issue decisions
once all appropriate processes have been competed; e.g. MAAPs have
reviewed a negative Conclusive Grounds decision.</p>

<p>1.82. This section sets out the actions the SCA will need to take following a
Reasonable Grounds and/or Conclusive Grounds decision. In all NRM
cases, when a decision is made the SCA must take the following actions:</p>

<h4>Action 1: Record the decision</h4>

<p>1.83. The SCA must update the SCA records when any of the following
occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>positive Reasonable Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>negative Reasonable Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>positive Reasonable and Conclusive Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>positive Conclusive Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>negative Conclusive Grounds decision made</li>
  <li>a MAAP panel has reviewed a Negative Conclusive Grounds decision</li>
  <li>a reconsideration is requested</li>
  <li>a decision is suspended or withdrawn</li>
</ul>

<p>1.84. In all cases the SCA will record the outcome of the Pilot Sites decisions
and the evidence relied upon using the reporting template.</p>

<h4>Action 2: Notify relevant agencies of the decision</h4>

<p>1.85. The SCA should complete the appropriate decision letter for the case outcome.</p>

<p>1.86. For a negative decision, the SCA must include a copy of the
consideration minute providing full details of what they have considered
and explaining the decision.</p>

<p>1.87. The letter should be issued to the relevant support worker in the Local
Authority, and ICTG where available, Northern Ireland Independent
Guardian Service, or Scottish Guardianship Service.</p>

<p>1.88. The SCA must not serve a decision letter or other modern slavery
papers on a child under any circumstances. All modern slavery papers
must be served on the child’s appointed representative or the Local
Authority and ICTG where available, Northern Ireland Independent
Guardian Service, or Scottish Guardianship Service.</p>

<p>1.89. The SCA must notify the following of their decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the First Responder and/or First Responder Organisation (in all cases)</li>
  <li>the Local Authority in England, Scotland and Wales</li>
  <li>the ICTG (where appointed), Northern Ireland Independent Guardian Service, or Scottish Guardianship Service</li>
</ul>

<p>1.90. The SCA should update Home Office databases as appropriate (for example,
NRM referral case type, special condition, removal barrier), noting that the minimum 45 day recovery period must be observed.</p>

<p>1.91. The SCA should update police following a Reasonable Grounds
decision or Conclusive Grounds decision. For more information see
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988810/May_2021_-_Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.2.pdf" rel="external">Information sharing between the SCA and the police</a>.</p>

<h4>Action 3: Notify law enforcement (where criminal proceedings are involved)</h4>

<p>1.92. If the individual is the subject of criminal proceedings the SCA must
contact the police as soon as the NRM decision is made.</p>

<p>1.93. The SCA must ensure that the police (or the Police Scotland’s National
Human Trafficking Unit) are notified of the NRM decision as soon as they
make it. This is done by sending the police a copy of the notification letter
or contacting them by email or telephone as appropriate.</p>

<p>1.94. Generally, the SCA must ask the police to notify any relevant
prosecutors (the Crown Prosecution Service, the Crown Office and
Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland, or Prosecution Service in Northern
Ireland) of the NRM decision as soon as the decision is ready to be
served.</p>

<p>1.95. For more information see the section 45 defence <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988810/May_2021_-_Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.2.pdf" rel="external">(Annex H)</a>.</p>

<h3>Actions for the Single Competent Authority when a National Referral Mechanism decision is suspended</h3>

<p>1.96. Actions for the SCA in a suspended case will continue as set out in the
original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>1.97. The SCA and Pilot Site will agree an appropriate course of action on a
case-by-case basis if they believe a case may need to be suspended. If
any of the following occur, a Pilot Site must notify the SCA as soon as
reasonably possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the child dies, goes missing, or is arrested</li>
  <li>there is a change in the local authority responsible for the child</li>
  <li>there is a criminal trial date set ahead of the expected decision date</li>
</ul>

<p>1.98. Pilot Sites must notify the SCA if they become aware of any other
reason why a decision may need to be suspended.</p>

<h3>Actions for the Single Competent Authority in live immigration cases following a National Referral Mechanism decision</h3>

<p>1.99. Actions for the SCA in relation to immigration cases will continue as set
out in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Modern Slavery Act 2015 Statutory
Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Single Competent Authority case record</h3>

<p>1.100. An SCA case record must be kept by SCA staff.</p>

<p>1.101. When modern slavery cases are concluded, all SCA case records
must, at a minimum, contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Responder referral form</li>
  <li>Decision letter(s)</li>
  <li>Pilot Site Decision Record from Pilot Sites and accompanying evidence
    <ul>
      <li>[where Conclusive Grounds decision is negative] record of the MAAP decision where relevant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>details of referrals to other relevant organisations, e.g. police / ICTG</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclosure of information to the victim and right of access requests</h3>

<p>1.102. Pilot Sites will be data processors for the purpose of NRM data. As
such, if a right of access request is raised with a Pilot Site, the SCA as
data controller should be notified.</p>

<p>1.103. The outcome of Reasonable Grounds and Conclusive Grounds
decisions will always be disclosed to victims (or an appropriate
representative as most appropriate for the child) as a matter of course.</p>

<p>1.104. Victims can request access to the information held about them by the
SCA, as data controller, in accordance with Article 15 of the GDPR.
Requests for information should be submitted in writing. Templates to
assist with requesting this information are available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/" rel="external">Information
Commissioner’s Office</a>.</p>

<p>1.105. Section 15 of the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2015 allows for exemptions
from right of access requests as set out in Schedule 2 of the DPA 2015.
These exemptions include for 2(1)(a) the prevention of a crime, and
2(1)(b) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. As such, where
there is sensitive information in the referral form or decision minute, this
should be redacted before the records are released. Examples of
sensitive information that may not be released, include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information about police or other law enforcement investigations</li>
  <li>Information regarding other victims</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tribunal Requests</h4>

<p>1.106. Actions for the SCA in relation to Tribunal Requests cases will continue
as set out in the original Annex E of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/modern-slavery-how-to-identify-and-support-victims">Modern Slavery Act 2015
Statutory Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Reconsideration of Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision</h3>

<p>1.107. An individual, or someone acting on their behalf, may request
reconsideration of a negative Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive
Grounds decision if additional evidence becomes available that would be
material to the outcome of a case, or there are specific concerns that a
decision made is not in line with guidance.</p>

<p>1.108. If the Pilot Site receives a request for a reconsideration, the SCA
should be informed as soon as reasonably possible. The SCA will inform
the relevant Pilot Site if the SCA receives a request for a reconsideration
relating to a decision a Pilot Site has made.</p>

<p>1.109. The SCA and Pilot Site will discuss the merits of the reconsideration
request, but the SCA will have the final decision as to whether the case
should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>1.110. If the SCA determines a case should be reconsidered, the SCA will
determine whether the Pilot Site or the SCA is best placed to reconsider
the decision.</p>

<p>1.111. Full details on reconsideration request are set out in the original Annex E.</p>

<h3>Improper claims and public order</h3>

<p>1.112. The Recovery Period will not be observed if either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grounds of public order prevent it</li>
  <li>it is found that victim status was claimed improperly</li>
</ul>

<p>1.113. If a Pilot Site believes a claim has been made improperly or that there
a public order concerns regarding a victim, the Pilot Site should notify the
SCA of any concerns.</p>

<p>1.114. Where the SCA determines that there is firm, objective evidence that
an improper claim has been made, as soon as this becomes known, the
SCA must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>issue a negative Conclusive Grounds decision</li>
  <li>curtail any remaining Recovery Period and notify the appropriate immigration unit for them to consider taking action as appropriate (if the person has any outstanding leave due to another immigration application this may continue to run unless found to have been claimed improperly also)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.115. If the evidence of an improper claim is not firm and objective as
determined by the SCA, the Pilot Site must follow standard processes and
observe the full Recovery Period.</p>

<p>1.116. It is also possible that an individual who initially claimed to be a victim
of modern slavery could be involved in the modern slavery of others.
These cases must immediately be referred to the police or the Home
Office criminal investigation team of Immigration Enforcement for
appropriate action.</p>

<h3>Revocation of Conclusive Grounds decision</h3>

<p>1.117. Where the SCA or a Pilot Site has made a positive Conclusive
Grounds decision, but information later comes to light which suggests that
the decision was flawed, the SCA should consider whether revocation is
appropriate.</p>

<p>1.118. Where the decision has been made by a Pilot Site, the SCA will
discuss their concerns with the Pilot Site who made the decision to
determine whether a revocation is appropriate. It will be for the SCA to
make the final determination, but this will not happen before concerns
have been discussed with the Pilot Site.</p>

<p>1.119. If it is determined that it is appropriate to revoke the Conclusive
Grounds decision, the SCA caseworker must write to the individual
concerned, or an appropriate representative. If it is not possible to make
contact directly with the individual concerned in an appropriate way, the
SCA should contact their legal representative (where known) and/or their
most recent support provider under the Victim Care Contract (where
engaged), or equivalent support providers in Northern Ireland and
Scotland, to seek to regain contact.</p>

<p>1.120. If the individual has been issued a period of Discretionary Leave, the
SCA must notify the appropriate immigration team for them to consider
whether curtailment of this leave is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Withdrawing from the National Referral Mechanism</h3>

<p>1.121. An adult may decide they want to leave the NRM before they receive a
Reasonable Grounds or Conclusive Grounds decision. Sometimes those
adults are leaving the UK via a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974794/March_2021_-_Modern_Slavery_Statutory_Guidance__EW__Non-Statutory_Guidance__SNI__v2.1_.pdf" rel="external">voluntary return</a>, or sometimes adults
choose to withdraw consent for other reasons.</p>

<p>1.122. If an adult leaves the UK prior to receiving a Reasonable Grounds
decision from the NRM the SCA may treat this as a withdrawn case. The
SCA should notify the following organisations that the individual has
withdrawn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Responder</li>
  <li>the VCC support provider (where the victim is in VCC support) or equivalent support providers in Northern Ireland and Scotland</li>
  <li>investigating police force where relevant (or Police Scotland’s National Human Trafficking Unit)</li>
  <li>Adult Safeguarding Services (where engaged in the case of adults)</li>
</ul>

<p>1.123. If an adult wishes to withdraw from the NRM after they receive a
positive Reasonable Grounds decision (or if they are in the UK and wish
to withdraw prior to receiving this decision) they should write to the SCA
expressing their wish to withdraw or use a consent to withdraw from the
NRM template form.</p>

<p>1.124. The SCA should notify the organisations listed above of the decision to
withdraw. A person who withdraws from the NRM will not receive any
further decisions or support from the NRM and their case will be regarded
as concluded. This does not prevent a person being re-referred to the
NRM in the future.</p>

<p>1.125. Children may not withdraw themselves from the NRM. A child may not
be withdrawn from the NRM unless it is in the best interests of the child as
determined by the responsible Local Authority Child Safeguarding
Services. If the SCA receives a request from a Local Authority or
embassy, for example, seeking that a child be withdrawn from the NRM,
the case should be referred to the Modern Slavery Unit for advice.</p>

<p>1.126. Sometimes an adult has not withdrawn from the NRM and has not
notified the SCA that they have left the UK but the SCA has strong
evidence that an adult has left the UK and there is no evidence they plan
to return at this time. They may for example be notified by a support
provider that the adult has left the UK with no evidence they plan to
return.</p>

<p>1.127. In this situation the SCA should proceed to take any outstanding NRM
decisions in the case unless there is insufficient evidence to do so. Even
though the victim may no longer be seeking support from the NRM, taking
a decision will allow statistics to be captured on the extent of modern
slavery in the UK and may assist in ongoing criminal prosecutions as well
as civil claims that might be brought by the victim in the future. If the victim
cannot be notified of their decision as they are no longer in the UK, the
SCA should notify the organisations listed above and any other relevant
parties where appropriate.</p>
