<p>We are not currently recruiting new Ambassadors. We will update this page again when we have vacant roles.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Ministerial foreword</h2>

<p>Thank you very much for your interest in a Disability and Access Ambassador role.</p>

<p>The ambassadors use their influential status as business leaders, to drive improvements to the accessibility and quality of services and facilities in their sector for disabled people, as consumers and employees.</p>

<p>They also work together as a group to galvanise and encourage accessibility generally across the private sector, and work on projects of joint benefit.</p>

<p>There are currently 19 ambassadors covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advertising</li>
  <li>airports</li>
  <li>arts and culture</li>
  <li>banking</li>
  <li>brand and design in the built environment</li>
  <li>buses</li>
  <li>countryside and heritage</li>
  <li>creative industries</li>
  <li>energy</li>
  <li>hospitality (restaurants and pubs)</li>
  <li>housing (private)</li>
  <li>insurance</li>
  <li>rail</li>
  <li>recruitment</li>
  <li>retail (shops)</li>
  <li>sports and physical activity</li>
  <li>technology and web accessibility</li>
  <li>tourism</li>
  <li>universities</li>
</ul>

<p>Previous and current ambassadors have become a catalyst for change. Their activities have led to, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved airport travel experiences for disabled people</li>
  <li>significant improvements in rail and bus access</li>
  <li>greater awareness of the needs of disabled shoppers, and the production of support guides for retailers in how to provide accessible shopping experiences</li>
  <li>improved access to the countryside and heritage sites</li>
  <li>awards for hoteliers in the provision of disabled facilities</li>
  <li>significant signposting in the insurance industry to products and services for customers with disabilities</li>
  <li>access cards to enable greater participation in the arts</li>
</ul>

<p>I am now looking for 2 further ambassadors who are ambitious, passionate and dynamic, with strong networks in their sector and the ability to reach out to a wide range of organisations to create momentum for change. These ambassadors will cover heritage and retail. They will replace 2 ambassadors who are coming to the end of their 3-year tenures or who have retired due to changing sectors. More details of these roles are below. If you are ready for this challenge, I encourage you to apply.</p>

<p>I look forward to welcoming our new ambassadors.</p>

<p>Chloe Smith MP<br>
Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background information</h2>

<p>The Disability and Access Ambassadors represent a range of different sectors and businesses. They use their influential status as leaders in their sectors to drive improvements to the accessibility and quality of services and facilities in their sector, and to encourage equal employment opportunities for disabled people.</p>

<p>Many businesses already recognise the needs and the business potential of disabled consumers, however, disabled people still find many venues and businesses inaccessible.</p>

<p>There are more than 14 million disabled people in the UK. The annual spending power of their households, the âpurple poundâ, is Â£249 billion (Purple, 2017). The Disability and Access Ambassadors help to promote the business case for making products and services available to a group of consumers who are often overlooked. They showcase good practice in their sectors and, in doing so, show other businesses the moral and economic merit of meeting the needs of disabled customers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background to the Disability Unit</h2>

<p>The Disability Unit in the Cabinet Office is a cross-government team working across different government departments and with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Disability Unit works with the Disability and Access Ambassadors on behalf of the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, and is overseeing this recruitment exercise.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Disability and Access Ambassadors role</h2>

<p>The Disability and Access Ambassadors tackle the issues that disabled people face as consumers and employees. They use business-to-business engagement to share good practice, and highlight specific changes and improvements their sectors can make that will make a difference to millions of disabled people. They also work together to support more systemic change in the private sector.</p>

<p>The Disability and Access Ambassador is a voluntary, unpaid role, which the individual undertakes alongside their day job.</p>

<p>As a Disability and Access Ambassador, it is expected that you will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a self-motivated, successful business person, with strong networks</li>
  <li>credible and respected by your sector, and able to reach out to a wide range of businesses</li>
  <li>passionate about driving social change for disabled people</li>
</ul>

<p>To take forward this role, it is expected that you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a public advocate for improving accessibility and quality of services or facilities in your sector</li>
  <li>showcase best practice in accessibility</li>
  <li>work constructively and objectively with civil servants and ministers to drive improvements within your sector</li>
  <li>highlight the business benefits of making services accessible to disabled people</li>
  <li>ensure that businesses in your sector understand the benefits of employing disabled people</li>
  <li>share progress with the Minister for Disabled People, your sector, and the interested public, including using social media where appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p>Successful candidates will be asked to provide a statement outlining their plans, aims and objectives in the role. Quarterly, and at the end of each year, Disability and Access Ambassadors will be asked to provide a report detailing their actions, and outcomes achieved.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>You will be required to treat in confidence the information received whilst undertaking this appointment, and will be subject to the Official Secrets Act 1989. Further information will be provided to the successful candidates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Duration of appointment</h2>

<p>The appointment will be made by the Minister for Disabled People. It will be for 1 year initially, and can be renewed twice to give a total period of 3 years.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Equality of opportunity</h2>

<p>The Disability Unit is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all staff, including voluntary appointments. We will not discriminate on grounds of gender, gender identity, race, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief, age, those with caring responsibilities, part time workers or any other factor irrelevant to a personâs work.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Description of new role remits</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Heritage</h3>

<p>This ambassador will work across the heritage sector to encourage and support improvement of access and opportunity for disabled people in heritage buildings.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Retail</h3>

<p>This ambassador will engage across all parts of the retail sector to encourage greater access and support for disabled people in the retail environment, on the high street and in the land usage and signage of retail commercial space.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>The recruitment process</h2>

<p>A selection panel will sift candidates for appointment based on the criteria in the application pack. If 2 or more candidates have equally met all the criteria for a particular role, they will be invited to an interview. Should interviews be required they will be held remotely.</p>

<p>The panel will submit its recommendations for appointment to the Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work who will decide on, and make, the appointments. The minister may also wish to meet all candidates recommended by the selection panel.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Standards of conduct and conflicts of interest</h2>

<p>The successful candidates will be required to agree their commitment to the Seven Principles of Public Life, as drawn up by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, more commonly known as the Nolan Principles. These can be found at Annex 1.</p>

<p>Public bodies are expected to maintain a register of membersâ interests to avoid any danger of board members being influenced or appearing to be influenced by their private interests in the exercise of their public duties. Candidates will be asked to disclose any real or perceived conflicts of interest. These do not constitute an automatic bar to appointment, but they must be manageable. Conflicts could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial arrangements â for example, fees or shareholdings of the candidate, business associates or close family</li>
  <li>membership of organisations whose aims might be perceived to be in conflict with those of the government</li>
  <li>any activity which, if revealed after appointment, could cause embarrassment to the government</li>
</ul>

<p>While undertaking the role you must not lobby the government on either your own behalf or on behalf of your parent company, or be seen to be doing so.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Data Protection</h2>

<p>We take our obligations under the Data Protection Act seriously. Any information about you will be held in secure conditions with access restricted to those who need it in connection with dealing with your application and the selection process.</p>

<p>Data may also be used for the purposes of monitoring the effectiveness of the recruitment process, but in these circumstances, all data will be kept anonymous.</p>

<p>If you are unsuccessful, your personal data relating to your application will be destroyed after 12 months.</p>

<p>For further information about how your personal data will be handled, please see the attached Privacy Notice (Annex 2).</p>
