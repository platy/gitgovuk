<p>The Cabinet Office’s Disability Unit is seeking 2 new Disability and Access Ambassadors to replace ambassadors who have come to the end of their tenure or who have retired due to changing sectors.</p>

<p>There are currently 19 ambassadors who use their influential status as leaders in their sectors to drive improvements to the accessibility and quality of services and facilities in their sector. Previous and current ambassadors have all made great progress and some very significant changes in their sectors, but there is much more to do to ensure that disabled people are fully included across the whole of society.</p>

<p>We are issuing a call for senior business people to become Disability and Access Ambassadors in their sectors. They will represent, and be champions for, access and disability inclusion, initially for 1 year (with possibility of extension to 3 years), in each of the following sectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heritage</li>
  <li>retail</li>
</ul>

<p>We need ambassadors who are ambitious, passionate and dynamic, with strong networks and the ability to reach out to a wide range of organisations and to create momentum for change.</p>

<p>Ambassadors undertake this voluntary role alongside their day job, and are not paid to undertake it.</p>

<p>If you would like to submit an expression of interest, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-to-be-a-disability-and-access-ambassador/how-to-apply">how to apply</a>. The closing date is 11:59pm on Sunday 10 July 2022.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:disability-and-access-ambassadors@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">disability-and-access-ambassadors@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
