<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political and economic</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Political overview</h3>

<p>The Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, established a complex and highly devolved governance structure, which affects efficiency at all levels. The state has few competences whilst the 2 entities - the Bosniak and Croat-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serb-dominated Republika Srpska - enjoy substantial autonomy.</p>

<p>The Federation is further divided into 10 cantons. Additionally there is the tiny Brcko District, a unit of local self-governance. Many of the challenges common to other Western Balkans’ countries, such as underdeveloped institutions, low capacity of the civil service, and a weak judiciary are multi-layered in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This means that doing business in Bosnia and Herzegovina is more difficult than in many other countries in the region, even if local businesses have learnt over the years how to overcome various barriers.</p>

<p>Despite general elections in October 2018, the Federation and government had still not formed. The previously appointed governments continue in technical mandates which hampers socioeconomic reform efforts. The next general elections are due in October 2022. Recent political moves by the parliament of the Republika Srpska to withdraw competences from key state institutions are undermining stability in the country and raising political tensions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Economic overview</h3>

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina is a relatively small, open transitional economy with strong import needs. In 2021, the country’s estimated nominal GDP was EUR 18.16 billion, with a projected real annual GDP growth of around 5.7%.</p>

<p>Pre-pandemic, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy was growing, but at a pace below the more successful countries in Eastern Europe, mostly as a consequence of a political deadlock, lack of political will, patronage networks, institutional weaknesses, poor infrastructure and low level of investment. The pandemic generated substantial output contractions in 2020, but the economy experienced strong signs of recovery in 2021. Inflation was higher than expected in 2021, driven by the increase in food prices and in energy prices in Europe. High inflation pressures are expected to remain one of the main economic challenges in 2022.</p>

<p>Real unemployment continues to be high at approximately 16%, posing a constraint on consumption. Average net monthly salary is €514.00. Government spending is large, at approximately 47% of GDP, but ineffective.</p>

<p>After the protests and floods of 2014, we saw a stronger EU focus on socio-economic reforms in BiH.  Since then, BiH has undertaken reforms in the area of labour legislation, pensions, tax and the business climate to attract more foreign direct investment to the country.</p>

<p>The current EU focus on BiH is set out in the 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/20190529-bosnia-and-herzegovina-opinion.pdf" rel="external">European Commission Opinion</a> on candidacy status, prioritising democracy, functionality, the rule of law, human rights and public administrative reform. Socio-economic reforms were conditions for a potential Extended Fund Facility Arrangement with the IMF in 2021. However, due to the lack of the political will to undertake reforms in the area of energy, digitalisation and transparency, the negotiations with the IMF failed and a new arrangement was not agreed.</p>

<p>On 1 June 2015, the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina entered into force. The SAA establishes a closer partnership between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina; deepens the political, economic and trade ties necessary to increase the confidence of international and domestic investors.</p>

<p>It is the main framework for relations between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2020 the EU accounted for 60% of imports and 72% of exports. But to meet its legal obligations under the SAA, Bosnia and Herzegovina still needs to develop a national programme for the adoption of the EU acquis, as set out in the European Commission’s Opinion.</p>

<p>On 1 January 2021, trading terms between the UK and BIH have changed and new customs tariffs were introduced in both countries. For more information on the implications of the BiH Customs Policy please visit Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations.</p>

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important partner to the UK, and we are working hard with BiH counterparts to sign a trade cooperation agreement to reproduce effects of the SAA. The BiH Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently coordinating the process and official negotiations are expected to start in 2022.</p>

<p>Recovering GDP growth in the Eurozone is expected to have a positive impact on the country’s industrial production. Export growth is observed across all traditional industries: electric power, steel, aluminium, furniture, as well as primary agricultural products. Although investors are guaranteed free transfer of capital as well as repatriation of profit, foreign direct investment remains modest and is hindered by excessive layers of bureaucracy and corruption.</p>

<p>According to Central Bank data, most investments between 1994 and 2021 came from Austria, Serbia, Croatia and Germany. In February 2022, Standard &amp; Poor’s affirmed its sovereign credit rating of “B” with a stable outlook. The economy is underpinned by a convertible currency with fixed parity to the Euro. As a result, the convertible mark is one of the most stable currencies in Southeast Europe. The banking sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina remains reasonably liquid and well capitalised. Foreign banks account for over 90% of total assets in the financial system, but the banking sector has not been subject to large credit outflows to parent banks.</p>

<p>The IMF allocated around EUR 300 million to BiH on the basis of its general allocation of SDRs in 2021. In addition to this, the European Commission transferred EUR 124 million-worth first tranche of macro-financial assistance funds (EUR 250 million), on the basis of the signed Agreement on Credit Line between the EU and BiH.</p>

<p>The government can provide finance or credit insurance specifically to support UK exports through UK Export Finance – the UK’s export credit agency. As part of the Government’s ambition to boost trade, in November 2020 UKEF increased its country limit for BIH from £250 million to 2 billion. For up-to-date country specific information on the support available see UK Export Finance’s country cover policy and indicators.</p>

<p>The frequent political stalemates and the resulting low predictability for investors have a negative bearing on the business environment. This is further hampered by poor rule of law, substantial red tape, corruption and lengthy and complex administrative procedures, partly as a result of the high degree of fragmentation of the country’s internal market.</p>

<p>As a result of a poor business environment, of a widespread corruption and of weaknesses in the country’s education system, structural unemployment is worryingly high, in particular among young people (34%) and vulnerable groups.</p>

<p>The overall situation and the lack of perspective has led to high levels of emigration, which, combined with a rapidly aging population and a declining birth rate, pose significant threats to country’s ability to grow. A 2018 World Economic Forum report found only Haiti and Venezuela had higher rates of lost talent. A 2021 UNFPA survey showed that 47% of young people are looking to leave the country.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Human rights</h2>

<p>A legal and institutional framework for the observance of human rights is in place and the main elements of international human rights laws have been incorporated into the legal system. With regard to labour and trade union rights, the law provides for the right of workers in both entities to form and join independent unions. In both entities and Brcko District, the law provides for the right to strike. In 2016, labour laws were adopted in both the Federation and Republika Srpska, with the aim of introducing “Flexi-Security” into the system.</p>

<p>Fragmentation of the legal framework across the country remains an issue, notably regarding economic and social rights.</p>

<p>Violations of worker rights continue to be a lower priority for labour inspectors, who focus instead on unregistered employees and employers not paying taxes. While no legal or technical barriers prevent an employee from bringing a complaint against an employer, high unemployment coupled with fear of losing one’s job, backlogs in the court system, and the lack of legal protection for the large section of the labour force working in the informal economy remain disincentives to filing complaints.</p>

<p>People with disabilities face particular problems. There is a law banning discrimination, in which disability would be covered but implementation is weak and there is no specific state law regarding disability. Legislation does not ensure this category of the equal opportunity to work. Individuals with disabilities, particularly those with more severe impairments, are not generally in a position to find employment on the open labour market. There are few companies focusing on the employment of people with disabilities and those that do are active only in major urban centres.</p>

<p>Legal provisions guaranteeing women’s rights and gender equality are in place. Although few women hold positions of substantial economic or political power, they are represented in most professions. However, surveys have shown that women have no larger share in employment than men in any formal economic sector.
There are improvements in legislation related to protection of equal opportunities for LGBT people but conservative values are prevalent and Pride marches proved impossible before 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world. In addition, a commercial organization carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national nor resident in the UK nor a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 2010 <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents" rel="external">Bribery Act</a>,became law on 1 July 2011, signalling a concerted effort by the UK to be among the leading nations in international anti-corruption efforts. The Ministry of Justice published Guidance for business on 30 March 2011, to help companies to familiarise themselves with the Act before it becomes law.</p>

<p>The Commission Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for membership of the European Union indicates that the fight against corruption and organised crime is hampered by a lack of harmonisation of legislation across the country and by weak institutional cooperation and coordination. Corruption is widespread and all levels of government show signs of political capture directly affecting the daily lives of citizens, notably in health, education, employment and public procurement matters.</p>

<p>The policy, institutional and legal framework to prevent corruption is fragmented and has significant gaps. Law-enforcement agencies are fragmented and vulnerable to undue political interference. Prosecutors are not sufficiently proactive. Financial investigations and asset seizures are largely ineffective. The fight against money laundering needs to be stepped up.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview" rel="external">Transparency International</a> operates a branch office in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perception Index, ranked Bosnia and Herzegovina joint 110th out of 180 (along with Albania, Mongolia, Malawi and Thailand), down from 89th in 2018. Its score of 35 is 7 lower than 2013.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Terrorism threat</h2>

<p>Terrorist attacks can not be ruled out in BiH.  Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Intellectual property</h2>

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to make progress, particularly in the area of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights. Further efforts are required to improve enforcement and coordination. In general, there is a low level of awareness of copyright issues in the country’s private sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Organised crime</h2>

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina faces challenges from organised crime including drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illegal migration, illegal firearms and counterfeiting. Bosnia and Herzegovina is both a transit route and a destination for organised crime activity.</p>

<p>The 2021 EU Report on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application notes that in January 2020, Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted a 2020-2023 strategy to counter trafficking in human beings, while  2021-2024 strategy for fighting against organised crime has not yet been adopted.  However, it notes shortcomings in operational cooperation between law enforcement agencies, limited exchange of intelligence, police vulnerability to political interference and ineffective use of financial investigations and asset seizures. All these are exploited by criminal organisations.</p>

<p>The 2021 report notes a decrease of numbers compared to 2019. In 2020 there were 52 investigations into organised crime with 359 suspects, 22 indictments with 103 accused, 7 convictions with 54 convicted, and 23 acquittal (cf 91 convictions in 2019). A European Commission review in 2021 found no progress was made in addressing the Opinion priorities on the fight against organised crime. In 4 cases, plea bargain agreements were concluded with 27 individuals.  In February 2018, Bosnia and Herzegovina was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list of high-risk third countries with deficiencies in anti-money-laundering/counter terrorism financing, and from the EU list of high-risk countries in May 2020.</p>
