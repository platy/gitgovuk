<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This note provides country of origin information (<abbr title="Country of origin information">COI</abbr>) and analysis of <abbr title="Country of origin information">COI</abbr> for use by Home Office decision makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims (as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> section). It is not intended to be an exhaustive survey of a particular subject or theme.</p>

<p>It is split into 2 parts: (1) an assessment of <abbr title="Country of origin information">COI</abbr> and other evidence; and (2) <abbr title="Country of origin information">COI</abbr>. These are explained in more detail below.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>This section analyses the evidence relevant to this note - that is information in the <abbr title="Country of origin information">COI</abbr> section; refugee/human rights laws and policies; and applicable caselaw - by describing this and its inter-relationships, and provides an assessment of, in general, whether one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably likely to face a real risk of persecution or serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the general humanitarian situation is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to inhuman or degrading treatment as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules</a>/Article 3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts&amp;c=" rel="external">European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the security situation is such that there are substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of serious harm because there exists a serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a situation of international or internal armed conflict as within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iv) of the Immigration Rules</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is able to obtain protection from the state (or quasi state bodies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person is reasonably able to relocate within a country or territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a claim is likely to justify granting asylum, humanitarian protection or other form of leave</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if a claim is refused, it is likely or unlikely to be certifiable as ‘clearly unfounded’ under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" rel="external">section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Decision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case’s specific facts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Basis of claim</h3>

<p>1.1.1 That the general humanitarian situation in Iraq is so severe that there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk of serious harm because conditions amount to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment as defined in paragraphs 339C and 339CA(iii) of the Immigration Rules/Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Consideration of issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Credibility</h3>

<p>2.1.1 For information on assessing credibility, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing credibility and refugee status</a>.</p>

<p>2.1.2 Decision makers must also check if there has been a previous application for a UK visa or another form of leave. Asylum applications matched to visas should be investigated prior to the asylum interview (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-matches-handling-asylum-claims-from-uk-visa-applicants-instruction">Asylum instruction on visa matches, Asylum claims from UK visa applicants</a>).</p>

<p>2.1.3 In cases where there are doubts surrounding a person’s claimed place of origin, decision makers should also consider the need to conduct language analysis testing (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/language-analysis-instruction">Asylum instruction on language analysis</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>  Exclusion</h3>

<p>2.2.1 Decision makers must consider whether there are serious reasons for considering whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses is applicable. Each case must be considered on its individual facts and merits.</p>

<p>2.2.2 If the person is excluded from the Refugee Convention, they will also be excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection (which has a wider range of exclusions than refugee status).</p>

<p>2.2.3 For guidance on exclusion and restricted leave, see the Asylum Instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-instruction-exclusion-article-1f-of-the-refugee-convention">Exclusion under Articles 1F and 33(2) of the Refugee Convention</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Humanitarian Protection</a> and the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricted-leave-asylum-casework-instruction">Restricted leave</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Convention reason(s)</h3>

<p>2.3.1 A severe humanitarian situation does not in itself give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugee Convention reason.</p>

<p>2.3.2 In the absence of a link to one of the 5 Refugee Convention grounds necessary to be recognised as a refugee, the question to address is whether the person will face a real risk of serious harm in order to qualify for humanitarian protection (<abbr title="Humanitarian protection">HP</abbr>).</p>

<p>2.3.3 However, before considering whether a person requires protection because of the general humanitarian and/or security situation, decision makers must consider if the person faces persecution for a Refugee Convention reason. Where the person qualifies for protection under the Refugee Convention, decision makers do not need to consider if there are substantial grounds for believing the person faces a real risk of serious harm meriting a grant of <abbr title="Humanitarian protection">HP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.3.4 For further guidance on the 5 Refugee Convention grounds see the asylum instruction, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing credibility and refugee status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Risk</h3>

<p>2.4.1 Humanitarian conditions are, in general, not likely to be so severe as to result in a breach of paragraphs 339C and 339CA (iii) of the Immigration Rules/Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (<abbr title="European Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr>). However, decision makers must consider each case on its merits. There may be cases where a combination of circumstances means that a person will face such as breach.</p>

<p>2.4.2 In the country guidance case of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2022/110.html" rel="external">SMO &amp; KSP (Civil status documentation; Article 15) Iraq CG [2022] UKUT 110 (IAC)</a>, heard on 4 to 5 October 2021 and promulgated on 16 March 2022, the Upper Tribunal held:</p>

<p>‘The living conditions in Iraq as a whole, including the Formerly Contested Areas, are unlikely to give rise to a breach of Article 3 <abbr title="European Convention on Human Rights">ECHR</abbr> or (therefore) to necessitate subsidiary protection under Article 15(b) QD. Where it is asserted that return to a particular part of Iraq would give rise to such a breach, however, it is to be recalled that the minimum level of severity required is relative, according to the personal circumstances of the individual concerned. Any such circumstances require individualised assessment in the context of the conditions of the area in question.’ (paragraph 6 of part A of the headnote. The headnote for Civil Status Identity Documentation is at paragraphs 11 – 22 of part C).</p>

<p>2.4.3 At the time of writing there are not very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence to depart from the findings of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2022/110.html" rel="external">SMO &amp; KSP (Civil status documentation; Article 15) Iraq CG [2022] UKUT 110 (IAC)</a>.</p>

<p>2.4.4 In assessing whether an individual case reaches this threshold, decision makers must consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where the person is from (as humanitarian conditions are more severe in some areas than others, and this may also impact on whether the person becomes an <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> on return, if they were not already prior to leaving the country)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person’s individual profile and circumstances, including, but not limited to, their age, gender, state of health and ethnicity and means to support themselves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>vulnerability to discrimination because of perceived or actual affiliation to extremist groups</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person has the ability to relocate to another area and access a support network</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2.4.5 For more information to assess individual cases see Humanitarian situation.</p>

<p>2.4.6 For guidance on humanitarian protection see the asylum instruction, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Granting humanitarian protection</a>. For further guidance on assessing risk, see the asylum instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing credibility and refugee status</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Protection</h3>

<p>2.5.1 The state is not able to provide protection against a breach of Article 3 because of the general humanitarian conditions should this occur in individual cases.</p>

<p>2.5.2 For further guidance on assessing risk, see the instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing credibility and refugee status</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/humanitarian-protection-instruction">Granting humanitarian protection</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Internal relocation</h3>

<p>2.6.1 Internal relocation may be possible for an individual depending on their circumstances and what civil documentation they possess. See the <abbr title="Country policy and information note">CPIN</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iraq-country-policy-and-information-notes">Iraq: Internal relocation, civil documentation and returns</a> for more information.</p>

<p>When considering the possibility of non-Kurds relocating to the IKR, the findings of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2022/110.html" rel="external">SMO &amp; KSP (Civil status documentation; Article 15) Iraq CG [2022] UKUT 110 (IAC)</a> state that “particular care must be taken in evaluating whether internal relocation to the IKR for a non-Kurd would be reasonable. Given the economic and humanitarian conditions in the IKR at present, an Arab with no viable support network in the IKR is likely to&nbsp;experience&nbsp;unduly harsh conditions upon relocation there.” (See para 35).</p>

<p>2.6.2 For further guidance on considering internal relocation and factors to be taken into account see the asylum instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/considering-asylum-claims-and-assessing-credibility-instruction">Assessing credibility and refugee status</a>.</p>

<h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Overview</h3>

<p>4.1.1 On 27 March 2022 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (<abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr>) published a report (the <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report) on the projected humanitarian situation in Iraq in 2022. The report entitled ‘2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview: Iraq’ stated:</p>

<p>‘In 2020, the Iraqi economy contracted by 15.7% due to <abbr title="Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries">OPEC</abbr> (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil cuts and COVID-19. Partially in response to this, the <abbr title="Government of Iraq">GOI</abbr> [government of Iraq] devalued the currency by 18.5% in December 2020, which had a significant impact on citizens. However, oil prices recovered in 2021 (from US$45 per barrel to above $79 per barrel by November 2021), leading to predictions of a $10 billion budget surplus for the year. Accordingly, the World Bank predicts that Iraq’s <abbr title="Gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> will grow by 2.6% in 2021, 7.3%  in 2022 and 6.3%  in 2023.</p>

<p>‘… Despite increasing oil revenues and the reversal of initial economic shocks caused by COVID-19, future stability and prosperity of the country and her people is not assured. Any reduction in the price of oil; failure to implement necessary fiscal reforms; election related instability; delays in widespread vaccination; and deterioration in security conditions amidst high regional geopolitical tensions would undermine the economic stability of the country.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.1.2 On 16 June 2022 the World Bank stated that:</p>

<p>‘Iraq’s economy is gradually emerging from the deep recession caused by the pandemic and the plunge in oil prices in 2020. After contracting by more than 11 percent in 2020, the economy grew by 2.8 percent in 2021 supported by the solid expansion of non-oil output, in particular services, as COVID-19 movement restrictions were eased. Oil <abbr title="Gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> also started growing in the second half of 2021 as <abbr title="Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries">OPEC</abbr>+ production cuts started to be phased out. Higher oil revenues pushed Iraq’s overall fiscal and external balances into a surplus in 2021, however, fiscal rigidities and high level of unaccounted arrears remain.</p>

<p>‘… [T]he turnaround in oil markets has improved Iraq’s economic outlook in the medium term. The economy is projected to grow in 2022-24 by 5.4 percent on average per year in 2022-24 as oil production increases in line with production capacity and higher investments finance by the oil windfall drives non-oil <abbr title="Gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> growth. In the absence of structural reforms, the limited absorptive capacity of the economy remains a binding constraint on Iraq’s growth potential and macroeconomic stability.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>  Employment</h3>

<p>4.2.1 With regards to employment, the <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated:</p>

<p>‘Loss of income and livelihoods, prompted by COVID-19 in 2020, increased vulnerabilities and aggravated the humanitarian needs of <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees. As of January 2021, the national unemployment rate was more than 10 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic 12.7%, and while some jobs have since been recovered, unemployment remains particularly high among <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees, with women and people previously employed in the informal sectors mostly affected…As a result, unemployment and debt levels among conflict-affected households are higher in 2021 compared to 2020…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.2.2 The same report stated:</p>

<p>‘The precarious socioeconomic situation compels many to resort to negative coping strategies, exposing both adults and children to grave protection risks. The situation disproportionately affects women and people living with disabilities who often find it harder to find employment and be self-sufficient due to institutional and cultural barriers; and children who get married or engage in work to support their families. On average, among conflict-affected communities, 1% of children are married and 6% work to contribute to the family’s income; however, these issues are known to be underreported.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.2.3 The same report observed that:</p>

<p>‘While some camp residents find seasonal work or find employment within or near the camps, many adults are unemployed and seeking work. In the camps, 28% of households have at least one adult member unemployed and seeking work, while 90% of households report taking on debt to afford health care, food, education and basic household expenditures. <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> in camps note increased competition, jobs being too far away and lack of qualifications as the main barriers to employment. In-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> households with members living with disabilities and female-headed households are two and three times more likely, respectively to face unemployment compared to the rest of the households…’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>4.2.4 With regards to employment opportunities for out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> households, the <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated:</p>

<p>‘Insufficient and inadequate food consumption is the result of limited or no income which is exacerbated by lack of livelihoods opportunities. Some 30% of out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> households have at least one family member who is unemployed and seeking work. Many adults cannot find employment due to increased competition which is an issue for 73% of out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> households; perceived lack of opportunities for women (inclusive of both the failure of the market to open certain jobs for women and the perceived social and cultural barriers) noted by 17% of the households; and lack of qualifications which is a barrier for 12% of the households.’</p>

<p>With regards to employment opportunities for returnees, the <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report observed that:</p>

<p>‘Some 25% of all households that have returned to their areas of origin have at least one family member above the age of 18 who is unemployed and seeking work, an increase from 18 per cent in 2020. Although returnees are more likely to rely on paid public sector jobs than <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>, reliance on informal commerce or daily labour has reportedly also increased among returnees since 2020… Returnees cannot find employment primarily because of increased competition for jobs.’</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Overview</h3>

<p>5.1.1 The <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated: ‘4 years after the end of large-scale military operations against <abbr title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">ISIL</abbr> (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), the humanitarian context in Iraq remains fragile, characterized by protracted internal displacement; eroded national social cohesion; extensive explosive ordnance contamination; and incomplete rehabilitation of housing, basic services and livelihoods opportunities’.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.2 In a country brief published in May 2022, the World Food Programme summarized that ‘in Iraq, intermittent conflict and impact of climate change continue to affect the lives of people of Iraq. In the post-conflict context, there are approximately 1.2 million internally displaced persons (<abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>) and 4.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Insecurity, lack of livelihoods, and destroyed or damaged housing hamper people’s ability to return home.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.3 In a report by the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (<abbr title="UN Assistance Mission for Iraq">UNAMI</abbr>), it was stated that:</p>

<p>‘Persons with disabilities in Iraq, who have been disproportionately affected by armed conflict, violence and other emergencies, experience multiple challenges in accessing equitable services, thereby hindering full enjoyment of their rights and meaningful participation in society. Their situation has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has compounded obstacles they face in accessing protection and humanitarian<br>
assistance.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.4 The USSD annual report covering the human rights situation in 2021 noted:</p>

<p>‘Government forces, including the ISF and PMF, established or maintained roadblocks that reportedly impeded the flow of humanitarian assistance to communities in need, particularly in disputed territories such as the Ninewa Plain and Sinjar in Ninewa Province…</p>

<p>‘Security considerations, unexplode ordnance, destruction of infrastructure, COVID-19 curfews, and travel restrictions, as well as official and unofficial access restrictions, limited humanitarian access to communities in need…</p>

<p>‘Out of the estimated 2.4 million persons in need of humanitarian assistance in the country, in September alone more than 18,000 were affected by restrictions imposed on humanitarian movements, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (<abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">OCHA</abbr>). <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">OCHA</abbr> reported that while there were occasionally location- and context-specific restrictions on humanitarian <abbr title="Non-governmental organisation">NGO</abbr> operations, these were usually temporary and eventually resolved. There were few to no areas where humanitarian NGOs were categorically prevented from working. There were, however, areas of high sensitivity where militias or local security actors were less comfortable with NGOs’ presence, which generally diminished the scale and pace of humanitarian operations in those areas.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.1.5 In a report of the UN Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict in Iraq, it is stated that ‘During the reporting period [1 August 2019 to 30 June 2021], the country task force verified 317 grave violations against 254 children… Denial of humanitarian access was the second most verified violation, with 62 verified incidents.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>. It is worth noting that the estimated number of children (persons under the age of 16 years) in Iraq has been put at 16,140.142.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> People in need – numbers and location</h3>

<p>5.2.1 The <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated:</p>

<p>‘Protracted displacement has come to characterize the post-conflict environment in Iraq; about 1.2 million people remain internally displaced, more than 90 per cent of whom fled their areas of origin more than four years ago; more than two thirds fled between January 2014 and March 2015. Returns have largely stagnated, with the number of displaced Iraqis only decreasing by 35,000 people from December 2020 to September 2021. Spontaneous returns remain slow in most areas and are often unsustainable due to unresolved challenges in areas of origin, including limited infrastructure, services and livelihoods; safety and security issues; and social tensions.’</p>

<p>‘Of the 6.1 million people originally displaced, 2.5 million [6.17% of the population] continue to face humanitarian needs, including 728,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> (internally displaced persons) and 1.7 million returnees; of these just under 1 million people are in acute need, including 382,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and 579,000 returnees.</p>

<p>‘The overall number of people in need (<abbr title="People in need">PIN</abbr>) in Iraq decreased from 4.1 million people in the 2021 <abbr title="Humanitarian Needs Overview">HNO</abbr> to 2.5 million people in the 2022 <abbr title="Humanitarian Needs Overview">HNO</abbr>, a decrease of 41 per cent that partially reflects the stabilizing socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 and partially the result of a narrower focus on people with multiple humanitarian needs that require life-saving and life-sustaining assistance, rather than longer-term development and recovery assistance. See paragraph 4.2.3 for more information.</p>

<p>‘The 2.5 million people in need include 180,000 in-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>, 549,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> displaced outside camps; and 1.7 million people who have returned to their areas of origin. Among them, there are 685,000 women, 543,000 girls, 676,000 men and 550,000 boys.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.2.3 On 27 March 2022 <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> published its humanitarian response plan for Iraq in 2022. The report stated the following regarding a refinement to the criteria used for assessing humanitarian needs which decision makers should take into account when reading the following sections:</p>

<p>‘…, the humanitarian community in Iraq refined the criteria for assessing humanitarian needs. The revised criteria aimed to better identify people with the highest levels of vulnerability, particularly those with a multitude of needs, focusing on those needs that are a direct result of the impact of the <abbr title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">ISIL</abbr> crisis.</p>

<p>‘As a result of this revised approach to humanitarian needs analysis the 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (<abbr title="Humanitarian Needs Overview">HNO</abbr>) for Iraq identified 2.5 million people in need (<abbr title="People in need">PIN</abbr>), of whom 961,000 people have acute humanitarian needs, reaching extreme or catastrophic levels……[t]he number of people in need decreased by 41% compared to last year, while the number of people in acute need, reaching extreme or catastrophic levels, decreased by 61%. This reduction is largely attributable to the narrower definition of humanitarian needs, and does not reflect significant improvement in the lives of internally displaced persons (<abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>) and returnees in Iraq.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>  Education</h3>

<p>5.3.1 The <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated that approximately 681,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> and returnee children need education support which is a decrease of 57% from 2021<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup>. The report clarifies that: ‘The decrease in education needs is largely due to the adoption of a narrower definition of humanitarian education needs, focused on access to distance learning, school enrolment rates, barriers to accessing education opportunities, and lack of civil documentation.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.2 Regarding the affected population the same source stated:</p>

<p>‘In-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>: Overall, 80% of school-aged children&nbsp;(49,000 school-aged children) displaced&nbsp;in camps&nbsp;have&nbsp;emergency education needs, and 50% are in acute need. Overall, their greatest need is for civil documentation, with nearly 24 per cent of in-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> households having at least one child reportedly missing a key individual document, hindering access to education services. Camp populations are among the most vulnerable, and often lack the resources and facilities to access distance education.</p>

<p>‘Out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>: An estimated 121,000 school-aged children displaced outside formal camps need education assistance. Out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> children face significant barriers to accessing both in-person and remote learning opportunities. Their greatest need is for support with education costs, with one third of out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> reporting that the cost of schooling is the main barrier hindering attendance psychosocial support is also a critical need with 11% of out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> households reporting that their children have experienced psychosocial distress.</p>

<p>‘Returnees: Nearly 511,000 school-aged returnee children face challenges in accessing education. An estimated 12% of school-aged returnee households reported that children had dropped out of school in the previous year. Increased dropout rates are likely attributable to child labour, early marriage or barriers to accessing remote learning modalities.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.3.3 The same source additionally stated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="Internally displaced person">IDP</abbr> and returnee children’s physical, cognitive and mental well-being continues to be impacted by the years of armed conflict and protracted displacement, and by the COVID-19 pandemic. School offers a protective environment against negative coping mechanisms. Protection threats related to child recruitment into armed groups and explosive hazards are higher for boys, while girls are at increased risk of targeted kidnappings, rape, sexual violence and forced marriage, with serious mental and physical health consequences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Female-headed households are generally more likely to engage in negative coping strategies, with child marriage being slightly more prevalent in female-headed households. Children in female-headed households are also significantly more likely to engage in family or non-structured work than children in male-headed households. Furthermore, school-aged girls living with disabilities are three times more likely to experience gender-based violence (<abbr title="Gender-based violence">GBV</abbr>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2021, an estimated 223,000 vulnerable displaced and returnee girls and boys dropped out of school, an increase of 8% compared to the 2018-2019 school year, which was the last full school year without COVID-19-related school closures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 681,000 children with emergency education needs, more than 485,000 vulnerable boys and girls have not enrolled in school and are missing civil documentation, have psychosocial distress or are exposed to explosive hazards. National identity cards are necessary to access essential services, including school registration for formal education in places of displacement or returns areas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People without documentation are more likely to experience other negative conditions such as increased risk of eviction, reliance on negative coping strategies, having at least one child unable to access distance learning, increased exposure to child protection risks, and little or no access to improved sanitation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2021, approximately 650,000 vulnerable displaced and returnee girls and boys did not access distance learning or in-person education, facing severe barriers. Among these, 21% (138,000) experience severe barriers that put their health and safety at risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to online and blended education resources remains a serious challenge for displaced and returnee children due to the lack of reliable internet connectivity, unreliable electricity supply, inability to afford proper equipment for remote engagement, and related unfamiliarity with such programmes.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>  Food security</h3>

<p>5.4.1 The <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> report stated that ‘[a]pproximately 730,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees in 101 districts face challenges meeting their daily food needs… The number of people in need has remained similar to 2021, while the number of people in acute need has decreased by 48%.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup>. Regarding the affected population the same source stated:</p>

<p>‘In-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>: All <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> living in formal camps continue to rely on food assistance to meet all of their daily food needs. While nearly all (96%) in-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> report little to no hunger, most continue to rely on external assistance to avoid deterioration of their food security status…</p>

<p>‘Out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>: An estimated 130,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> living out of camps are food insecure. Governorates with the most food insecure out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> are Erbil (50,000), Ninewa (18,000), Duhok (15,000) and Al-Sulaymaniyah (11,000)… Compared to <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> living in camps, they more frequently face moderate or severe hunger, and rely on crisis- and emergency-level coping strategies, such as child labour or child marriage to generate income to meet their basic food needs. The number of food insecure out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> has slightly increased compared to 2021, linked to secondary displacement due to camp closures and challenges for out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> in accessing livelihoods opportunities…</p>

<p>‘Returnees: An estimated 420,000 returnees are food insecure and lack access to livelihoods. Returnees living in critical shelter are up to 5 times more likely to experience food insecurity than those in more sustainable dwellings. Governorates with the highest number of food insecure returnees are Ninewa (158,000), Al-Anbar (124,000), Salah Al-Din (59,000) and Kirkuk (28,000).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>

<p>5.4.2 1. The same source additionally stated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Food insecurity among <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees in Iraq continues to be primarily linked to their displacement status, resulting in high levels of aid dependency, particularly in camps, as well as challenges establishing sustainable livelihoods and accessing predictable income sources.</li>
  <li>This is particularly true for people missing civil documentation required for employment or to access the government’s social safety nets, and for people living in displacement or returns areas with limited job opportunities.</li>
  <li>Of the 730,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees with humanitarian food security needs, 626,000 have borderline or poor food consumption, 425,790 of whom are returnees, 179,629 out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and 21,000 in-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>. Of the mentioned total, 213,000 individuals face poor food consumption and severe hunger.</li>
  <li>The highest levels of food insecurity are found in Al-Falluja District (189,000 people), followed by Al-Hawiga (49,000), Heet (50,000), Erbil (49,000) and Al-Hatra (31,000) districts.</li>
  <li>Among out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr>, those missing core civil documentation are three times more likely to experience food insecurity, while among returnees, female-headed households are nearly three times more likely to face moderate or severe hunger. For both population groups, households with a family member living with disabilities are 2-3 times more likely to experience food insecurity.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup>

<p>‘The conflict in Ukraine had a severe impact on global supply chains during the reporting period, negatively affecting food prices and wheat imports and threatening food security in Iraq. In that regard, WFP noted a 16% increase in the average price of vegetable oil in Iraq during the first two weeks of March, while the average price of wheat flour increased by 9% at the national level during the same period. The year-on-year increase in the price of wheat flour was 26%.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup></p>

Among them, over 533,000 people are in acute need. The decrease in needs is primarily due to a narrower definition of humanitarian shelter needs, focusing on people living in critical shelter, including tents, unfinished and abandoned structures, makeshift shelter, and non-residential, public and religious buildings; and in sub-standard shelter that poses risks to residents’ health, safety and dignity. A far greater number of conflict-affected people, particularly returnees, have shelter needs that require longer-term solutions falling outside the scope of the humanitarian response.’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup> Regarding the affected population the same source stated:</p>

  <li>
    <p>However, in Al-Basrah, Al-Sulaymaniyah, Diyala and Erbil, an increase in <abbr title="Water, sanitation and hygiene">WASH</abbr> needs is observed.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The highest severity of needs is in hard-to-reach districts hosting out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees.

<span class="number">5.8 </span> Humanitarian response plan (<abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>5.8.1 On 13 April 2022 <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr> published a humanitarian update which looked at events between January and March 2022. The bulletin provided a summary of <abbr title="UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs">UNOCHA</abbr>’s humanitarian response plan (<abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr>) for 2022 which stated:</p>

<p>‘Based on the tighter humanitarian needs analysis and the agreed targeting criteria, the 2022 Iraq <abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr> will prioritize life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance for 991,000 Iraqi <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees, including 180,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> in formal camps, 234,000 <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> living in out-of-camp areas, and 577,000 returnees. The total cost of the response, as outlined in the <abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr>, amounts to US$400 million. The 2022 <abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr> focuses on providing safe and dignified living conditions, protecting <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees from physical and mental harm related to the impact of the <abbr title="Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant">ISIL</abbr> crisis.</p>

<p>‘Humanitarian actors seek to improve unsafe living environments for people living in camps, informal sites or other critical shelter - or in areas with EO contamination - while also providing specialized protection services to the people most at risk of rights violations, violence, abuse and other serious protection risks. Humanitarian partners will provide support to vulnerable <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees to access essential services that they are otherwise unable to access, either because they face specific barriers or because they live in areas where services and infrastructure have not yet been rehabilitated. The most acutely vulnerable <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> and returnees will be supported with emergency food assistance, emergency livelihoods support and temporary cash to meet their most basic needs and avoid reliance on harmful negative coping mechanisms for their survival.</p>

<p>‘The 991,000 acutely vulnerable people who will be the focused target of this <abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr>, are located across 14 of the 18 governorates of Iraq. The 6 governorates with the highest target populations are Ninewa (356,000 people), Al-Anbar (166,000), Duhok (155,000), Salah Al-Din (92,000), Kirkuk (66,000) and Diyala (55,000). The largest numbers of in-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> targeted through the <abbr title="Humanitarian response plan">HRP</abbr> are in Duhok (110,000), Ninewa (45,000), Erbil (14,000) and Al-Sulaymaniyah (11,000), while the governorates hosting the most out-of-camp <abbr title="Internally displaced persons">IDPs</abbr> are Ninewa (60,000), Duhok (46,000), Erbil (34,000) and Al-Anbar (24,000). For returnees, the largest number is also in Ninewa (249,000), followed by Al-Anbar (141,000), Salah Al-Din (73, 000), Kirkuk (54,000) and Diyala (45,000).’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup></p>
