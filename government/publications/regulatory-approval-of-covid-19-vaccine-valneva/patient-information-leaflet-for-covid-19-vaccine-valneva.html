<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>1.What COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is and what it is used for</h2>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is a vaccine used to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is given to adults aged between 18 and 50 years.</p>

<p>The vaccine causes the immune system (the body’s natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that works against the virus so giving protection against COVID-19.</p>

<p>None of the ingredients in this vaccine can cause COVID-19.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>2.What you need to know before your child receives Comirnaty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva must not be given</h3>
<ul>
  <li>if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Warnings and precautions</h3>
<p>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva in the past</li>
  <li>you have ever fainted following any needle injection or if you have anxiety related to injections</li>
  <li>you have a severe illness or infection with high fever. You can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold</li>
  <li>you have a problem with bleeding, you bruise easily or if you use a medicine to prevent blood clots</li>
  <li>you have a weakened immune system because of a disease such as HIV infection or you are taking medicines, such as corticosteroid, that affect your immune system</li>
</ul>

<p>Two doses of COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva are necessary to start protecting you. As with any vaccine, even the 2-dose vaccination course may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. No data are currently available in individuals with a weakened immune system or who are taking chronic treatment that suppresses or prevents immune responses.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Children and adolescents</h3>
<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is not recommended for children and adolescents aged below 18 years. Currently there is not enough information available on the use of COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva in children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Other medicines and COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva</h3>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or other vaccines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</h3>
<p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you receive this vaccine.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Driving and using machines</h3>
<p>Some of the side effects of COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva listed in section 4 may temporarily affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva contains potassium and sodium</h3>
<p>This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, i.e. essentially ‘potassium-free’.</p>

<p>This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>3.How COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is given</h2>

<p>COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva is given as an injection of 0.5 mL into a muscle of your upper arm.</p>

<p>You will receive 2 injections of the same vaccine, given at least 28 days apart to complete the vaccination course.</p>

<p>If you miss an appointment for your second injection of COVID-19 Vaccine Valneva, it is important that you return for your second injection as you are not protected against COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.</p>
