<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">All Our Health</a>, a resource which helps health and care professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice.</p>

<p>This information will help front-line health and care staff use their trusted relationships with individuals, families and communities to promote the benefits of attending an NHS Health Check.</p>

<p>This guide promotes the benefits of attending an NHS Health Check and provides information on what health and care professionals can do to help a person reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, once they have had an NHS Health Check.</p>

<p>Health and care professionals play an important role in supporting members of the public with evidence-based risk reduction interventions such as accessing behavioural programmes and pharmacological treatments, which will support them to lower or manage their risk of premature death and ill health.</p>

<p>We also recommend important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<p>Further information is provided by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">full range of All Our Health topics</a>.</p>

<h2>Access the NHS health checks e-learning session</h2>

<p>An interactive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/596370" rel="external">e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) and Health Education England’s ‘e-Learning for Healthcare’ have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<p>Completing this session will count towards your continued professional development.</p>

<h3>Promoting the NHS Health Check in your professional practice</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS Health Check</a> offers advice to help prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease for eligible people - not currently on a cardiovascular disease register or being treated as at risk - aged between 40 and 74.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases are amongst the preventable forms of non-communicable diseases, of which England faces an epidemic that includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>cancer</li>
  <li>diabetes</li>
  <li>dementia</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-communicable disease and disability has the greatest impact on the most deprived communities, so the NHS Health Check provides an opportunity to address entrenched health inequalities. While cancer prevention is not an aim of the programme, many of the risk factors are the same.</p>

<p>The NHS Health Check programme aims to prevent cardiovascular disease, and associated conditions, through the early assessment, awareness and management of individual behavioural and physiological risk factors.</p>

<p>In doing so it promotes the early identification of cardiovascular disease and the other associated conditions. It also supports individuals to manage and reduce behavioural risks and associated conditions through information and evidence-based risk reduction interventions.</p>

<p>The programme has the potential to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prevent 1,600 heart attacks and strokes</li>
  <li>prevent 4,000 people a year from developing diabetes</li>
  <li>detect 20,000 cases of diabetes or kidney disease each year</li>
  <li>avoid at least 650 premature deaths a year</li>
</ul>

<p>A total of 15 million people are eligible for free NHS Health Checks in England.</p>

<p>Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, responsibility for commissioning and monitoring the programme passed to local authorities.</p>

<p>Therefore, local authorities have a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/351/regulation/4/made" rel="external">legal responsibility</a>  to offer an NHS Health Check to 100% of their eligible population once every five years.</p>

<h2>Core principles for health and care professionals</h2>

<p>This ‘All Our Health’ NHS Health Check information has been created to help all health and care professionals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the specific activities and interventions of the NHS Health Check that can help prevent the onset of cardiovascular disease</li>
  <li>think about the resources and services available in their area, that can help people to find out about the NHS Health Check and subsequent risk reduction interventions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking action</h2>

<p>If you’re a front-line health professional:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand your role in helping people reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease</li>
  <li>familiarise yourself with the local NHS Health Check service, and know how individuals can access this as well as subsequent risk reduction interventions in your area</li>
  <li>check if eligible patients aged 40 to 74 have been offered an NHS Health Check</li>
  <li>promote and encourage eligible people who you may come into contact with as part of your work, to have an NHS Health Check</li>
  <li>access training to become more confident in identifying, managing and communicating cardiovascular risk to individuals you may care for within your practice</li>
  <li>use everyday interactions with people to discuss the importance of knowing and understanding their cardiovascular risk or heart age, and communicating ‘what’s good for the heart is good for the brain’</li>
</ul>

<p>If delivering NHS Health Checks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use best practice and ensure that National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance is followed throughout the NHS Health Check pathway</li>
  <li>ensure your competencies and skills are in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/commissioners-and-providers/training/competency-framework-and-learner-and-assessor-workbooks/" rel="external">NHS Health Check Competence Framework</a>, and access any training where required</li>
  <li>promote and support the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/109-better-health-adult-obesity" rel="external">Better Health Campaign</a>, which encourages positive behavioural change and take-up of the NHS Health Check</li>
  <li>promote the use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/for-your-body/check-your-health/heart-age-test/" rel="external">Heart Age Test</a> which encourages people to better understand their heart health and provides them with advice on reducing their heart age and promote the message that ‘what’s good for the heart is good for the brain’</li>
  <li>familiarise yourself with England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/14/health-matters-preventing-cardiovascular-disease/" rel="external">cardiovascular disease prevention ambitions</a> and seek opportunities to get involved in supporting their delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a team leader or manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure the teams you manage are aware of NHS Health Check services within your local area</li>
  <li>share <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/commissioners-and-providers/evidence/" rel="external">information and evidence about the NHS Health Check</a> with your teams, in a format that is accessible for all</li>
  <li>promote a team culture where staff know that they should talk to individuals about the NHS Health Check</li>
  <li>provide learning and development opportunities on <abbr title="cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> prevention, and on communicating <abbr title="cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr> risk for team members</li>
  <li>allow staff time to access an NHS Health Check and promote this opportunity within your own teams</li>
  <li>if appropriate, consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-health-check-programme-research-priorities">NHS Health Check research and evaluation opportunities</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a senior or strategic leader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/cardiovascular-disease-prevention" rel="external">Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Packs</a>
</li>
  <li>use national data profiles or tools to understand the health needs of the local population and know the local services available - such as NHS Health Check providers, stop smoking services and weight management services</li>
  <li>promote the NHS Health Check as a route through which to detect, manage and prevent non-communicable disease</li>
  <li>work in partnership with local authority public health teams to ensure that the NHS Health Check is reaching high-risk and vulnerable communities</li>
  <li>support and promote community-based health and wellbeing services, which will benefit local service users</li>
  <li>if you are an NHS Health Check provider, look at the education and training needs of the workforce, to equip them to deliver high-quality checks</li>
  <li>seek opportunities to work collaboratively with local partners, including sustainability and transformations partnerships (<abbr title="sustainability and transformations partnerships">STPS</abbr>) and integrated care systems (<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICS</abbr>) to ensure the NHS Health Check is embedded as part of wider prevention initiatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<h3>NHS Health Check Data</h3>

<p>You can explore your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/nhs-health-check-detailed/data#page/0/gid/1938132726/pat/6/par/E12000004/ati/102/are/E06000015" rel="external">NHS Health Check data</a> using the heat map, which provides information on offers and uptake of the checks by region and local authority area.</p>

<p>The NHS Health Check interactive data dashboard provides data on the characteristics of those attending and not attending NHS Health Checks using GP records from 9.5 million people between 2012 to 2018.</p>

<h2>National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network</h2>

<p>Public Health England provides intelligence and data through the National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network (<abbr title="National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network">NCVIN</abbr>). This information is useful to identify how well people are being diagnosed and treated for <abbr title="cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>. It includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/cardiovascular-disease-prevention" rel="external">Cardiovascular Disease prevention packs</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health and care professional, there are a range of reasons why it makes sense to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution.</p>

<p>This could be about sharing what has worked well in order to benefit your colleagues and local people - or help you with your professional development.</p>

<h2>Ready Reckoner</h2>

<p>The impact of the NHS Health Check on local populations can be assessed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/commissioners-and-providers/delivery/making-the-case/" rel="external">Ready Reckoner</a>.</p>

<p>The NHS Health Check Ready Reckoner helps health and social care commissioners, providers, elected members, local government officers as well as academics, to give an idea of the potential cost savings that can be made by NHS Health Checks.</p>

<h2>Public Health Outcomes Framework</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-health-outcomes-framework">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> examines indicators that help us understand trends in public health such as premature mortality in individuals with <abbr title="cardiovascular disease">CVD</abbr>. There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">3 indicators related to NHS Health Check</a> and a number of additional indicators related to cardiovascular disease.</p>
