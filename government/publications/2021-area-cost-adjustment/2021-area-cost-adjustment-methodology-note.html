<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Policy background</h2>

<p>This note provides the methodology to calculate the Area Cost Adjustments (<abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>). This <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> is referred to as the 2021 <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> and is an update to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-emergency-funding-for-local-government">Covid <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr></a>. The 2021 <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> was used in the calculation of the 2022/23 Local Council Tax Support (<abbr title="Local Council Tax Support">LCTS</abbr>) admin subsidy Grant.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> is a tool used to measure the variation in the cost of providing services for local authorities in England. The cost of providing services varies between local authorities due to several internal and market factors. The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> only measures the market factors such as the cost of labour, rent, and accessibility within local authorities. The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> is used to compensate local authorities that experience higher costs when providing services. The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> consists of the three adjustment factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Labour cost adjustment (<abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>)</strong> - which measures the difference in the cost of labour between local authorities.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Rates cost adjustment (<abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr>)</strong> - which measures the difference in the cost of property rates/rents between local authorities.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Accessibility</strong> - which measures the impact of the difference in travel time to provide services on the cost of labour. 
This factor consists of a Dispersal adjustment factor and a Traversal adjustment factor. They are measured using journey time data and combined with the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> since they are measures of additional labour cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>The government is committed to funding councils based on an accurate and up-to-date assessment of their needs, including variation in the cost of delivering services due to local factors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Data and methodology</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>	Overview</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>, <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr> and Journey Times measures are each calculated as indices with a mean of 1, with higher cost authorities scoring above one and vice versa. The following tables summarise the methodologies and rationale for calculating each index. <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-equations">Annex B</a> provides the technical regression specifications for the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	Weights</h2>

<p>3.1	Components of the <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> are weighted together into a single index for the relevant service area.</p>

<p>3.2	Weights for the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr> are determined using two data sources: Revenue Outturn (<abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr>) and Subjective Analysis Return (<abbr title="Subjective Analysis Return">SAR</abbr>). <abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr> statistics show the actual revenue spending of all local authorities in England using the final audited financial accounts where possible. A sample of authorities in England complete the <abbr title="Subjective Analysis Return">SAR</abbr> to give a detailed breakdowns of spending within services. Since data aggregated at the service level is used to calculate the weights, the final ACAs for individual authorities are not dependent directly on their <abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr> or <abbr title="Subjective Analysis Return">SAR</abbr> return.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local authorities record the split of their spending on each service line in the <abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr> between: âemployee costsâ and ârunning costsâ.</li>
  <li>Next, we identify the components of âRunning Costsâ. The <abbr title="Subjective Analysis Return">SAR</abbr> collates authoritiesâ break down of running costs into categories and we assign these categories to the most appropriate components of the <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c-sar">Annex C</a> for a full list).</li>
  <li>The cost of spending for some categories is assumed to vary with one of the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>, <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr> or accessibility (for example, agency staff costs are assigned to the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>).</li>
  <li>Some categories are assumed to be unaffected by any components of the <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> and remain <strong>unadjusted</strong> (for example, energy costs are assumed not to vary geographically).</li>
  <li>Some categories are assumed to be affected by all three factors and are <strong>split</strong> (for example, contracted services).</li>
</ul>

<p>3.3	In line with the previous Area Cost Adjustments, we assume 70% of contracted costs are labour costs, so assume 70% of the split category refers to employee costs and 30% refers to running costs. We apply the weights from the previous step to split the ârunning costsâ of those categories assigned to âsplitâ.</p>

<p>3.4	Adding the employee costs from the <abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr> to the labour costs from within running costs and splitting insurance costs according to these weights, we get a final weight for the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr>.</p>

<p>3.5	Accessibility is a measure of additional <strong>employee time</strong> needed to deliver services owing to journey times and is therefore applied to the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>. Weights for Accessibility are determined using the National Transport Survey or service specific cost modelling where data is available.</p>

<p>3.6	The default weight is calculated using the average number of <strong>hours per year spent travelling for work</strong> by relevant workers in the National Transport Survey (NTS), as a proportion of all paid time.</p>

<p>3.7	Once the weights are determined, the indices are combined to form ACAs. The weights are found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-a-weightings">Annex A</a> and the equations in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-equations">Annex B</a>.</p>

<p>3.8	All indices are calculated at lower and upper tier levels, with separate regressions for each tier.</p>

<p>3.9	51% and 57% of the weight is allocated to the labour cost adjustment for the lower tier and upper tier foundation formula ACAs respectively, as labour costs are the biggest expenditure for local authorities. A lower weighting is given to the rates cost adjustment, as a minority of local authority running costs are impacted by rent costs. Accessibility (dispersal and traversal) weights are combined with the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> weight before being applied to the <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> adjustment factor as both weights are related to the cost of labour.</p>

<p>3.10	The <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> weight, <abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr> weight and Unadjusted weights all sum to 1 for each spending area. Accessibility weights are separate as they form the Adjusted <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4	Comparison </span> to previous ACAs</h2>

<p>4.1	<strong>2013/14 <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>:</strong> there are several differences to the 2021 <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>. These can be summarised as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated data and Local Authority Geographies.</li>
  <li>The addition of dispersal and traversal adjustment factors.</li>
  <li>A move away from discrete tier <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> index values to each local authority having a unique <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> index value calculated from input data drawn directly from that local authority.</li>
  <li>Changes to how the <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> is calculated for different tiers. Adjustment factors are calculated from the input data separately for different tiers , to remove the influence population has on the <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> outputs.</li>
  <li>Capping of the City of London Accessibility adjustment factor values (see Other Assumptions).</li>
</ul>

<p>4.2	<strong>Covid <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>:</strong> the 2021 <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> uses the same methodology as the Covid <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>. The main differences between these two updates can be summarised by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated input data which included using 2017-2019 ASHE final data, updated <abbr title="Revenue Outturn">RO</abbr> data and <abbr title="Subjective Analysis Return">SAR</abbr> data to calculate the weights, updated data on hours spent travelling for work in the NTS.</li>
  <li>New Local Authority Geographies which included values for North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Rates cost adjustment">RCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Labour cost adjustment">LCA</abbr> indices calculated through regression analysis for both upper and lower tier rather than using a population-based conversion approach taken in Covid <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5	Other </span> assumptions</h2>

<p>5.1	<strong>Capping the City of London (<abbr title="City of London">CoL</abbr>) Accessibility values</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The <abbr title="City of London">CoL</abbr>âs dispersal value is 134% larger than the mean value for other Inner London Boroughs (ILBs). This is because the Cityâs population is less than 10,000 people, which is required to be a âhub townâ, therefore journeys are measured to other ILBs.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="City of London">CoL</abbr>âs traversal value is 63% higher than the mean value for other ILBs. Due to the small population, the <abbr title="City of London">CoL</abbr> only has 5 LSOAs, compared with 20-30+ other London boroughs. Therefore there are fewer possible connections between neighbouring LSOAs, increasing journey times.</li>
  <li>Therefore, due to the un-naturally high values from the <abbr title="City of London">CoL</abbr>âs unique characteristics, the Cityâs traversal and dispersal values are capped at the median values for all other ILBs.</li>
</ul>
