<p>Application for registration as a British citizen by a person who has made a declaration of renunciation</p>

<p>March 2019</p>
</div>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guide is for people who have renounced British citizenship or citizenship of the 
United Kingdom and Colonies and who now wish to resume citizenship and be 
registered as British citizens.</p>

<p>The law covering registration is set out in the British Nationality Act 1981 and the 
regulations made under it. The information given here is meant only as a brief guide 
to the law and to the Home Secretary’s policy. It is not a comprehensive statement of 
either the law or the policy.</p>

<h3>OISC and Immigration Advice</h3>

<p>You may, if you wish, use the services of an agent such as a solicitor or other 
competent adviser to help you with your application.</p>

<p>Immigration or nationality advisers acting in the course of business (whether paid or 
unpaid) are regulated by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-immigration-services-commissioner">Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner 
(OISC)</a>, an independent body. The provision of such advice is prohibited unless a 
person works for an organisation registered with, or exempted by, the OISC or is 
authorised to practise (like solicitors and barristers) by a designated professional 
body. Certain categories (for example public health bodies) are exempted from the 
regulatory scheme by Ministerial Order. It is a criminal offence to provide advice or 
services in contravention of the regulatory scheme. Further information about the 
regulatory scheme and a full list of OISC regulated advisers is available on its 
website.</p>

<h2>The requirements you must meet</h2>

<p>You will be entitled to registration if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are of sound mind and</li>
  <li>you are of good character and</li>
</ul>

<p>either</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have made a declaration of renunciation renouncing British citizenship 
(after
1 January 1983),</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>(before 1 January 1983) you have made a declaration of renunciation 
renouncing citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies</li>
</ul>

<p>and either</p>

<ul>
  <li>you</li>
  <li>your father</li>
  <li>your father’s father</li>
  <li>your husband, wife or civil partner</li>
  <li>your husband’s, wife’s or civil partner’s father</li>
  <li>your husband’s, wife’s or civil partner’s father’s father was:
    <ul>
      <li>born in the United Kingdom, or</li>
      <li>naturalised in the United Kingdom, or</li>
      <li>registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies in the United
Kingdom or</li>
      <li>registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies in an 
independent Commonwealth country. (The country concerned must have 
been an independent member of the Commonwealth at the time of the 
registration – see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#dates-of-independence">list of countries which were in the Commonwealth 
before 1983</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Home Secretary has discretion to waive the requirement to be of sound 
mind if they think that would be the right thing to do in any particular case.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom means England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the 
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>

<h3>Do you have a right to registration?</h3>

<p>You have a right (once only) to be registered as a British citizen if you 
previously renounced British citizenship in order to keep or acquire another 
citizenship.</p>

<p>You have a separate right (once only) to be registered as a British citizen if you 
previously renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in order to keep or acquire the citizenship of a Commonwealth country, or</li>
  <li>because you had reasonable cause to believe that you would be deprived of 
your citizenship of a Commonwealth country if you did not renounce.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you renounced citizenship for any other reason, or if you have already 
renounced and resumed British citizenship (as a right), registration is at the 
discretion of the Home Secretary. Registration will be granted if they see fit.</p>

<h3>The citizenship you will acquire</h3>

<p>In general terms, you will become a British citizen by descent if, before renouncing, 
you were a British citizen by descent.</p>

<p>If you had renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies you will 
become a British citizen by descent if you would have become a British citizen by 
descent, had you not renounced.</p>

<h3>Effect of registration on present citizenship</h3>

<p>You do not have to give up your present citizenship or nationality to become a 
British citizen. But under the nationality laws of some countries, a person 
automatically loses their existing nationality if they become a citizen of another
country. Before you apply for British citizenship you should consider checking what 
your position would be with the authorities of the country of which you are a citizen.</p>

<p>Further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen">requirements for British citizenship</a> is available on our website.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man you should contact the
Lieutenant – Governor’s office</li>
  <li>If you are in a British overseas territory, contact the Governor’s office.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good Character</h3>

<p>To be of good character you should have shown respect for the rights and freedoms 
of the UK, observe its laws and fulfilled your duties and obligations as a resident of 
the UK. Checks will be carried out to ensure that the information you give is correct.</p>

<p>If you are not honest about the information you provide, and you are registered on 
the basis of incorrect or fraudulent information you will be liable to have British 
citizenship taken away (deprivation) and you may be prosecuted. It is a criminal 
offence to make a false declaration knowing that it is untrue.</p>

<p>Among the duties and obligations which you are expected to fulfil is payment of 
income tax and National Insurance contributions. We may ask H.M. Revenue &amp; 
Customs for confirmation that your tax and National Insurance affairs are in order.</p>

<p>If you do not pay income tax through PAYE you must demonstrate that you have 
discharged your obligations towards the H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs, by attaching a 
Self Assessment Statement of Account.</p>

<p>You must give details of all criminal convictions both within and outside the UK. 
These include road traffic offences.</p>

<p>Fixed penalty notices (such as speeding or parking tickets) must be disclosed, 
although will not normally be taken into account unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have failed to pay and there were criminal proceedings as a result</li>
  <li>you received 3 or more fixed penalty notices at any level</li>
  <li>in the past 3 years you received 2 or more fixed penalty notices, at least one 
of which was at the upper levels (fine of £200 or more).</li>
</ul>

<p>We will consider the applications against the factors listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance">Good Character 
Guidance</a> at Considering cumulative, non-custodial sentences.</p>

<p>Where a fixed penalty notice or fiscal fine has been referred to a court due to non-payment, or the notice has been unsuccessfully challenged by the person in court, 
we will consider it as a conviction and assess it in line with the new sentence 
imposed.</p>

<p>Drink driving offences must be declared. If you have any endorsements on your 
driving licence you must provide the paper counterpart.</p>

<p>A driving conviction may not be disregarded despite any penalty points being 
removed from your driving licence.</p>

<p>Criminal record checks will be carried out in all cases. If you have a conviction within 
the relevant sentence based threshold you are unlikely to be registered as a British 
citizen. Similarly, if you have been charged with a criminal offence and are awaiting 
trial or sentencing, you are advised not to make any application for registration until 
the outcome is known. If you are convicted, you should then consult the table below.</p>

<h4>4 Years or more imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused, 
regardless of when the conviction 
occurred.</p>

<h4>Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 15 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<h4>Up to 12 months imprisonment</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused 
unless 10 years have passed since 
the end of the sentence.</p>

<h4>A non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record</h4>

<p>Application will normally be refused if 
the conviction occurred in the last 3 
years.</p>

<h4>Notes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A person who receives a sentence of life imprisonment is included in the ‘4 
years or more imprisonment’ category.</li>
  <li>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 4 years is included in 
the ‘4 years or more imprisonment’ category.</li>
  <li>A person who receives a custodial sentence of exactly 12 months or exactly 1 
year is included in the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment’ 
category.</li>
  <li>The “end of the sentence” means the entire sentence imposed, not just the time 
the person spent in prison. For example, a person sentenced to 3 years’ 
imprisonment on 1/1/2013 will normally be refused citizenship until 1/1/2031 –
the 15 year ‘bar’ added to the 3 year sentence.</li>
  <li>A “non-custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is recorded on a 
person’s criminal record” includes Fines, Cautions, Warnings and Reprimands, 
Community Sentences, Civil Orders, Hospital Orders &amp; Restriction Orders and 
Potential Court Orders.</li>
  <li>A person who is subject of an extant Deportation Order will be refused 
citizenship regardless of when they apply.</li>
  <li>Some extremely short periods of imprisonment may not be included in the ‘up 
to 12 months imprisonment’ category. This will depend on whether the person 
was convicted &amp; sentenced or simply committed to prison. The latter is not a 
sentence and the vast majority of those detained for one day– will have been 
committed by the court and not sentenced. The decision maker will instead 
treat this as a “non- custodial offence or other out of court disposal that is 
recorded on a person’s criminal record”.</li>
  <li>A suspended prison sentence will be treated as a “non-custodial offence or 
other out of court disposal that is recorded on a person’s criminal record”.</li>
  <li>The exception is where that sentence is subsequently ‘activated’. This means 
that the person re-offended or failed to adhere to/breached the conditions of 
that sentence. Where this happens, the sentence length will be the one 
originally imposed.
    <ul>
      <li>Example 1: a person is sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 
two years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 6 months and fall into 
the ‘up to 12 months’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
      <li>Example 2: a person is sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 
two years. If they ‘activate’ this, the sentence should be 12 months and fall into 
the ‘Between 12 months and 4 years’ imprisonment’ category above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sentences imposed overseas will normally be treated as if they occurred in the 
UK.</li>
  <li>For concurrent sentences, the decision maker will take the longest single 
sentence imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment served 
concurrently with a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the 
same as one 9-month sentence.</li>
  <li>For consecutive sentences, the decision maker will add together the total of all 
the sentences imposed. For example, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment 
served consecutively with a of 6 months’ imprisonment will be treated the same 
as one 15month sentence.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are also advised to refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-character-nationality-policy-guidance">good character policy guidance</a> which 
caseworkers use to decide your application. This is available on the website.</p>

<p>You must give details of all civil judgments which have resulted in a court order 
being made against you as well as any civil penalties under the UK Immigration 
Acts. If you have been declared bankrupt at any time you should give details of the 
bankruptcy proceedings. (Your application is unlikely to succeed if you are an 
undischarged bankrupt).</p>

<p>You do not need to give details of family law proceedings such as divorce decrees, 
dissolved civil partnerships, guardianship orders, parental responsibility orders.</p>

<p>You must give details of any cautions (simple or conditional), warnings or 
reprimands you have received in the UK or any other country. Cautions, warnings 
and reprimands are out of court disposals that are recorded on a person’s criminal 
record and are taken in to account when assessing a person’s character.</p>

<p>You must say if your details have been recorded by the police as a result of certain 
sexual offences, or if you are subject to one of the following orders: notification 
order, sexual offences prevention order, foreign travel order, risk of sexual harm 
order (or equivalent order made in a British overseas territory or any other country). 
If your details are recorded on the “sex offenders” register, even if any conviction is 
spent, the Home Secretary is unlikely to be satisfied that you meet the good 
character requirement and so an application for citizenship is unlikely to be 
successful.</p>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court or which is 
awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and 
waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not 
told that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, 
you may wish to confirm the position with the police. For applicants from Scotland 
any recent civil penalties must also be declared. You must tell us if you are 
arrested or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the 
application is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the 
British Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must also say whether you have had any involvement in terrorism. If you do 
not regard something as an act of terrorism but you know that others do or might, 
you should mention it. You must also say whether you have been involved in any 
crimes in the course of armed conflict, including crimes against humanity, war 
crimes or genocide. If you are in any doubt as to whether something should be 
mentioned, you should mention it.</p>

<p>You should refer to the definitions in this Guide on actions which may constitute 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>

<p>This guidance is not exhaustive. Before you answer these questions you should 
consider the full definitions of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide 
which can be found in Schedule 8 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010017.htm" rel="external">International Criminal Court Act 2001</a>.
Alternatively, copies can be purchased from The Stationery Office, telephone 0870 
600 5522.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that you are familiar with the definitions 
and can answer the questions accurately.</p>

<h4>Genocide</h4>

<p>Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial 
or religious group.</p>

<h4>Crimes against humanity</h4>

<p>Acts committed at any time (not just during armed conflict) as part of a widespread 
or systematic attack, directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the 
attack. This would include offences such as murder, torture, rape, severe deprivation 
of liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law and enforced 
disappearance of persons.</p>

<h4>War Crimes</h4>

<p>Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions committed during an armed conflict. 
This includes an internal armed conflict and an international armed conflict. The 
types of acts that may constitute a war crime include wilful killing, torture, extensive 
destruction of property not justified by military necessity, unlawful deportation, the 
intentional targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages.</p>

<h4>Terrorist Activities</h4>

<p>Any act committed, or the threat of action, designed to influence a government or 
intimidate the public and made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or 
ideological cause and that involves serious violence against a person; that may 
endanger another person’s life; creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the 
public; involves serious damage to property; is designed to seriously disrupt or 
interfere with an electronic system.</p>

<h4>Organisations concerned in terrorism</h4>

<p>An organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commits or participates in acts of terrorism,</li>
  <li>prepares for terrorism,</li>
  <li>promotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of 
terrorism), or</li>
  <li>is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deception</h4>

<p>If you have practised deception in your dealings with the Home Office or other 
Government Departments (such as by providing false information or fraudulent 
documents) this will be taken in to account in considering whether you meet the 
good character requirement.</p>

<p>Your application will be refused if you have attempted to deceive the Home Office 
within the last 10 years.</p>

<h4>Immigration Related Issues</h4>

<p>Your application may also be refused if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/naturalisation-as-a-british-citizen-by-discretion-nationality-policy-guidance">evaded immigration control</a> in the 
last 10 years or helped someone else to evade immigration control or employed 
illegal workers, at any time. Full details of our policy can be seen on the website.</p>

<h4>Deprivation</h4>

<p>You may be deprived of your British citizenship if it is found to have been obtained by 
fraud, false representation or the concealment of any material fact. The Home 
Secretary may also deprive you of British citizenship if they are satisfied that 
deprivation is conducive to the public good and you would not be made stateless. 
Following the Immigration Act 2014, the Home Secretary may also deprive naturalised 
persons of their British citizenship if the person has conducted themselves in a 
manner which is seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom and 
the Home Secretary has reasonable grounds for believing the person is able, under 
the law of another country to become a national of that country or territory.</p>

<p>A registration may, as a matter of law, be ineffective from the outset if it is obtained 
by means of impersonation.</p>

<h4>What if you haven’t been convicted but your character may be in doubt?</h4>

<p>You must say if there is any offence for which you may go to court or which is 
awaiting hearing in court. This includes having been arrested for an offence and 
waiting to hear if you will be formally charged. If you have been arrested and not told 
that charges have been dropped, or that you will not have to appear in court, you 
may wish to confirm the position with the police. You must tell us if you are arrested 
or charged with an offence after you make your application and while the application 
is under consideration. You risk prosecution under section 46 of the British 
Nationality Act 1981 if you do not do so.</p>

<p>You must say whether you have been involved in anything which might indicate that 
you are not of good character. You must give information about any of these 
activities no matter how long ago this was. Checks will be made in all cases and your 
application may fail and your fee will not be fully refunded if you make an untruthful 
declaration. If you are in any doubt about whether you have done something or it has 
been alleged that you have done something which might lead us to think that you are 
not of good character you should say so.</p>

<h2>Biometric Enrolment</h2>

<p>As part of your application, all applicants are required to enrol their biometric details 
for the purpose of identity verification.</p>

<p>Children under 18 applying for registration as a British citizen must also enrol their 
biometric details. Children under the age of 6 do not need to provide fingerprints, but 
must have a digital photograph taken of their face.</p>

<p>Up to the age of 6 the Home Office only requires a digitised image of the child’s face, 
although the regulation does not prevent fingerprints being recorded from children 
aged less than 6 years. There is no upper age limit for biometric information to be 
taken.</p>

<p>Children under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian at 
their biometric enrolment appointment.</p>

<p>Where you give your biometric information depends on how you’re making your visa 
or immigration application. You’ll be told where to go after you’ve applied.</p>

<p>Your application may be rejected as invalid if you do not enrol your biometrics when 
requested. For more information about enrolling biometrics and the current fee, 
please visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits">biometric residence permits</a> section of our website.</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>This section tells you the sort of documents you will need to provide so we 
can consider your application. We cannot consider your application unless we 
have supporting documents.</p>

<p>You must provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your copy of your Declaration of Renunciation (for example: form RN1, RN2, 
RN3, RN or form R6).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Evidence of your present citizenship or nationality
    <ul>
      <li>your passport or certificate of naturalisation or registration</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies – evidence of 
your connection with the United Kingdom:
    <ul>
      <li>the birth, naturalisation or registration certificate of the person through whom 
you have the connection</li>
      <li>evidence of your relationship to them, for example - birth, marriage or civil 
partnership certificates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evidence that if you had not made a declaration of renunciation you would have 
lost or failed to acquire the citizenship or nationality of another country. This 
applies if you renounced British citizenship for another citizenship or if you 
renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies for the citizenship of 
a Commonwealth country.
    <ul>
      <li>A letter or statement confirming this from the authorities of the country 
concerned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies because you 
believed you would be deprived of your citizenship of a Commonwealth country 
unless you did so, include an explanation of why you believed this. If you have 
any documentary evidence, include it with your application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Citizenship ceremonies</h2>

<p>If your application is successful and you are living in the UK, you will be invited to 
attend a citizenship ceremony. You will receive an invitation from the Home Office 
and this will confirm the local authority you should contact to arrange your 
ceremony. We expect you to arrange to attend a ceremony within 3 months of 
receiving your invitation otherwise it will expire and you will have to reapply for 
registration and pay a further processing fee.</p>

<p>If you are living abroad, your citizenship ceremony will take place at the embassy or 
consulate in the country you are living in.</p>

<p>If you do not attend the ceremony within 3 months without good reason, 
your application for citizenship will be refused.</p>

<p>At the ceremony, you will be asked to affirm or swear an oath of allegiance to Her 
Majesty the Queen and to pledge your loyalty to the UK. Following this you will be 
presented with your certificate of registration as a British citizen.</p>

<p>Making the Oath (or Affirmation) and Pledge at a citizenship ceremony is a legal
requirement, and the point at which you will become a British citizen.</p>

<p>Successful applicants are rarely exempted from ceremonies and then only if they are 
physically unable to attend or if their mental state would make it inappropriate to 
attend. If you wish to be exempted you should say why and provide supporting 
evidence.</p>
