<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>
<p>Counter proliferation is integral to the UK’s security and prosperity.  The Government’s approach to counter proliferation is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-britain-in-a-competitive-age-the-integrated-review-of-security-defence-development-and-foreign-policy">2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (IR)</a>. This highlights the Government’s vision for the UK’s role in the world over the next decade and the actions it will take to 2025. UK action is also underpinned by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/510716/National_Counter_Proliferation_Strategy_to_2020_-_updated_24_March.pdf">National Counter Proliferation Strategy (NCPS)</a>. The NCPS is under review and a revised version is due for publication in 2022. This programme aims to contribute towards delivery of IR and NCPS objectives.  Please refer to the Annex for more detail on our strategic priorities.</p>

<p>The counter-proliferation programme supports these goals by improving international implementation of the obligations set out in the major treaties, conventions and regimes which seek to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the illicit transfer of conventional weapons. A significant part of this effort will be assistance to countries – in taking the necessary steps to sign, ratify or join the counter proliferation treaties and regimes, and to develop national legislation and capacity to implement those obligations. Eligible projects must be multi-country, regional or global in scope.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Bids for projects must be submitted by 30 June 2022.</p>
</div>

<p>For Financial Year 2022 to 2023, the Programme Board will prioritise larger bids of approximately £100,000 to £300,000. It is highly recommended that potential applicants discuss project ideas with the Counter Proliferation and Arms Control Centre (CPACC) before preparing and submitting bids.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Programme budget</h3>
<p>It is mandatory that all programme activity is completed by the end of the UK financial year (31 March 2023). Budgets must profile detailed expenditure as accurately as possible to enable robust financial monitoring throughout the year. We are asking for full bids to be submitted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Programme Board</h3>
<p>The Programme Board is chaired by the Head of the Counter Proliferation and Arms Control Centre (CPACC) and formed of representatives from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Innovation (BEIS) within the Counter Proliferation and Arms Control Centre (CPACC).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Assessment Criteria</h3>
<p>Each project proposal will be considered in line with the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strategic alignment: all programmes and projects must align with FCDO/HMG strategic objectives and policy priorities.  Design clarity, coherence and clear benefit to the host countries or region and the UK: projects should be achievable within the financial year and demonstrate measurable impact, sustainability, and scalability</li>
  <li>resourcing: demonstrable adequate staffing throughout lifetime of project</li>
  <li>suitability: the implementer’s track-record, networks, and expertise. Where possible, projects should demonstrate additionality and build on wider capacity building activities, not simply duplicating efforts already being undertaken. Where implementers have previously received funding from this programme fund, new bids should summarise the outputs and impact of those projects, and should include copies of project completion reports</li>
  <li>due diligence assessment (DDA): successful implementers should be aware that a DDA will be undertaken internally by the FCDO prior to sanctioning any programme activity commencing with your organisation to satisfy risk and mitigation requirements. CPACC will engage with partners to identify risks and mitigations for projects to improve delivery. For implementers who have already been through this process, the DDA will be valid for three years from the date of the original assessment</li>
  <li>host government(s) or organisational support and engagement: evidence of wider stakeholder support and engagement is desirable. Jointly funded projects will be considered</li>
  <li>risk assessment: bids must contain a clear, detailed budget, aligned with activities that demonstrate value for money. Strong proposals will spread the cost of the project throughout the year, and avoid, where possible, storing activity towards the end of the financial year (January-March 2022)</li>
  <li>monitoring and evaluation: clear baselines and opportunities for beneficiary input, and transparent and robust processes in place</li>
  <li>Paris Agreement:  All programmes (and the projects, interventions or events within them) must align with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement" rel="external">Paris Agreement</a> - and assess climate and environmental impact and risks, taking steps to ensure that no environmental harm is done</li>
  <li>gender equality: projects and their objectives must either promote gender equality or not contribute to further gender inequality. In assessing proposals, policy leads will be required to make a statement explaining how gender equality issues have been considered and how delivery of project objectives will address these issues</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Risk analysis and management</h3>
<p>The Programme Board monitors spend throughout the year to manage any financial risk and uses progress reports from each project to monitor the risks both to projects and the overall programme. Projects should ensure that their bids include clear risk management, particularly risks with the potential to affect impact and the wider programme, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the risk of variable or reduced engagement of key stakeholders</li>
  <li>the risk of the project failing to complete in the current financial year</li>
  <li>the risk of any agreed outputs or objectives not being delivered</li>
  <li>the risk of underspend and overspend</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Programme monitoring and evaluation arrangements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>monthly updates on budgetary position: implementers will be required to provide FCDO policy leads with updated expenditure forecasts</li>
  <li>quarterly programme review: projects will be required to submit quarterly returns to the CPACC Programme Team to review. These will then feed into an overall quarterly programme review conducted by the Programme Manager</li>
  <li>end of Financial Year Review: Project completion reports will also be required for an end of financial year review of outcomes, outputs and initial impacts of the Programme’s funding</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Stakeholder management and communication</h2>

<ul>
  <li>bids should include a communications plan that demonstrates how communications will be used appropriately to engage stakeholders, help deliver the project’s objectives and project outputs</li>
  <li>project bids should be clear on who the principal stakeholders are for each project, how they have been engaged to date and plans to manage future engagement</li>
  <li>the project leads will work with the CPACC Communications Officer to ensure successes from the Programme are celebrated and publicised through a range of media</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Other issues and information</h2>
<p>Projects should be focused primarily on actions to encourage a state or states to adhere to norms on the possession and use of particular weapons, and to control access to materials and knowledge of proliferation concern, including through multi-country, regional or global projects. The Programme is not designed to fund projects to be undertaken within a single State. Single in-country proposals can only be funded by HMG representation within the target country providing they have the resources to do so.  Applicants wanting to develop single country bids may wish to contact CPACC for advice on making their bids to UK embassies.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that potential applicants discuss project ideas with the relevant policy leads in CPACC before submitting bids.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain who the relevant policy lead is or have any general questions about the programme or bidding process, please e-mail <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CounterProliferation.Programme@fcdo.gov.uk">CounterProliferation.Programme@fcdo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex: Counter Proliferation Programme strategic priorities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Relevant strategic and geographical priorities</h3>

<p>Effective counter proliferation helps to maintain regional and global stability, reduces threats to our citizens and armed forces, facilitates safe trade for our industry and protects high-skilled jobs across the UK.  Challenges faced in recent years have included Russia’s Salisbury attack and the attribution of chemical weapons use in Syria. These and the recent events in Ukraine demonstrate that counter proliferation is more important than ever.</p>

<p>We must also address growing threats from states such as Russia, Iran, China and North Korea; respond to emerging threats such as the illicit acquisition of advanced and dual-use technologies; and reinforce the global counter-proliferation architecture against growing pressures, shaping its future in our interest.</p>

<p>There are proliferation risks highlighted in the IR which may become even more likely and/or impactful over the longer-term:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is likely that a terrorist group will launch a successful CBRN attack by 2030.</li>
  <li>Proliferation of CBRN weapons, advanced conventional weapons and novel military technologies will</li>
</ol>

<p>increase the risk and intensity of conflict and pose significant challenges to strategic stability.</p>

<p>The Counter Terrorism Strategy 2018 (CONTEST) aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>detect and prevent terrorist access to use of materials of concern, knowledge and information that could be used to conduct attacks enhance capabilities to detect terrorist activity involving Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) material and their precursors and to control and safeguard these materials</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Programme design</h3>

<h4>2.1 Programme objectives and operating principles</h4>

<p>The programme looks to support activities that contribute to three aims, identified within the NCPS, which enable proliferation to flourish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>influencing intent: encouraging all states to adhere to norms on the possession and use of particular weapons, and to demonstrate the consequences of breaching those norms</li>
  <li>controlling access: controlling access to materials and knowledge globally to make it as hard as possible for states or terrorists to acquire or develop capabilities</li>
  <li>disrupting networks: disrupting illicit attempts to circumvent controls</li>
</ul>

<p>The programme funding is allocated to two elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>priority projects: a single bidding round each year</li>
  <li>support to international organisations: the programme also provides voluntary contributions in support of specific objectives covered by the programme. Such contributions are considered separately from the bidding process</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.2 Programme strategic goals and sub objectives breakdown</h4>

<p>Three broad themes for the FY 2022/23 programme are focused on ensuring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>counter-proliferation norms and treaties function effectively by enhancing efforts to uphold, preserve and strengthen the Rules Based International System</li>
  <li>states’ increased adherence to international security regimes and treaties; to promote UK values, influence and soft power to address shared proliferation challenges</li>
  <li>access control: control access to materials and knowledge globally to make it as hard as possible for states or terrorists to acquire or develop capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.3 Programme outcomes</h4>

<p>This table details specifically what policy outcomes are intended with specific areas on which potential programmes could focus.</p>
