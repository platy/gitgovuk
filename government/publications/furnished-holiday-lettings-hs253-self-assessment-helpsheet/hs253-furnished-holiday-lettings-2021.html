<p>There are special tax rules for rental income from properties that qualify as furnished holiday lettings (<abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr>).</p>

<p>If you let properties that qualify as <abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can claim Capital Gains Tax reliefs for traders (Business Asset Rollover Relief, Entrepreneurs’ Relief, relief for gifts of business assets and relief for loans to traders)</li>
  <li>you’re entitled to plant and machinery capital allowances for items such as furniture, equipment and fixtures</li>
  <li>the profits count as earnings for pension purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>To benefit from these rules, you need to work out the profit or loss from your <abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr> separately from any other rental business.</p>

<h2>Accommodation that qualifies as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>To qualify as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> your property must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the UK or in the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) – the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway</li>
  <li>furnished – there must be sufficient furniture provided for normal occupation and your visitors must be entitled to use the furniture</li>
</ul>

<p>The property must be commercially let (you must intend to make a profit). If you let the property out of season to cover costs but did not make a profit, the letting will still be treated as commercial.</p>

<p>All your <abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr> in the UK are taxed as a single UK <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business and all <abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr> in other <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> states are taxed as a single <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business. You will need to keep separate records for each <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business because the losses from one <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business cannot be used against profits of the other.</p>

<h2>Occupancy conditions</h2>

<p>Accommodation can only qualify as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> if it passes all 3 occupancy conditions.</p>

<h3>How to use the occupancy conditions</h3>

<p>For a continuing let, apply the tests to the tax year – that’s from 6 April one year, to 5 April the next year.</p>

<p>For a new let, apply the tests to the first 12 months from when the letting began.</p>

<p>When your letting stops, apply the tests to the 12 months up to when the letting finished.</p>

<h3>The pattern of occupation condition</h3>

<p>If the total of all lettings that exceed 31 continuous days is more than 155 days during the year, this condition is not met so your property will not be a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> for that year.</p>

<h3>The availability condition</h3>

<p>Your property must be available for letting as furnished holiday accommodation letting for at least 210 days in the year (140 days for the tax year 2011 to 2012 and earlier).</p>

<p>Do not count any days when you’re staying in the property. HMRC does not consider the property to be available for letting while you’re staying there.</p>

<h3>The letting condition</h3>

<p>You must let the property commercially as furnished holiday accommodation to the public for at least 105 days in the year (70 days for the tax year 2011 to 2012 and earlier).</p>

<p>Do not count any days when you let the property to friends or relatives at zero or reduced rates as this is not a commercial let.</p>

<p>Do not count longer-term lets of more than 31 days, unless the 31 days is exceeded because something unforeseen happens. For example, if the holidaymaker either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>falls ill or has an accident, and cannot leave on time</li>
  <li>has to extend their holiday due to a delayed flight</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not let your property for at least 105 days, you have 2 options (known as elections) that can help you reach the occupancy threshold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the averaging election – if you’ve more than one property</li>
  <li>a period of grace election – if your property reaches the occupancy threshold in some years but not in others</li>
</ul>

<h2>Averaging election</h2>

<p>If you let more than one property as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>, and one or more of these properties does not meet the letting condition of 105 days, you can elect to apply the letting condition to the average rate of occupancy for all the properties you let as <abbr title="furnished holiday lettings">FHLs</abbr>. This is called an averaging election.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Emma lets 4 UK holiday cottages in 2020 to 2021 for the following number of days:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Cottage</th>
      <th scope="col">Number of days</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cottage 1</td>
      <td>120 days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cottage 2</td>
      <td>125 days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cottage 3</td>
      <td>112 days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cottage 4</td>
      <td>64 days</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>421 days</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If Emma uses averaging, all 4 cottages will meet the letting condition (421 days divided by 4 = 105). Without averaging, cottage 4 would not qualify.</p>

<p>You can only average across properties in a single <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business.</p>

<p>You cannot mix UK and <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> properties together.</p>

<h3>Time limit</h3>

<p>You make an averaging election up to one year after 31 January following the end of the tax year. For example, if you’re filling in your tax return for 2020 to 2021, you must make your election by 31 January 2023.</p>

<h2>Period of grace election</h2>

<p>You may genuinely intend to meet the letting condition, but were unable to. If this happens, you may be able to make a period of grace election that allows the property to qualify as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> as long as the pattern of occupation and availability conditions were met.</p>

<p>To make an election, you must be able to show that you had a genuine intention to let the property in the year. For example, where you have marketed a property to the same or a greater level than in successful years, or where the lettings are cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances, including extreme adverse weather.</p>

<p>You can make an election where the property met the letting condition in the year before the first year you wish to make a period of grace election (either on its own or because of an averaging election). If your property again does not meet the letting condition in the following year, you can make a second period of grace election (as long as you made an election in the previous year).</p>

<p>If your property does not reach the threshold by the fourth year, after 2 consecutive period of grace elections, it will no longer qualify as a furnished holiday letting.</p>

<h3>How to make an election</h3>

<p>You can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use your Self Assessment ‘UK Property’ pages</li>
  <li>make it separately, up to one year after 31 January following the end of the tax year – for example, if you’re filling in your tax return for 2020 to 2021 you must make your election by 31 January 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using both averaging and period of grace</h2>

<p>If you have more than one property, you can use both averaging and period of grace elections to make sure that a property continues to qualify as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Emma has 4 cottages that she lets as furnished holiday lettings. In some years cottage 3 does not meet the letting condition.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Year 1</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 2</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 3</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 4</th>
      <th scope="col">Year 5</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Cottage 1</th>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Cottage 2</th>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Cottage 3</th>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Averaging</td>
      <td>Period of grace</td>
      <td>Period of grace</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Cottage 4</th>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
      <td>Qualifies</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Emma uses averaging in year 2 and period of grace in year 3 and 4 to make sure that cottage 3 qualifies for the whole period.</p>

<h2>Property closed for part of the year or only part of the property let</h2>

<p>If your property is only used as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> and is closed for part of the year because there are no customers, you can deduct all the expenses, such as insurance and loan interest, for the whole year, provided you do not live in the property.</p>

<p>If you let part of the property as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>, or where you use the property privately for part of the year, you need to apportion your receipts and expenses on a reasonable basis.</p>

<h2>Property stops being a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Your property will no longer be a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> if the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>property is:
    <ul>
      <li>sold</li>
      <li>used for private occupation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>letting condition is not met even with the averaging and period of grace elections</li>
</ul>

<p>If your property does not qualify as a <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> or stops being a qualifying <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr>, the special tax treatment will no longer apply. You’ll need to work out any balancing allowance or balancing charge for capital allowances, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capital-allowances-and-balancing-charges-hs252-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 252 Capital allowances and balancing charges</a> and if any Capital Gains Tax reliefs will be affected, read:</p>

<h2>What you can do with losses</h2>

<p>If your UK <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business makes a loss, you can set the loss against your UK <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> profits of later years. Similarly, if your <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business makes a loss, you can set the loss against your <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> profits of later years. You cannot set the losses of one <abbr title="furnished holiday letting">FHL</abbr> business against the profits of the other if you’ve a UK and an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> business.</p>
