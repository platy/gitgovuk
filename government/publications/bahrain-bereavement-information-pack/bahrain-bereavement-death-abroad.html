<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The information contained in this document is not meant to be a definitive statement of the law, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The death of a relative or a friend can be a traumatic experience. When the death occurs overseas, family and friends in the UK can feel additional distress as they are unfamiliar with foreign procedures and perhaps are unable to communicate in the language of the country where the death occurred. Consular Directorate of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office and our Embassy in Bahrain are ready to help as far as they can. You may be uncertain about what to do next or who to contact for advice. These notes are designed to help you through the practical arrangements you will need to make. You should be aware that Bahrain procedures may differ to those in the United Kingdom and that, while we understand your need for arrangements to be made quickly, this is not always possible.</p>

<h2>Summary of procedures</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Collect the death certificate and notification of cause of death from the hospital where the deceased has died. Only the next of kin is able to do this or a person acting on the instructions of the next of kin e.g. funeral directors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the death certificate and notification of death to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for attestation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the deceased was a resident, the employer/sponsor needs to cancel the residence visa at Immigration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take the attested death certificate, notification of cause of death (stamped by the MFA), the cancelled visa and original passport to the Embassy for a letter of no objection for repatriation or for burial or cremation (No Objection Certificate). If the deceased had more than one passport then all passports should be presented.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A consent form can be completed by the next of kin to authorise a third party to deal with all documentation and procedures from here on. This will also need to be presented to the Embassy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The passport can be cancelled at this point if the family member is ready for this and can be returned immediately to the next of kin. If this feels too traumatic, it can be cancelled at a later date.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Return of personal effects</h2>

<p>The British Embassy in Bahrain cannot be responsible for collecting or returning personal belongings of the deceased.</p>

<p>Any personal belongings of the deceased can only be returned to the next of kin upon completion of police enquiries and all local procedures.</p>

<p>Personal belongings are usually transported to next of kin/families via local agents or commercial courier companies if the family does not travel to Bahrain to collect the belongings themselves.</p>

<p>Most courier/shipping companies will transport household goods, clothing and similar property.</p>

<h2>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>The large mortuary is situated at Salmaniya Hospital in Manama and there is a smaller one in the Bahrain Defence Forces Hospital at Riffa. The standards applied, for example in relation to storage temperature, are on a par with UK morgues.</p>

<h2>Repatriation and burial</h2>

<p>A body can be released once the No Objection Certificate has been issued which can be within a day.</p>

<p>Burial is an option in Bahrain and this can be arranged by one of the churches. If a local burial or cremation takes place, there will be no inquest carried out in the UK. If your wish would be to bury your loved one at St Christopherâs Cathedral, then please contact Fozia on +973 36533560 who will be able to assist you.</p>

<p>There are cremations carried out in Askhar but very rarely with British Nationals as it can be very upsetting. The body is taken from the coffin and wrapped in a shroud. This is then carried to the funeral pyre by the male relatives. While doing this the pyre is circled three times anti-clockwise. This is usually done by the male relatives of the family, lead by the chief mourner (senior male next of kin). You will be able to arrange flowers and a religious advocate (priest/vicar etc) to preside over the ceremony. A day later the next of kin will be able to collect the ashes. Please note that the ashes may not be the same as what you would be used to in the UK. If your wish is to return the ashes to the UK you can do this either via cargo or hand luggage but must get approval from the airline and immigration.</p>

<p>Any Bahraini cargo company will deal with repatriation of bodies and further advice can be obtained from the Consular Section at the British Embassy. Repatriations can normally take place within 7 â 10 days.</p>

<h2>Registration of the death</h2>

<p>A local death certificate, citing the cause of death, will be issued within a day or two of death. This carries a statutory fee which is payable in Bahrain Dinars.</p>

<h2>Clearing Agents/Funeral Directors</h2>

<p>You can instruct a clearing agent to arrange all the above if you feel unable to. A list of clearing agents can be found at the following link <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bahrain-list-of-funeral-directors">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bahrain-list-of-funeral-directors</a>.</p>

<h2>Police/Judicial inquiries</h2>

<p>In the case of suspicious death or a road traffic accident, CID will lead an investigation and, once the report is prepared, it is passed to the Public Prosecution. The victimâs family are entitled to a copy of the report. Public Prosecution will decide if autopsy is required for the investigation.</p>

<h2>Legal Aid</h2>

<p>Legal aid is not available in Bahrain.</p>

<h2>Autopsies (Post Mortems)</h2>

<p>Autopsies are only carried out if the cause of death is suspicious and organs are not permitted to be removed in any Islamic country (only in suspicious causes of death, i.e. murder). Organ transplants are not available in Bahrain.</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>There are no formal government compensation schemes available. If a case goes to court it depends on the judgeâs decision.</p>

<h2>To register a death overseas</h2>

<p>Use this link to register the death and receive copies of the death registration certificate if required:

<h2>Further Information</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office has produced booklets for families, which are available online: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad</a>. It contains guidance is on death overseas and what practical support consular staff can offer you and what you need to do. Laws and local custom vary widely from country to country. This guidance is therefore necessarily general.</p>

<h3>COVID related deaths</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Health have directed that deaths from COVID are unable to be repatriated and the only option available would be a local burial or cremation. You will still be able to repatriate the ashes following a cremation.</p>
