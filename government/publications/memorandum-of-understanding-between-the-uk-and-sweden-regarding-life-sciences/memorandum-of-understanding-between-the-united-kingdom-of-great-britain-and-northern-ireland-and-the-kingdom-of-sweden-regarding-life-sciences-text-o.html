<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the ‘United Kingdom’) and the Kingdom of Sweden (‘Sweden’) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Participants’):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>acknowledging their existing bilateral cooperation in the field of life sciences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>desiring to strengthen bilateral cooperation to create long-term relations in the area of life sciences with the common goal of supporting implementation of the United Kingdom’s life sciences vision and Sweden’s national life sciences strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recognising the importance of a range of actors to a vibrant and dynamic life sciences sector, including enterprises, higher education institutions, non-profit organisations, and the public sector (including research and innovation funders)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recognising the potential for the United Kingdom and Sweden’s life sciences sectors to tackle shared international health challenges</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>have reached the following understanding on areas for future bilateral cooperation:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Purpose</h2>

<p>1.1  The purpose of this memorandum of understanding (<abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr>) is to promote cooperation between the participants across local, regional and national healthcare, research and innovation systems in support of the development of dynamic, effective and attractive life science ecosystems. Cooperation between the participants will take place on the principles of equality, reciprocity, mutual benefit, and within the framework of all applicable laws and relevant institutions of both countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Areas of cooperation</h2>

<p>2.1 The participants will continue to pursue opportunities that advances in medical technologies and techniques enable to benefit health outcomes in their countries and globally, building on areas of excellence on both sides. The participants intend that early areas of cooperation may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early diagnostics</li>
  <li>genomics</li>
  <li>clinical trials</li>
  <li>regulatory innovation</li>
  <li>implementation of innovation</li>
  <li>manufacturing processes</li>
  <li>sustainability in the life sciences sector</li>
  <li>antimicrobial resistance</li>
</ul>

<p>2.2 Cooperative activities to support exchange on these topics may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collaboration in policy, design and implementation of technical standards necessary to build data driven approaches in the life sciences sector</li>
  <li>knowledge exchange in policies, strategies and market interventions</li>
  <li>cooperation in the development of policy initiatives to stimulate an active marketplace through enterprise engagement and collaborative initiatives</li>
  <li>cooperation in the research, development, evaluation and implementation of new technologies and treatments</li>
</ul>

<p>2.3  The United Kingdom and Sweden are recognised international leaders in driving efforts to address the ‘silent pandemic’ of antimicrobial resistance and will continue to work closely bilaterally and multilaterally to accelerate cross-sectoral action on <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>. The countries will cooperate on research and development for novel antimicrobial treatments, preventatives and diagnostics, and sharing best practice to ensure their access and responsible stewardship. The United Kingdom and Sweden will also work together to encourage sustainable antimicrobial supply chains, supporting measures to tackle environmental drivers on <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.4 Recognising the importance of a strong science base to innovation in life sciences, the participants welcome existing research cooperation between the United Kingdom and Sweden through collaborations between businesses, higher education institutions, health and research institutions and other actors. The participants encourage researchers from both nations to continue to work closely together, including through multilateral projects and joint applications to European research and innovation programmes.</p>

<p>2.5  The United Kingdom and Sweden have a long-standing trade and investment relationship and as global leaders in life sciences, there is the opportunity to strengthen this further through business development and collaborative opportunities. In particular, supporting innovative small and medium-sized enterprises in both countries has the potential to create new jobs, expand trade and stimulate economic growth. The participants will support further cooperation through the exploration of opportunities in each market and developing a shared understanding of any barriers to trade and investment. This may include specific therapeutic areas or best practice of, for example, clinical trials. They may also foster closer ties by promoting partnership projects between United Kingdom’s and Swedish companies, and facilitating exchanges of business missions.</p>

<p>2.6  There is an opportunity for the participants to collaborate and utilise their life science expertise in the area of pandemic preparedness, for example through implementation of the 100 Days Mission, a global public-private ambition to harness scientific innovation to have safe and effective diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines (DTVs) ready to be deployed within the first 100 days of a future pandemic threat being identified.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Implementation</h2>

<p>3.1  A joint working group comprising of representatives of the participants will be formed to take forward implementation of this <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr>, meeting at least every 6months and reporting in to the heads of the United Kingdom Office for Life Sciences and Swedish Office of Life Science or equivalent. The heads of the United Kingdom Office for Life Sciences and Swedish Office of Life Science will hold annual meetings to consider progress under this <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> and exchange best practice in their respective roles to support the delivery of life sciences and innovation policy in each country.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> General provisions</h2>

<p>4.1  This <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> is not legally binding and it does not create any legal or financial obligations for the participants. Any program or project requiring financial contributions from either side will be subject to separate arrangements. This <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> will be carried out within the framework of the existing laws and regulations of the 2 countries.</p>

<p>4.2  Any differences arising in relation to the interpretation or implementation of this <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> will be resolved amicably through consultations or negotiations between the participants.</p>

<p>4.3 This <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> will come into effect upon its signature by both participants and will remain in effect for a period of 5 years. Thereafter it will automatically terminate unless otherwise decided between the participants.</p>

<p>4.4  This <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> may be amended by mutual written consent of both participants.</p>

<p>4.5  Notwithstanding paragraph [4.3], this <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> may be terminated by either side upon 90 days’ written notice to the other Side.</p>

<p>4.6  The termination of this <abbr title="memorandum of understanding">MoU</abbr> will not affect any prior commitment, or any project or activity already in progress at the time of termination.</p>
