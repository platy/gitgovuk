<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK government is rolling out a coronavirus testing programme, which is made up of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing frontline workers and seriously ill patients</li>
  <li>testing to see if you currently have coronavirus</li>
  <li>testing to see if you have coronavirus antibodies</li>
  <li>monitoring the spread and development of coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<p>This notice focuses on home antibody testing for coronavirus. An antibody test is a blood test to check if you’ve had coronavirus (COVID-19) before or been vaccinated.</p>

<p>The antibody test is also being offered as part of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing journey. If you receive a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, you can choose to take an antibody test.</p>

<p>Your blood test is analysed in a laboratory.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-tests" class="govuk-link">Find out more about antibody testing</a>.</p>

<p>More details on the test can also be found in annex 1 below.</p>

<p>The test is completely voluntary. You can choose not to complete the test at any point, but are encouraged to take it if you have been invited to order a test kit. If you do take the test, please carefully follow the instructions provided.</p>

<p>An antibody test can tell you if it’s likely you’ve had coronavirus before or been vaccinated. But it does not work for everyone, as some people who’ve had the virus do not have antibodies. An antibody test does not tell you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you’re immune to coronavirus</li>
  <li>if you can or cannot spread the virus to other people</li>
</ul>

<p>The test kit comes with instructions on how to use it. Once you have taken the test, your sample will be analysed in a laboratory and you will be informed of the result (positive, negative or failed). If you get a positive antibody test result (indicating you have coronavirus antibodies), you will still need to follow the same social distancing advice as everyone else.</p>

<p>You will be given advice on any next steps that you should take following your result.</p>

<p>The purpose of the testing and associated data collection is:</p>

<p>1) Operational:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to be able to deliver the testing service</li>
  <li>to monitor and improve the delivery of the testing service</li>
</ul>

<p>2) Personal health information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to inform the individual of their antibody status</li>
  <li>to add the antibody test result to the GP record</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Pandemic response:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to inform policy in response to the pandemic</li>
  <li>to inform the operational response to the pandemic (for example, local outbreaks)</li>
  <li>to share the data for research</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data controller</h2>

<p>The overall testing programme has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). DHSC decides what information is required and how it needs to be used.</p>

<p>DHSC has commissioned the COVID-19 testing programme on behalf of the UK and will be data controller for the purposes of Data Protection legislation. Once the test results have been collated DHSC will remain the controller for the data of English residents. The governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland may have also requested (under section 255 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012) that NHS Digital collate relevant test results data for their residents, to be sent to a named organisation in their country to help their response to coronavirus (Public Health Wales, NHS National Services Scotland and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland), who will be the controllers of their respective data.</p>

<p>Other organisations will also carry out parts of the COVID-19 testing programme on behalf of DHSC, but can only act on instructions provided to them by DHSC. These organisations are known as data processors.</p>

<p>Each organisation will require a different level of information about you, but all will use the minimum necessary to do what they are required to by the controller.</p>

<h2>What personal data we collect</h2>

<p>If you request your antibody test on the GOV.UK website or are volunteering to take an antibody test after a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, the following information is required in order to register and receive a home testing kit.</p>

<p>The details we may need from you include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identity (name, date of birth, sex)</li>
  <li>other personal details (postcode, ethnicity)</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is necessary in order to link the test result to the subject’s GP record, and also to enable meaningful research and analysis</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact details (mobile phone number, email address)</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is necessary to send out test kits and provide results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you, or anyone you live with, has tested positive for coronavirus before</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is necessary to support research and analysis into which groups are vulnerable, and how the virus has spread.</p>

<ul>
  <li>occupation details</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is necessary as the eligibility for the test will focus on different groups depending on the research or surveillance project. Certain sectors appear to be at a higher risk (for example, meat processing), and any vulnerability could have consequences in outbreak management (for example, schools).</p>

<h2>How we use your information in the testing programme</h2>

<p>For laboratory-based, after following the instructions provided, you will need to post your testing kit to a laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>The laboratory will analyse the sample and provide your test result to National Pathology Exchange (<abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr>). The lab does not receive any information that would allow them to personally identify you. They only get a Specimen ID from the test kit, and then they attach the result to that Specimen ID.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr> will link your registration record with your test result and pass this information onto NHS Business Services Authority, who will inform you of your result by text and/or email. <abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr> will also send results to NHS Digital (see annex 2 below), so they can collate data and information.</p>

<h2>Purposes your data will be used for</h2>

<p>A positive antibody test will not confer any privileges, certifications or exemptions from existing HM Government or devolved administration COVID-19 guidelines. You must still self-isolate in line with guidelines if you either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>come into contact with somebody who has COVID-19</li>
  <li>test positive for COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>DHSC is the data controller for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirming your request for a test</li>
  <li>receiving and processing your test request (to send you your test kit)</li>
  <li>confirming your results to you</li>
  <li>undertaking quality assurance of the testing process (for example, clinical process assurance)</li>
  <li>analysis to support operational decisions to improve the full end-to-end testing process, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>day-to-day operational use (for example, whether someone returned their test kit)</li>
      <li>to inform test process improvements (for example, manage kit delivery times)</li>
      <li>support logistics planning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for residents in England, sharing your results with NHS Digital to analyse data in relation to coronavirus.</li>
  <li>sharing results with Public Health England to help plan and respond to coronavirus</li>
  <li>to invite you to engage with other services/programmes (for example, vaccination programmes, research trials)</li>
  <li>DHSC’s own research and analysis in order to inform public policy and response</li>
  <li>to add the antibody test result to your GP record</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data processors and other recipients of your data</h2>

<p>Organisations who use your data and information on behalf of a controller can only do so with clear instructions from the controller, and cannot use your data and information for any other purpose. Any use of information that is not covered by the instructions from the controller would be unlawful, unless the controller agrees and provides written permission to do this.</p>

<p>DHSC has appointed data processors to carry out the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration, and capture of information at the point of ordering a home test</li>
  <li>verify your identity. We may use an agency, who will check your identity (this is not a credit check and does not affect your credit score)</li>
  <li>overseeing the logistics of test kit deliveries</li>
  <li>transporting and delivering kits</li>
  <li>link your personal details (provided on registering for the test) to the test result</li>
  <li>forward your test results, email address and phone number to NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) to send you your test results.</li>
  <li>receive data to enable your results to be communicated back to you by SMS (text) and email, along with supporting information</li>
</ul>

<p>Services on behalf of DHSC may be provided by different organisations in different regions and a full list of data processors can be found in annex 2 below.</p>

<p>We may need to share your personal data if we are required to do so by law.</p>

<h2>Data retention</h2>

<p>Your information will be stored in line with the Records Management Code of Practice for Health and Social Care 2016. This means we will keep your information for up to 8 years before we dispose of it.</p>

<h2>Data storage</h2>

<p>Information that identifies you will be stored securely, and processed in, the UK and Ireland. Information that does not, and cannot, identify you may be stored and processed outside of this area (for example, information purely about the number of tests conducted, or the number of outcomes from tests).</p>

<h2>Legal basis under <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018</h2>

<p>DHSC’s legal basis for processing your personal data is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 6 (1) (e) – the processing is necessary for the performance of its official tasks carried out in the public interest in providing and managing a health service</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 9 (2) (h) – the processing is necessary for the management of health/social care systems or services
    <ul>
      <li>
<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, (2) (2) (f)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> Article 9 (2) (i) – the processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health
    <ul>
      <li>
<abbr title="Data Protection Act">DPA</abbr> 2018 – Schedule 1, Part 1, (3) – Health or social care purposes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Your rights as a data subject</h2>

<p>By law, you have a number of rights as a data subject and this testing programme does not take away or reduce these rights.</p>

<p>These rights are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your right to get copies of your information – you have the right to ask for a copy of any information about you that is used.</li>
  <li>Your right to get your information corrected – you have the right to ask for any information held about you that you think is inaccurate, to be corrected</li>
  <li>Your right to limit how your information is used – you have the right to ask for any of the information held about you to be restricted, for example, if you think inaccurate information is being used.</li>
  <li>Your right to object to your information being used – You can ask for any information held about you to not be used. However, this is not an absolute right, and we may need to continue using your information, and we will tell you if this is the case.</li>
  <li>Your right to get information deleted – This is not an absolute right, and we may need to continue to use your information, and we will tell you if this is the case.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data Protection Officer for the Department of Health and Social Care.</p>

<p>If you are unhappy or wish to complain about how your personal data is used as part of this programme, you should contact DHSC in the first instance to resolve your issue. DHSC may have to work with partner organisations to resolve your complaint.</p>

<p>If you are still not satisfied, you can complain to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner’s Office</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: types of antibody tests</h2>

<p>There are different types of antibody tests to check if you have had the virus or been vaccinated. Make sure you check the message you receive to help you understand what your result means.</p>

<p>This test requires a sample of blood. This test can be conducted at home (or other non-hospital environment) and requires you to take your own sample of blood.</p>

<p>The home test kit contains all you need to take your test at home, as well as instructions on how to take the test.</p>

<p>This sample is then sent to a pathology laboratory for analysis. Once the results are known, you will be informed of the result.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> Test</h3>

<p>This test can be conducted at home (or other non-hospital environment) and requires you to take your own sample of blood. The home test kit contains all you need to take your test at home, as well as instructions on how to take the test.</p>

<p>This sample is then sent to a pathology laboratory for analysis.  Once the results are known, you will be informed of the result.</p>

<h2>Annex 2: list of data processors</h2>

<p>Each organisation that processes your information must provide you with information about how they do this, and this information will be limited to their role in the test programme. This should be publicly available on their website or can be requested from them. For example, if you want to know more about how NHS Digital uses your information, then you can visit their website.</p>

<p>Data processors can only act upon written instruction from a data controller, they cannot use data and information without permission of the data controller.</p>
