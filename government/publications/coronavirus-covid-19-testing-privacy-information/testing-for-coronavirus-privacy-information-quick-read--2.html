<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The government has rolled out a coronavirus (COVID-19) testing programme, and you have chosen to take a test. This test will confirm if you currently have coronavirus.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/antigen/name">register for a test online</a>.</p>

<p>If you have difficulties accessing the online system, you can register for a test by calling 119 from England, Northern Ireland and Wales or 0300 303 2713 from Scotland.</p>

<p>The test will confirm whether you currently have COVID-19. You will be sent a text message and/or an email with your test result. The result of the test will enable you or other members in your household to know what action to take depending on your result (for example, to continue to self-isolate or possibly to return to work).</p>

<p>This test should not be used for the purpose of international travel. You can purchase a private test if required. This is to ensure that those requiring a test have access to one.</p>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be contacted a few weeks after the date of your result to be invited to take an antibody test. This test is also voluntary, and you do not have to take it. If you do decide to take an antibody test, you will be invited to register for a test that is similar to this one – please follow the instructions given to you when you register.</p>

<p>If you test positive, you may also be contacted via email or text message to see if you wish to donate blood plasma as part of the potential treatment for coronavirus.</p>

<p>If you test positive or negative, you may also be contacted via text message to see if you wish to contribute to the research effort of COVID-19 If you are interested in doing this, you need to follow the link in the text message.</p>

<p>You must inform your employer if you test positive for COVID-19, because they will need to take action to support you and manage any impact on the organisation (such as inviting others you work closely with to be tested). If there is reasonable evidence that you contracted COVID-19 from a work-related exposure your employer is obliged to report this to the Health and Safety Executive, as required by the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (<abbr title="Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995">RIDDOR</abbr>).</p>

<p>The test is completely voluntary. You can cancel the test that you’ve booked if you no longer need it. If you do decide to take a test, then you need to follow the instructions provided. As part of the registration process, we will send you a confirmation email with the details of your order or booking. If you are attending a test site, it is necessary to bring this with you.</p>

<p>Please note that if you access our service using your NHS login details, the identity verification services are managed by NHS Digital. See <a href="https://access.login.nhs.uk/terms-and-conditions" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Login’s Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions</a>. This restriction does not apply to the personal information you provide to us separately.</p>

<p>For more detailed information regarding the testing programme, or for details of who is processing data on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, please use the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested">getting tested</a>.</p>

<h2>Data controller</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) has commissioned the COVID-19 testing programme on behalf of the UK and will be data controller for the purposes of Data Protection legislation. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> decides what information is required and how it needs to be used.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> are consulting and involving the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments, who may have their own testing processes specific to their area (along with country-specific information relating to COVID-19). Links to this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#residentsinwalesscotlandandnorthernireland">Residents in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</a> section.</p>

<p>NHS Digital is the controller for any personal information you provided to NHS Digital to get an NHS login account and verify your identity, and uses that personal information solely for that single purpose. For this personal information, our role is a “processor” only and we must act under the instructions provided by NHS Digital (as the “controller”) when verifying your identity.</p>

<h2>What personal data we collect</h2>

<p>The details we may need from you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first and last name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnicity</li>
  <li>landline and mobile phone number</li>
  <li>email address</li>
  <li>home and delivery address, including postcode</li>
  <li>vehicle registration number</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
  <li>NHS number (for English residents and if you know it. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland residents may need to provide a different local identifier, which will be specified upon registering for a test)</li>
  <li>details and date of onset of symptoms</li>
  <li>vaccination status</li>
  <li>your NHS login account identifier (if you access our services using your NHS login details)</li>
  <li>recent travel history (for example, whether you travelled overseas in the last 14 days and the country you spent most time in)</li>
  <li>employer details</li>
  <li>other household members’ details, if you are ordering or booking a test for them as well</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have registered for a home test or have been sent out because you’re in an outbreak area, then your name and address will be passed to Amazon, who will deliver the testing kit. The kit will have a unique reference number. Once you have self-administered the test, you will need to follow the instructions on the kit. Completed test kits will be collected by a courier or need to be posted via a priority post box and delivered to a laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>If you have registered for an appointment at the regional test site, you will receive a QR code which will be scanned when you arrive at the site to check you should be there. When you take the test, you will need to register the kit barcode to you before returning it. Completed tests will then be sent to the laboratory for analysis.</p>

<p>The laboratory will analyse the sample and provide your test result to <abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr>. The lab does not receive any of your personal data, only the specimen ID from the test kit and the lab attaches the result to the specimen ID.</p>

<p><abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr> will link your registration record with your test result and pass this information onto NHS Business Services Authority, who will inform you of your result by text and/or email. <abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr> will also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send results to NHS Digital, so they can collate data and information for each of the UK countries</li>
  <li>link the result to your GP record (for English residents), by receiving your GP details from NHS Digital or Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and using a product called Keystone (provided by EMIS Health) to send results to your GP. Where <abbr title="National Pathology Exchange">NPEx</abbr> can’t match the record, NHS Digital will try to. This will enable your GP to be informed of your test result without you needing to do anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish residents, your results will be returned to Public Health Wales, NHS National Services Scotland and Northern Ireland public health bodies respectively, enabling them to respond to COVID-19.</p>

<p>After your COVID-19 test, we will also collect and process your test results (positive, negative or unclear), so we can inform you of your result and what steps you should take next.</p>

<p>You must self-isolate to stop the virus from spreading. Self-isolate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have any symptoms of coronavirus (a high temperature, a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste)</li>
  <li>test positive for COVID-19 or are a close contact of someone who tests positive</li>
  <li>live with someone who has symptoms or tested positive</li>
  <li>find out that someone in your support bubble has symptoms or tested positive</li>
  <li>are told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app</li>
  <li>arrive in the UK from a country with a high coronavirus risk – check guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk">how to self-isolate when you travel to the UK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have been instructed to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, we will regularly contact you by phone and text during this period to provide advice and support and check you are self-isolating.</p>

<p>If we try to call you but receive no response after 3 attempts or you tell us you are not self-isolating, the following data may be passed to your local authority.</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>address at which you are self-isolating</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
  <li>information about when you were instructed to self-isolate</li>
</ul>

<p>Your local authority will investigate further to find out if you need support with self-isolating or have a reasonable excuse not to self-isolate. Reasonable excuses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seeking medical assistance</li>
  <li>obtaining basic necessities such as food or medicine if there is no other way to obtain them,</li>
  <li>accessing social services or other important public services</li>
  <li>avoiding a risk of harm</li>
  <li>attending the funeral of a close family member</li>
  <li>carrying out a legal obligation such as attending court</li>
  <li>or accessing veterinary services</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police forces to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined.</p>

<p>A police force may request information relating to your isolation status from the NHS Test and Trace programme directly, where they are investigating a report of someone who may not be complying with the mandatory self-isolation period.</p>

<p>If you test positive for COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may be contacted by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> a few weeks after the date of your result to be invited to take an antibody test. This test is also voluntary, and you do not have to take it. If you do decide to take an antibody test, you will be invited to register for a test that is similar to this one – please follow the instructions given to you when you register</li>
  <li>you may also be contacted by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> via email or text message to see if you wish to donate blood plasma as part of the potential treatment for coronavirus</li>
  <li>your information will be passed to contact tracing</li>
</ul>

<p>If you test positive or negative, you may also be contacted by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to see if you wish to contribute to the research effort of COVID-19. If you are interested in doing this, you need to follow the link in the text message.</p>

<h2>Purposes your data will be used for</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is the data controller for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirming the appointment to the test site</li>
  <li>performing a QR code check at the test site</li>
  <li>receiving and processing your test</li>
  <li>returning your results to you</li>
  <li>contacting you (if you test positive) as part of the government contact tracing programme</li>
  <li>sharing your results with Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish health bodies (if you live in that country) to inform local planning and responses to COVID-19</li>
  <li>sharing results with Public Health England (if you live in England) to help plan and respond to COVID-19</li>
  <li>sharing your vaccination status with Public Health England (if you live in England) to understand the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including their effectiveness against different strains of the COVID-19 virus, and, where appropriate, to ask you to do a repeat test and/or an antibody test</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with your local authority (if you live in England) to verify any application you may have made for a self-isolation support payment</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with your local authority (if you live in England), to enable them to provide support and guidance to you if you are self-isolating. If there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined. Local authorities may also share data with third-party organisations such as charities for support purposes</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with relevant police forces to support mandated self-isolation periods and any enforcement action that may result (if you live in England)</li>
  <li>sharing your COVID-19 test result with your local hospital, if you are booked in for elective surgery (via your Summary Care Record). This only applies if you have taken a test and you have a Summary Care Record</li>
  <li>sharing your results with NHS Digital to analyse data in relation to COVID-19 (for residents in England)</li>
  <li>undertaking quality assurance of the testing process (for example, clinical process assurance)</li>
  <li>instructing the data processors to share data for research purposes. The data processor will have appropriate data security to manage this data</li>
  <li>for analysis to support operational decisions to improve the full end-to-end testing process such as:
    <ul>
      <li>day-to-day use (for example, whether someone attended their appointment)</li>
      <li>to inform regional test sites of improvements to the testing process (for example, manage capacity or throughput)</li>
      <li>to support end-to-end logistics planning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Your information used for other purposes</h2>

<p>Your information may also be used for different purposes that are not directly related to your health and care. Wherever possible, this will be done using information that does not identify you (anonymous data). These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>research into COVID-19 (including potentially being invited to a research project)</li>
  <li>service evaluation of new COVID-19 diagnostic products</li>
  <li>planning of services and actions in response to COVID-19</li>
  <li>monitoring the progress and development of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>Information provided by you, and collected about you, in relation to testing for COVID-19 will not be used for any purpose that is not linked to controlling the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>There may be times when it is necessary for your personal data to be used. Any release of information that could identify you will be lawful and the minimum necessary for that purpose.</p>

<p>If you live in England or Wales, your permission is not always required for your data to be used to contact you to ask if you would like to participate in health research. For example, the law permits this to happen where it is approved by the Secretary of State or the Health Research Authority so that approved medical research can take place. You may therefore still be invited to participate in coronavirus vaccine studies without your permission where the law allows this, but this does not mean that you have to participate.</p>

<p>If you live in Northern Ireland or Scotland you can find links to this information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information/testing-for-coronavirus-privacy-information-quick-read#residentsinwalesscotlandandnorthernireland">residents in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland</a> section.</p>

<h2>Data processors and other recipients of your data</h2>

<p>Organisations who use your data and information on behalf of a controller, can only do so with clear instructions from the controller and cannot use your data and information for any other purpose. Any use of information that is not covered by the instructions from the controller would be unlawful, unless the controller agrees and provides written permission to do this. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> have appointed data processors to carry out the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration of your test</li>
  <li>to schedule appointments and capture information at the point of testing</li>

<h2>Data Protection Officer</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s Data Protection Officer is Lee Cramp and can be contacted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:data_protection@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">data_protection@dhsc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Care home testing</h2>

<p>Testing has been rolled out to care homes and other similar residences, such as residential homes and hospices with associated community services (for example, Hospice at Home). This also includes children’s homes run by local authorities.</p>

<p>If you’re a resident in a care home, you will be tested where you live. This will be done in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the manager of the home will register on GOV.UK via a unique care home portal for the number of home test kits they need for their residents and staff, then register each person individually (so the test kit number can be linked to your details). The staff of the home will administer the tests and they will be collected by courier from the home and sent for analysis.</li>
  <li>the home will be visited by a mobile testing unit that can test all residents and staff present on the day</li>
</ul>

<p>If a testing unit visits your home, they will provide you with instructions and assistance in taking the test, and test kits provided to your home will come with instructions for the staff in how to administer the test.</p>

<p>Once the test has been taken, your sample will be sent off for analysis, and the result will be sent back to you and/or the manager. This is because the manager will need to take action if you test positive, such as moving you to a different part of the home to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other residents or staff.</p>

<p>If someone has been legally appointed to manage your affairs (such as someone with Power of Attorney status for you), they will also be informed of the result (although this does not apply for Power of Attorneys who have been appointed to manage your financial affairs only).</p>

<p>If you’re a resident in England, your result will also be sent to your GP so they are aware and can plan what care you need.</p>

<p>For staff who work in this area, you will also be eligible for testing and this could be done either by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a mobile testing unit (if they visit on a day you work)</li>
  <li>the manager of the home requests a test kit for you (see above – the manager may register staff individually once test kits arrive, and must input your contact number and email address)</li>
  <li>self-registering for a test</li>
</ul>

<p>Your result will be sent to you (with information about next steps) and not to the manager of the home. You must inform the manager if the result is positive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>because you’ll need to self-isolate and spend time away from work</li>
  <li>in order to ensure the safety of other staff and residents</li>
  <li>to manage the home</li>
</ul>

<p>If you live in England, your result will also be sent to your GP to update your medical records.</p>

<h2>Self-reporting</h2>

<p>This allows the test subject to register their details, the test kit ID number, the care home unique organisation number and report on their result. The individual taking the test and their role in the test process will be captured (resident, staff or visitor). This is self-asserted and from a technology and privacy perspective, there is nothing additional to the data collected to existing Registration Lite services. The only data point that is captured in this service, that is not asked for in Registration Lite, is the self-asserted result (positive, negative or invalid).</p>

<p>There are slight changes to data flows and the front-end data capture. The service uses the same underlying infrastructure as the existing Registration Lite journey and has the capability to flow down into the various downstream systems used by Registration Lite. However, data will not flow down into GP records or contact tracing. Data will flow down into EDGE so that it can be accessed for <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> reporting purposes and data will also go via BSA to send a confirmatory communication (SMS or email) to the subject with the result they have reported.</p>

<h2>Cohort pooling</h2>

<p>Cohort pooling presents a major opportunity for the UK National Testing Programme as it can significantly increase testing capacity with minimal additional capital investment or disruption to existing lab processes, while simultaneously reducing reagent consumption per test.</p>

<p>Sample pooling is a method which can be applied to testing processes to increase throughput.</p>

<p>Pooling involves aggregating multiple individual samples into a single pool which is tested using the same <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> methodology.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr>, also known as a real-time polymerase chain reaction, is a laboratory technique of molecular biology based on the polymerase chain reaction. It monitors the amplification of a targeted DNA molecule during the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, not at its end, as in conventional <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>A negative result indicates that all samples in the pool are negative. A positive result indicates that one or more samples in the pool are positive. Subsequent testing, informed by policy decisions, can then be used to attribute individual results. Those with a positive test result will be contacted and advised to take an individual test.</p>

<p>While cohort pooling returns a single result for the entire cohort, instead of individual results for each subject within the cohort or pool, there are several use cases that have been identified for which cohort pooling would be a valuable diagnostic tool.</p>

<p>All pooling methodologies, including cohort pooling, offer greater efficiency than individual testing for populations with a low prevalence rate (1 to 5%). For populations with a higher prevalence rate (&gt;5%), the need to retest to identify positive samples within pools reduces the efficiency gained.</p>

<h2>Lateral flow testing</h2>

<p>Lateral flow testing may be used in either symptomatic or asymptomatic populations who are at risk of COVID-19 infection. It is used to ease service demand on labs and to produce results rapidly (within 15 to 20 minutes), for timely reporting and for early detection, isolation and contact tracing of data subjects who might be infected by COVID-19.</p>

<p>Lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, known as lateral flow devices, are intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid antigens from SARS-CoV-2 in human nasal swabs, throat swabs or saliva samples.</p>

<p>Once you have taken the test, your sample will be analysed at the site and you will be informed of the result (positive, negative or unclear). An app will allow for result communication through existing data flows. You will be advised on any next steps that you should take following your result, including your legal obligation to self-isolate in the event of a positive result.</p>

<p>Negative results do not rule out possible infection and should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and confirmed with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, if necessary, for patient management. The way your data is used and managed is the same as the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test outlined in the overarching privacy notice.</p>

<h2>International arrivals – Test to Release scheme</h2>

<p>From 15 December 2020, individuals arriving into England from a country or territory that does not have a valid ‘travel corridor’ and where no travel exemption applies will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Test to Release scheme.</p>

<p>Individuals may choose to undertake a private COVID-19 test on day 5 of their self-isolation period where, if the test result is negative, they’ll be released from their duty to self-isolate.</p>

<h3>International arrivals Test to Release – how we use your data</h3>

<p>Once you have taken the test, your sample will be analysed in a laboratory and you’ll be informed of the result (positive, negative or unclear) directly by the private test provider.</p>

<p>The private test provider is under a legal obligation to also share your test data with NHS Digital, who send the data that identifies you to Public Health England and to the Test and Trace data platform within <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, and a central database held by NHSX and controlled by NHS England.</p>

<p>All information in these databases is held securely and access to this information is tightly governed, in line with data protection requirements.</p>

<p>If you have tested positive for COVID-19 your information will also be sent for contact tracing activities.</p>
