<h2>How will my information be used by the NHS Test and Trace Service?</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>&nbsp;as the controller of your personal data, will use it for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirming the appointment to the test site</li>
  <li>performing a QR code check at the test site</li>
  <li>receiving and processing your test</li>
  <li>returning your results to you</li>
  <li>contacting you (if you test positive) as part of the government contact tracing programme</li>
  <li>sharing your results with Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish health bodies (if you live in that country) to inform local planning and responses to COVID-19</li>
  <li>sharing results with Public Health England (if you live in England) to help plan and respond to COVID-19</li>
  <li>sharing your vaccination status with Public Health England (if you live in England) to understand the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including their effectiveness against different strains of the COVID-19 virus, and, where appropriate, to ask you to do a repeat test and/or an antibody test</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with your local authority (if you live in England) to verify any application you may have made for a self-isolation support payment</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with your local authority (if you live in England), to enable them to provide support and guidance to you if you are self-isolating. If there is evidence to suggest you are not complying with the duty to self-isolate without reasonable justification, your local authority may pass this information on to local police to investigate further. This may lead to enforcement action being taken against you, which could include you being fined. Local authorities may also share data with third-party organisations such as charities for support purposes</li>
  <li>sharing your self-isolation status with relevant police forces to support mandated self-isolation periods and any enforcement action that may result (if you live in England)</li>

  <li>sharing your results with NHS Digital to analyse data in relation to COVID-19 (for residents in England)</li>
  <li>undertaking quality assurance of the testing process (for example, clinical process assurance)</li>
  <li>instructing the data processors to share data for research purposes. The data processor will have appropriate data security to manage this data</li>
  <li>monitoring the flow of test data across the NHS Test and Trace systems to ensure that the tests being submitted to laboratories flow across the systems and are processed – known as test flow monitoring. For analysis to support operational decisions to improve the full end-to-end testing process</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information/testing-for-coronavirus-privacy-information--2">A full breakdown of all the purpose to which your personal data would be used for is available</a></p>

<h2>How your information will be shared by NHS Test and Trace</h2>

<p>Personal data is shared with different recipients, who sometimes are processors for us, to help us operate all elements of the service. For example, this may include NHS Digital.

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information/testing-for-coronavirus-privacy-information--2">A full list of all recipients and their role is available</a></p>

<h2>Data processors and other recipients of your data</h2>

<p>Organisations who use your data and information on behalf of a controller, can only do so with clear instructions from the controller and cannot use your data and information for any other purpose. Any use of information that is not covered by the instructions from the controller would be unlawful, unless the controller agrees and provides written permission to do this.&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>&nbsp;have appointed data processors to carry out the following activities:</p>

<ul>

  <li>to schedule appointments and capture information at the point of testing</li>

  <li>link your personal details (provided on registering for the test) to the test result</li>
  <li>forward your test results, email address and phone number to NHS Business Services Authority to send you your test results</li>
  <li>receive data to enable your results and supporting information to be communicated back to you by text and email, along with supporting information</li>
  <li>ensure your test data is being processed properly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing your personal data</h2>

<p>Data protection law requires that we explain to you how the processing of your personal data is lawful. Each element of the Test and Trace programme has been assessed to ensure that it complies with both the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and, where applicable, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).</p>

<p>The lawful bases for all elements of the Testing programme under the NHS Test and Trace service are stated in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information/testing-for-coronavirus-privacy-information--2" class="govuk-link">detailed privacy notice</a>.</p>

<h2>How long we keep information about you</h2>

<p>We will retain your personal data for up to 8 years, in accordance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/codes-of-practice-for-handling-information-in-health-and-care/records-management-code-of-practice-for-health-and-social-care-2016" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Records Management Code of Practice for Health and Social Care 2016</a>, but will dispose of your data sooner if it’s appropriate to do so.

<h2>Personal data protection and storage</h2>

<h2>International data transfers</h2>

<p>Personal data may be shared with the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) as part of an international co-ordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These transfers of personal data are made under <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-49-gdpr/">Article 49(1)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation</a> – where we need to make the restricted transfer for important reasons of public interest.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We use appropriate technical, organisational and administrative security measures to protect any information. This is overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer. We have written procedures and policies which are regularly audited, and the audits are reviewed at senior level within the <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, and also externally audited by third party assurance providers, and sometimes by the regulator (the Information Commissioner’s Office).</p>

<h2>Automated decision making or profiling</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> considers that any automated decision making is authorised by law, specifically <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/41/section/2A" rel="external" class="govuk-link">section 2A of the NHS Act (2006)</a> which permits the Secretary of State to take such steps as he considers appropriate for the purpose of protecting public health.</p>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

<p>We keep our privacy notice under regular review, and we will make new versions available on our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information" class="govuk-link">privacy notice page</a> on GOV.UK.</p>
