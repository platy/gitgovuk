<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document is part of a suite of documents which sets out the regulatory requirements for awarding organisations offering GCE qualifications.</p>

<p>We have developed all our requirements for GCE qualifications with the intention that AS and A level qualifications should fulfil the purposes set out below.</p>

<p>For A levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>define and assess achievement of the knowledge, skills and understanding which will be needed by students planning to progress to undergraduate study at a UK higher education establishment, particularly (although not only) in the same subject area</li>
  <li>set out a robust and internationally comparable post-16 academic course of study to develop that knowledge, skills and understanding</li>
  <li>permit UK universities to accurately identify the level of attainment of students</li>
  <li>provide a basis for school and college accountability measures at age 18</li>
  <li>provide a benchmark of academic ability for employers</li>
</ul>

<p>For AS qualifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide evidence of students’ achievements in a robust and internationally comparable post-16 course of study that is a sub-set of A level content</li>
  <li>enable students to broaden the range of subjects they study</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements set out in this document</h3>

<p>This document sets out the GCE Qualification Level Conditions. These conditions apply to all reformed AS and A levels – that is, all GCE AS and A level qualifications accredited by Ofqual on or after 26 May 2014.</p>

<p>It sets out our requirements in relation to setting specified levels of attainment for GCE Qualifications – awarding organisations must comply with these requirements under Condition GCE9.1. It also sets out our requirements in relation to specifying deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals – awarding organisations must comply with these requirements under Conditions GCE14.3(b), GCE17.3(b) and GCE18.4(b).</p>

<p>With respect to these qualifications, awarding organisations must also comply with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook">General Conditions of Recognition</a>, which apply to all awarding organisations and qualifications</li>
  <li>the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/new-a-level-and-as-level-qualifications-requirements-and-guidance">GCE Subject Level Conditions</a>, including those which apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gce-subject-level-conditions-for-2022">qualifications taken by Learners in 2022</a>
</li>
  <li>all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulatory-document-list">relevant Regulatory Documents</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Revisions to this document</h3>

<p>We have revised this document since it was originally published (see Appendix 1 for details), most recently in April 2022.</p>

<p>The April 2022 version of this document replaces all previous versions of GCE Qualification Level Conditions and Requirements with effect from 09:30 on 22 April  2022.</p>

  <li>(g) ensure that the arrangements in place for the review of the Centre’s marking of an assessment require the Assessor carrying out the review to  consider the Centre’s marking of that assessment together with its marking of the same assessment as taken by other Learners in the same assessment series and to notify the Centre where either –
    <ol>
      <li>(i) the marking of the assessment under review is inconsistent with the Centre’s marking of those other assessments, or</li>
      <li>(ii) its marking is inconsistent across all of the assessments considered.</li>

<h2>Advance information principles</h2>

<h3>Principles in relation to advance information for Assessments by Examination in 2022</h3>

<p>Condition GCE4.5 allows us to specify principles in relation to information about the content which will be assessed for an advance information qualification for Assessments by Examination in 2022.</p>

<p>We set out below our principles for the purposes of Condition GCE4.5:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The advance information should not be so detailed that Learners are able to memorise answers to write in the exam.</li>
  <li>The advance information should not be so extensive or specific that it will damage a Learner’s progression to higher level qualifications in the subject.</li>
  <li>It should still be possible to differentiate between Learners on the basis of their performance.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Standard setting requirements</h2>

<h3>Requirements for setting specified levels of attainment for GCE Qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition GCE9.1(b) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the setting of specified levels of attainment for GCE Qualifications.
We set out below our requirements for the purposes of Condition GCE9.1(b).</p>

<p>These requirements apply only to assessments for A level qualifications that are graded A* to E and assessments for AS qualifications that are graded A to E. 
For ease of reference, the specified levels of attainment used in GCE Qualifications are referred to below as ‘grades’.</p>

<h4>Setting specified levels of attainment</h4>

<p>For AS and A level the two key grade boundaries are:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) E/U</li>
  <li>(b) A/B</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must set these key grade boundaries for each Component. In doing this, the awarding organisation must have regard to achieving suitable qualification level outcomes.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation must set the key grade boundaries for the qualification as a whole using the following method:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) The boundary mark for each Component is scaled as necessary to reflect the intended weighting of that Component as detailed in the specification.</li>
  <li>(b) The resulting scaled Component boundary marks are added and the result is rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 rounded up).</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must determine the B/C, C/D and D/E qualification grade boundaries arithmetically:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) The grade B/C, C/D and D/E boundary marks are calculated by dividing the mark interval between the A/B and E/U boundaries by four.</li>
  <li>(b) Where there is a remainder of one, the extra mark is added to the A to B mark interval.</li>
  <li>(c) Where there is a remainder of two, one extra mark is added to each of the A to B and B to C mark intervals.</li>
  <li>(d) Where there is a remainder of three, one extra mark is added to each of the A to B, B to C and C to D mark intervals.</li>
</ol>

<p>In respect of A level qualifications, an awarding organisation must set the A*/A boundary using appropriate statistical and technical evidence.</p>

<p>So long as the requirements in Condition E10.1 are met, an awarding organisation may permit a Learner to carry forward his or her mark/moderated mark (scaled as appropriate) for an assessment which is not an Assessment by Examination from a previous attempt at the same qualification awarded by the awarding organisation.</p>

<h2>Requirements for key dates</h2>

<h3>Reviews of marking, moderation, and appeals: requirements for key dates for GCE Qualifications</h3>

<p>We set out below the requirements which an awarding organisation must comply with when it specifies deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. These requirements are published under Conditions GCE14.3(b), GCE17.3(b) and GCE18.4(b) and apply to all GCE Qualifications.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations are no longer required to set deadline dates for Learners/Centres to request reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. In choosing to set any deadlines, an awarding organisation must comply with the requirements set out below and with all other requirements in its Conditions of Recognition.</p>

<p>In particular the requirements set out below must be read and complied with in conjunction with the GCE Qualification Level Conditions (which set out further requirements in relation to an awarding organisation’s arrangements).</p>

<p>The requirements set out below align with the GCE Qualification Level Conditions which are in effect. Some relevant GCE Qualification Level Conditions have not yet come into effect and there are currently some transitional provisions in effect. We will keep the requirements set out below under review as any changes are made.</p>

<h4>Requirements for key dates for assessments other than assessments which are marked by a Centre</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the requirements in the table below are met in each case where the assessment is not marked by a Centre. The table sets out the minimum timeframe within which the awarding organisation must allow a review or appeal to be requested. Provided a review or appeal is allowed to be requested in that timeframe, an awarding organisation is permitted to also provide an ‘accelerated service’ (for example, where requests for reviews provided by an earlier date will be processed more quickly).</p>

<p>The footnotes in the table are for information only.</p>
