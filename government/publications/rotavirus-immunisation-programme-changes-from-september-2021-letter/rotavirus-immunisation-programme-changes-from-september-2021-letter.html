<h4>Guidance on rotavirus vaccination at 8 weeks of age in relation to the forthcoming evaluation of the introduction of newborn screening for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>).</h4>

<p>Dear Colleague</p>

<p>This is a follow up communication to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bcg-immunisation-programme-changes-from-september-2021-letter">letter dated 27 July 2021</a> which informed Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (<abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr>) vaccination providers of the evaluation of the introduction of screening for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>) from September 2021, and the necessity to move neonatal <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination to when the child reaches 28 days of age or soon after to ensure that babies with <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> are not given the live attenuated <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine.</p>

<p>Rotavirus (Rotarix®) oral vaccine is also a live vaccine which is given routinely from 8 weeks of age. Diarrhoea and prolonged excretion of the vaccine virus has been reported in severely immunosuppressed individuals and so the vaccine is contraindicated in babies with <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>. This letter will inform providers of what action to take in relation to babies born on or after 1 September 2021.</p>

<p>As with the changes to the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> programme, it is necessary to adopt this guidance for the rotavirus vaccination nationally to ensure consistency and safety for all babies across the country.</p>

<p>This letter is aimed at health professionals who are responsible for delivering the routine infant immunisation schedule. We encourage you to share this guidance with all those involved in your area.</p>

<h3>Key points about the impact of the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> evaluation on rotavirus vaccination</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to babies born on or after 1 September 2021, who will attend for their routine 8 week immunisation appointment from 27 October 2021.</p>

<p>Rotavirus (Rotarix®) vaccine is a live oral vaccine routinely given at 8 and 12 weeks of age as part of the infant immunisation schedule. All live vaccines, including Rotarix®, are contraindicated in babies who receive a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> diagnosis.</p>

<p>in the areas participating in the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> evaluation, <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening will form part of the routine newborn screening test at 5 days, with most results expected within 10 to 12 days. All babies should have a result available by 28 days, including those in non-screening areas where they will be assigned a ‘<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening not offered’ result.</p>

<p>Childhood Information Systems (<abbr title="Childhood Information Systems">CHISs</abbr>) will receive <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcomes (as part of newborn blood spot results), and will inform practices when available and ahead of the 8 week immunisation appointment.</p>

<p>Practices should update their protocols to ensure that where <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> results (including <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening not offered) have been received by the practice, they are available to the patient record for the practice nurse at the 8 week immunisation appointment.</p>

<p>Parents and GP practices will receive a direct communication from the immunology team to alert them that a child has a suspected or confirmed <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> diagnosis and this will include information on which vaccines should not be given.</p>

<p>Immunisers should make reasonable efforts to ascertain the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcome before administering rotavirus vaccine. This would involve checking for a record in the Red Book, the GP record, screening outcome information sent by <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr>, or with the parent or caregiver. In the absence of an abnormal <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening result, or if no result can be found, rotavirus vaccination can go ahead. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> have developed an algorithm to assist immunisers with this check on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rotavirus-vaccination-progarmme-for-infants" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> rotavirus collection page</a>. It is advised that practices include this algorithm in their local protocols.</p>

<p>In areas where <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening will not be offered routinely, immunisers need to be aware that there may be movers-in who have been tested and have a result available from another area.</p>

<p>It is important to use all opportunities to remind parents and caregivers to bring the Red Book and the letter with the outcome of newborn bloodspot screening when they are invited for their routine 8 week immunisation appointment. This could include an explicit mention in the invitation letter (<abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> or GP) and text message reminders.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency and safety for all babies across the country, it is necessary for immunisation providers to adopt this guidance nationally, and regardless of whether the GP practice is located in an area participating in the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening evaluation.</p>

<h4>Additional information</h4>

<p>All relevant immunisation information for parents and caregivers will be updated and available on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immunisation" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> immunisation collection page</a> and available to order from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthpublications.gov.uk/Home.html" rel="external">Health Publications website</a>.</p>

<p>Further detailed healthcare professional information and guidance on rotavirus vaccination, including training slides, will be updated.</p>

<p>An algorithm for the process of checking for <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening results will be developed for practices.</p>

<p>The current <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rotavirus-vaccine-rotarix-patient-group-direction-pgd-template" class="govuk-link">Patient Group Direction (<abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr>)</a> for the administration of Rotarix® already excludes those with a diagnosis of <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>, therefore changes are not required.</p>

<p>A summary of key information is set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rotavirus-immunisation-programme-changes-from-september-2021-letter/rotavirus-immunisation-programme-changes-from-september-2021-letter" class="govuk-link">Annexe A</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about the content of this letter, please contact <a href="mailto:immunisation@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">immunisation@phe.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank all involved for their continuing hard work in delivering childhood immunisation programmes.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
