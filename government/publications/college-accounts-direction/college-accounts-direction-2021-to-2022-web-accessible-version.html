<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The College Accounts Direction 2021 to 2022 (<abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr>) sets out the Education and Skills Funding Agency’s (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>’s) financial reporting requirements for further education and sixth-form college corporations for their financial year ending 31 July 2022.</p>

<p>We publish the accounts direction on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, in their role as the prime funder and principal regulator of corporations as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-charities-cc23">exempt charities</a>. Compliance with this accounts direction is a requirement of corporations’ funding agreements with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Designated institutions</h3>

<p>We use the term corporation to refer to further education and sixth-form college corporations, established under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/13/contents" rel="external">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>. This <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr> applies equally to institutions designated under Section 28 of the same act as being in the further education sector, to the extent permitted by their legal status and underlying legislation.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>We plan to update this document annually. This edition applies to all financial reporting periods commencing on or after 1 August 2021. It will remain in force until such time as it is replaced.</p>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> published a supplementary bulletin to the <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr> 2020 to 2021 and the Post-16 Audit Code of Practice 2020 to 2021 which addressed the impacts of COVID-19 and remains extant. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> does not intend to issue a further supplementary bulletin for the year 2021 to 2022. However, corporations may rely on the bulletin for the year 2020 to 2021 with regard to any pandemic related disclosures or regularity issues that relate to the year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>Who is this publication for?</h3>

<p>This accounts direction is primarily for use by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>principals, chief executives / accounting officers, and finance directors</li>
  <li>governors</li>
  <li>external auditors / reporting accountants</li>
</ul>

<p>This document does not apply to specialist post-16 institutions, non-maintained special schools or independent training providers. Academy trusts with post-16 provision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> should refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-accounts-direction">academies accounts direction</a>. Higher education institutions that are part-funded by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will be deemed to meet the requirements of this accounts direction if they comply with the extant accounts direction issued by the Office for Students (<abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>).</p>

<p>This document does not apply to institutes of technology (IoTs). However, there may be circumstances where an IoT is consolidated within the accounts of the college corporation in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (<abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102) Section 9 and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/statement-of-recommended-practice-2019.aspx" rel="external">Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education 2019 edition</a> (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>).</p>

<h3>What has changed in the 2022 edition?</h3>

<p>Changes in the 2022 edition include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we have notified that <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> does not intend to issue a supplementary bulletin concerning pandemic-related disclosures and regularity matters for the current year, but that the bulletin for the year 2020 to 2021 may be relied upon for any such matters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have revised the wording concerning the circumstances in which the accounts of Institutes of Technology (IoTs) might need to be consolidated and instead simply asked that the considerations set out in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr> (section 4) and <abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102 (paragraphs 9.2 to 9.11) be followed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have been more consistent in the terminology concerning the strategic report/members report and referred to it in the former terms throughout</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have updated the link which must be used to submit the statements and clarified that the statements of any dormant subsidiaries need not be submitted (paragraphs 1 and 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have confirmed that the finance record for the year 2021 to 2022 is a single-year outturn statement only (paragraph 11)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have clarified that any reference to Office for Students (<abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>) accounting and audit requirements set out in the <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr> must not be taken as representing the entirety of <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ requirements and that college corporations and their auditors will need to read and understand the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction (paragraph 17)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have introduced 2 new requirements in the statement of corporate governance and internal control:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a report on activities undertaken over the year to develop governors and clerks/governance professionals (Annex A)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a report on whether the corporation has conducted/ commissioned an internal or external review of governance (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a>)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have repositioned the statement on regularity, propriety and compliance as being primarily a statement on the part of the accounting officer (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexB">Annex B</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in relation to trustee expenses, we have clarified that charity commission consent is not necessary for the routine reimbursement of expenses, and that this consent is only required when there is to be a remunerative element (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexD">Annex D</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have specified that a corporation must disclose any related party transactions (RPTs) with wholly-owned subsidiaries or with any parent entity of which the corporation<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> itself is a subsidiary (Annex D)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have specified that where there have been no RPTs at all, a corporation must make a statement to this effect (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexD">Annex D</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Clarification of terms</h3>

<p>We use the terms ‘must’ and ‘should’ in this document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must – means a requirement</li>
  <li>should – identifies minimum good practice for which there is no requirement, but which corporations should apply unless there is an alternative which better suits their circumstances</li>
</ul>

<h2>Further information and feedback</h2>

<p>Additional guidance on the application of the requirements of this Accounts Direction and on various other relevant accounting and disclosure requirements is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.aoc.co.uk/funding-and-corporate-services/funding-and-finance/accounting-and-financial-planning" rel="external">College Accounts Direction Handbook</a> published by the Association of Colleges (<abbr title="Association of Colleges">AoC</abbr>). The <abbr title="Association of Colleges">AoC</abbr> also produces a set of model accounts that show how a further education or sixth-form college corporation could apply the requirements of the <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr> and of the underpinning financial reporting framework. Corporations and their auditors can also ask <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> questions via an online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Submission requirements</h2>

<h3>Submission of documents</h3>

<p><strong>1</strong>: Corporations must submit the following documents to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> by 31 December 2022:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a signed copy of the audited annual report and financial statements (the accounts) including the corporation’s statement of regularity, propriety and compliance and the reporting accountant’s assurance report on regularity</li>
  <li>external auditor’s management letter, including the corporation’s responses to the findings raised</li>
  <li>annual report of the corporation’s audit committee</li>
  <li>a signed copy of the audited accounts of all non-dormant subsidiary companies (if any)</li>
  <li>the college’s finance record<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>, as required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-planning-handbook">College Financial Planning Handbook</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2</strong>: The above documents must be submitted to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/cfp" rel="external">college financial data submissions portal</a>. Corporations will need their IDAMS (Identity and Access Management System) login to access the portal. There is no requirement to submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hard copies of documents to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>documents to the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> – <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will share information with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> to facilitate their conditions of registration compliance monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3</strong>: We take late submission of financial information very seriously and corporations that miss key deadlines risk <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fe-colleges-intervention-policy-and-the-fe-commissioner-role"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> intervention</a>. It is important corporations inform <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> at the earliest opportunity if the deadline of 31 December may be missed.</p>

<p>Where corporations experience financial difficulties or bank covenant breaches that  impact on whether their financial statements can be prepared on a going concern basis and thus, the external auditor’s ability to conclude their work based in this area, the corporation should notify <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> as soon as possible. This is irrespective of whether there is a risk that the submission deadline may be missed.</p>

<h3>Extended and short period accounts</h3>

<p><strong>4</strong>: Corporations may only produce extended period final accounts if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>this does not contravene their articles of government</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>’s prior approval has been obtained</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5</strong>: Corporations producing either extended period final accounts beyond 31 July 2022 or short period final accounts ending prior to 31 July 2022 must meet the requirements and timescales set out by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>: In respect of business combinations, the chair and accounting officer of the receiving corporation are responsible for signing, and submitting to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, the audited accounts of a dissolving corporation by 31 December 2022.</p>

<h3>Approval of documents</h3>

<p><strong>7</strong>: Financial statements must be approved by the corporation and signed as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Component</th>
      <th scope="col">Signatory</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Strategic report (or equivalent)</td>
      <td>Chair of governors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Balance sheet(s)</td>
      <td>Accounting officer and one other member of the corporation (usually chair of governors)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Statement of corporate governance and internal control (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a>)</td>
      <td>Accounting officer and chair of governors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Statement of regularity, propriety and compliance (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexB">Annex B</a>)</td>
      <td>Accounting officer and chair of governors</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Statement of responsibilities of the members of the corporation (<a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexC">Annex C</a>)</td>
      <td>Chair of governors</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>8</strong>: Components should be signed on the same date, which should be on or very shortly before the date the auditor signs their independent auditors’ report to the corporation and regularity report. The date of approval must be stated.</p>

<h3>Publishing accounts</h3>

<p><strong>9</strong>: Corporations must publish their audited accounts in an easily accessible location on their website. To maximise transparency and to support accountability, this should be done as soon as possible after the accounts are signed and must be no later than 31 January 2023. Corporations must retain at least two years of accounts on their website<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.  As charities, corporations must also provide their accounts to anyone requesting a copy. In addition, corporations that are registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> should be mindful of the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ publication requirements and timeline.</p>

<p><strong>10</strong>: Stakeholders have a right to expect information on the financial performance and results of a corporation to be published on their website. Failure to do so is a breach of the corporation’s funding agreement with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Submissions to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>The Finance record</h3>

<p><strong>11</strong>: Corporations must submit a finance record to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> by 31 December 2022, which incorporates a financial outturn statement for the year 2021 to 2022. Details of subsequent financial returns required by corporations will be published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-planning-handbook">College Financial Planning Handbook</a>.</p>

<h2>Benchmarking</h2>

<p><strong>12</strong>: <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will use the data for 2021 to 2022 from the finance record to support the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-benchmarking-tool-for-colleges">financial benchmarking tool for colleges</a>. This tool allows corporations to compare their financial performance with others in the sector. It is important that corporations ensure all tabs in the finance record are completed accurately.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Basis for preparing accounts</h2>

<h3>Financial accounting framework</h3>

<p><strong>13</strong>: In preparing their accounts, corporations must follow the financial accounting framework of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/accountants/accounting-and-reporting-policy/uk-accounting-standards/standards-in-issue/frs-102-the-financial-reporting-standard-applicabl" rel="external"><abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102 (Financial Reporting Standard 102)</a>; and</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/publications/statement-recommended-practice" rel="external">Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education (<abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>)</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>14</strong>: Corporations’ statements, as required by the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statement of principal accounting policies and estimation techniques</li>
  <li>a statement of comprehensive income presenting the financial performance during the reporting period of the corporation, and a statement of comprehensive income of the consolidated group, if such a group exists</li>
  <li>a statement of changes in reserves of the corporation and a statement of changes in reserves of the consolidated group, if such a group exists</li>
  <li>a statement of financial position presenting the financial position of the corporation, and a statement of financial position of the consolidated group, if such a group exists, at the end of the reporting period</li>
  <li>a statement of cash flows of the corporation, and a statement of cash flows of the consolidated group, if such a group exists</li>
  <li>notes to the financial statements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Related reports and statements</h3>

<p><strong>15</strong>: As required by the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, corporations must publish the following reports with the financial statements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a strategic report (which may alternatively be entitled a treasurer’s report, members’ report, directors’ report, report of the governing body or trustees’ annual report)</li>
  <li>a statement of corporate governance and internal control</li>
  <li>statement of responsibilities of the members of the corporation, and</li>
  <li>an independent auditor’s report to the corporation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>16</strong>: In addition to the above, the financial statements will also include a reporting accountant’s assurance report on regularity.</p>

<h3>Corporations registered with the Office for Students</h3>

<p><strong>17</strong>: Corporations that are registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> are subject to the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> regulatory framework and accounts direction in addition to this <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr>. Although <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> and the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> have cooperated to harmonise their accounting and disclosure requirements, there remain some areas of divergence. There are some areas where disclosures are required to differing levels of detail based on each organisation’s requirements and the regulatory context. A summary of these areas of divergence is set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexE">Annex E</a>, though this is only a summary and corporations registered with <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> should always refer to the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction as the definitive source of <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ requirements . However, where disclosure requirements overlap, disclosure should be made only once for the purposes of both organisations.</p>

<h3>Corporations that are not registered with the Office for Students</h3>

<p><strong>18</strong>: Corporations that are not registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> are not obliged to follow the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction and may prepare their accounts on the basis of <abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102, the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr> and the requirements of this <abbr title="college accounts direction">CAD</abbr> alone.</p>

<h3>Other considerations</h3>

<p><strong>19</strong>: Corporations must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include the statements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexB">Annex B</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexC">Annex C</a>
</li>
  <li>follow the accounting and disclosure requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexD">Annex D</a>
</li>
  <li>adopt an accounting reference date of 31 July<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>provide in their strategic report an assessment of whether the corporation is a going concern, including any supporting assumptions, qualifications and mitigating actions, as appropriate (which must be consistent with other disclosures in the accounts, for example in the notes to the financial statements, and auditor’s report)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>20</strong>: Assurance and audit arrangements are set out in <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-audit-code-of-practice">Post-16 Audit Code of Practice</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex A: statement of corporate governance and internal control</h2>

<p>Good corporate governance is fundamental to any effective organisation and is the hallmark of a well-managed entity, and for corporations it demonstrates they are conducting business in the best interests of their students and in accordance with their funding requirements. A good source of advice on the legal and regulatory framework applying to the corporation is the Department for Education’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/fe-governance">governance guide</a>. All corporations must comply with at least one of the following governance codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.charitygovernancecode.org/en" rel="external">Charity Governance Code</a> (endorsed by the Charity Commission)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.aoc.co.uk/funding-and-corporate-services/governance/governance-resources/code-good-governance-english-colleges" rel="external">Code of Good Governance for English Colleges</a> (developed by Association of Colleges)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-governance-and-stewardship/uk-corporate-governance-code" rel="external">The UK Corporate Governance Code 2018</a>. Corporations that adopt this code are not expected to comply with those requirements that are not relevant to further education and sixth-form college corporations. However, they should have due regard to the principles and guidance insofar as they apply to the further education and charity sectors</li>
</ul>

<p>Corporations must adopt a governance code that best reflects their legal structure and operations.</p>

<p>Corporations must include a statement of corporate governance and internal control within their annual report and accounts, covering the beginning of the financial period to the date of the signing of the accounts for that financial period, which must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declaration of compliance with their adopted governance code with explanations for any departures, or</li>
  <li>if not adopted, a statement to the effect of, ‘whilst not having adopted the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-governance-and-stewardship/uk-corporate-governance-code" rel="external">UK Corporate Governance Code 2018</a>, the corporation has due regard to its principles and guidance’</li>
  <li>details of those who served as governors of the corporation during the year including a record of attendance at meetings</li>
  <li>the number of audit committee meetings which took place in the year and attendance records for each committee member</li>
  <li>the governance framework, including:
    <ul>
      <li>committee structure</li>
      <li>the process for making appointments to the corporation</li>
      <li>coverage of the corporation’s work during the period</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>how the corporation identifies, evaluates and manages risk (including an impact and likelihood evaluation of key operational, financial, compliance and other risks)</li>
  <li>any significant internal control weaknesses or failures that have arisen, and actions taken</li>
  <li>the internal control and assurance framework and how the corporation has met its:
    <ul>
      <li>statutory responsibility for ‘the effective and efficient use of resources, the solvency of the institution and the corporate body and the safeguarding of their assets’ (as required by Section 5(3)(c) of Schedule 4 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/13/contents" rel="external">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>)</li>
      <li>contractual responsibilities under its funding agreements and contracts with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of the corporation’s performance, including an assessment of its own effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a statement from the audit committee which draws upon the work set out in its annual report and, where appropriate, the work of internal audit. This should include a statement on the effectiveness of the college’s framework of internal control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of any activities undertaken during the year to develop governors and clerks/heads of governance</p>
  </li>
  <li>confirmation that the corporation has conducted an annual self-assessment of governance and, if applicable, that an external governance review (required every 3 years) has taken place. The name of the external reviewer and when the review was conducted must also be disclosed. Corporations should provide a summary of the review findings and any associated action plan in either the statement of corporate governance and internal control or on the college website</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement of corporate governance and internal control should cover the financial period, as well as any matters up to and including the date the accounts are approved.</p>

<p>Corporations that are registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> and are therefore subject to the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction should consider any additional elements required in the statement of corporate governance and internal control set out in the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction. These elements are summarised at <a class="govuk-link" href="#AnnexE">Annex E</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex B: statement of regularity, propriety and compliance</h2>

<p>Corporations are in receipt of significant public funding and must be able to assure <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, who in turn assures Parliament and the public, of high standards of propriety in the management of those funds. This assurance is provided primarily through the accounting officer, who bears a personal responsibility for these issues, which exists independently of any they hold as part of the board or executive management. The accounting officer must sign a statement of regularity, propriety and compliance each year and submit this with the accounts. The contents of the statement must be discussed with the corporation and the chair of governors must also sign the statement to attest to this fact.</p>

<p>Corporations that are registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> and therefore fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction should consider any additional elements required in this statement which arise from the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction, including compliance with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ ongoing conditions of registration and terms and conditions of funding.</p>

<p>The statement must be prepared in the following format:</p>

<h3>Statement of regularity, propriety and compliance</h3>

<p>As accounting officer I confirm that the corporation has had due regard to the requirements of grant funding agreements and contracts with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> and has considered its responsibility to notify <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> of material irregularity, impropriety and non-compliance with terms and conditions of funding.</p>

<p>I confirm on behalf of the corporation that after due enquiry, and to the best of my knowledge, I am able to identify any material irregular or improper use of funds by the corporation, or material non-compliance with the terms and conditions of funding, under the corporation’s grant funding agreements and contracts with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, or any other public funder.</p>

<p><strong>[Either:]</strong> I confirm that no instances of material irregularity, impropriety or funding non-compliance have been discovered to date. If any instances are identified after the date of this statement, these will be notified to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>[Or:]</strong> I confirm that the following instances of material irregularity, impropriety or funding non-compliance have been discovered and have been notified to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>. If any further instances are identified after the date of this statement, these will be notified to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>:</p>

<p>*[instances to be raised]</p>

<p><strong>[Signed]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Name to be typed]</strong></p>

<p>Accounting officer</p>

<p><strong>[Date]</strong></p>

<h3>Statement of the chair of governors</h3>

<p>On behalf of the corporation, I confirm that the accounting officer has discussed their statement of regularity, propriety and compliance with the board and that I am content that it is materially accurate.</p>

<p><strong>[Signed]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Name to be typed]</strong></p>

<p>Chair of governors</p>

<p><strong>[Date]</strong></p>

<h2>Annex C: statement of responsibilities of the members of the corporation</h2>

<p>The chair of governors must sign a statement of responsibilities of the members of the corporation each year on behalf of the corporation and submit this with the accounts.  Additional detail may be added to the model statement, as needed, for the specific circumstances of the corporation.</p>

<p>Corporations registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> must also comply with any additional requirements set out in the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction with effect from the date of registration.</p>

<h3>Statement of responsibilities of the members of the corporation</h3>

<p>The members of the corporation are required to present audited financial statements for each financial year.</p>

<p>Within the terms and conditions of the corporation’s grant funding agreements and contracts with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> [<strong>delete if necessary</strong> - and any other relevant funding bodies], the corporation is required to prepare financial statements which give a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the corporation for the relevant period. Corporations must also prepare a strategic report which includes an operating and financial review for the year. The bases for the preparation of the financial statements and strategic report are the Statement of Recommended Practice – Accounting for Further and Higher Education, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>’s College Accounts Direction and the UK’s Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. In preparing the financial statements, the corporation is required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently</li>
  <li>make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent</li>
  <li>state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements</li>
  <li>assess whether the corporation is a going concern, noting the key supporting assumptions, qualifications or mitigating actions, as appropriate (which must be consistent with other disclosures in the accounts and auditor’s report)</li>
  <li>prepare financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to assume that the corporation will continue in operation</li>
</ul>

<p>The corporation is also required to prepare a strategic report, in accordance with paragraphs 3.23 to 3.27 of the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, that describes what it is trying to do and how it is going about it, including information about the legal and administrative status of the corporation.</p>

<p>The corporation is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position of the corporation and which enable it to ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with relevant legislation including the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/13/contents" rel="external">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/contents" rel="external">Charities Act 2011</a>, and relevant accounting standards. It is responsible for taking steps that are reasonably open to it to safeguard its assets and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.</p>

<p>The corporation is responsible for the maintenance and integrity of its website(s); the work carried out by auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Members of the corporation are responsible for ensuring that expenditure and income are applied for the purposes intended and that the financial transactions conform to the authorities that govern them. In addition, they are responsible for ensuring that funds from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, and any other public funds, are used only in accordance with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>’s grant funding agreements and contracts and any other conditions, that may be prescribed from time to time by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, or any other public funder. Members of the corporation must ensure that there are appropriate financial and management controls in place to safeguard public and other funds and ensure they are used properly. In addition, members of the corporation are responsible for securing economic, efficient and effective management of the corporation’s resources and expenditure so that the benefits that should be derived from the application of public funds from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> and other public bodies are not put at risk.</p>

<p>Approved by order of the members of the corporation on <strong>[date]</strong> and signed on its behalf by:</p>

<p><strong>[Signed]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Name to be typed]</strong></p>

<p>Chair of governors</p>

<h2>Annex D: specific accounting and disclosure matters</h2>

<p>We draw corporations’ attention to several specific accounting and disclosure matters that are considered to go beyond the requirements of <abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102 and the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> &amp; <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Remuneration disclosures</h3>

<p>Corporations receive significant investment from public funds and need to demonstrate to stakeholders that decisions made on executive pay are evidence-based, proportionate and represent value for money. As a matter of policy, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires increased transparency around executive pay to support accountability, and to help maintain public confidence and trust in executive pay. Some of these disclosures also reflect the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction.</p>

<p>Corporations should make comprehensive disclosures and consider what other information enhances transparency and understandability. For example, corporations could consider providing stakeholders with more meaningful information to help them understand pay structures and movements.</p>

<p>Corporations should be aware of the <abbr title="Association of Colleges">AoC</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.aoc.co.uk/sites/default/files/Colleges%20Senior%20Staff%20Remuneration%20Code.pdf" rel="external">Colleges’ Senior Staff Remuneration Code</a> and, for corporations that fall within scope of the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.universitychairs.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/HE-Remuneration-Code.pdf" rel="external">The Higher Education Senior Staff Remuneration Code</a> issued by the Committee of University Chairs (CUC).</p>

<p>Corporations must either adopt one of the codes or explain why they have not done so. This means that corporations must either state that they have followed the minimum requirements of the relevant code or provide meaningful explanations for non-compliance and how their alternative arrangements meet the principles of transparency, accountability, proportionality, understandability, value for money and the extent to which remuneration for senior people is evidence-based.</p>

<h3>i.	Legal status</h3>

<p>The corporation must include details of its charitable status.</p>

<h3>ii.	Public benefit</h3>

<p>The corporation must provide a statement that it has had due regard for the Charity Commission’s (CC’s) guidance ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/charitable-purposes-and-public-benefit">Charitable Purposes and Public Benefit</a>’. It must also provide a report on how the corporation has delivered its charitable purposes for the public benefit.</p>

<h3>iii.	Plans for future periods / reserves policy</h3>

<p>We require transparency in corporation accounts, which should, where appropriate, include plans for student recruitment, cost savings and efficiencies such as shared services and structural change.</p>

<p>We also encourage corporations to review their reserves policy and the level of reserves held, setting out, where appropriate, how these align with strategic plans and to the CC’s guidance ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/charities-and-reserves-cc19">Charity Reserves: Building Resilience</a>’.</p>

<h3>iv.	Staff numbers and costs</h3>

<p>Corporations must disclose in the notes to the accounts the average staff numbers employed by the corporation in the year, categorised by role. This disclosure is in line with the Companies Act 2006 section 411. The figures must be the average headcount for each category, calculated on a monthly basis. Corporations should note that <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will continue to collect staff numbers on the basis of full-time equivalents through the finance record or equivalent. Corporations may also wish to provide this information in the accounts.</p>

<p>The notes must disclose the total staff costs of the corporation relating to the year, broken down between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wages and salaries paid or payable to staff members,</li>
  <li>social security costs incurred by the corporation on their behalf, and</li>
  <li>pension costs</li>
</ul>

<h3>v.	Remuneration of key management personnel and high-paid staff</h3>

<h4>(a)	Key management personnel</h4>

<p>In addition to disclosure requirements set out in the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, corporations must disclose in the notes to the accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of key management personnel whose emoluments received in the year (gross of any salary sacrifice arrangements and excluding any employer pension costs) that fall within each band of £5,000 from a starting point of £nil</li>
  <li>aggregate emoluments received by key management personnel, split by type of emolument, both including and excluding pension contributions</li>
  <li>aggregate emoluments due to key management personnel, but waived</li>
  <li>justification for the total emoluments linked to value and performance delivered, alongside an explanation of the processes adopted for judging performance and total emoluments, including benchmarking or other means of comparison to the broader market</li>
</ul>

<p>Where previous key management personnel continue to receive emoluments in an employed or consultancy role, such as in an advisory or sabbatical role, this must be disclosed, with an explanation. For the avoidance of doubt, where in exceptional circumstances a senior leader is not directly employed by the corporation itself, their emoluments must also be disclosed.</p>

<h4>(b)	Accounting officer</h4>

<p>Corporations must separately disclose emoluments of the accounting officer (and of the highest-paid member of key management personnel in the unlikely event this is not the accounting officer), both including and excluding pension contributions. Corporations must break down this disclosure by emolument type (see (e) below) in their accounts. Severance payments and compensation for loss of office paid to the accounting officer and, if different, the highest-paid member of key management personnel must also be separately disclosed.</p>

<p>A justification for the total emoluments of the accounting officer must be disclosed, linked to value and performance delivered, alongside an explanation of the processes adopted for judging performance and total emoluments, including benchmarking or other means of comparison to the broader market.</p>

<p>Where there has been more than one accounting officer during the period, the emoluments and any other payments of each must be disclosed separately, together with their start and end date.</p>

<p>Where a previous accounting officer continues to receive emoluments in an employed or consultancy role, such as in an advisory or sabbatical role, this must be disclosed with an explanation.</p>

<h4>(c)	Pay multiple</h4>

<p>Corporations must disclose the relationship between the accounting officer’s emoluments (or those of the highest-paid member of key management personnel, if this is not the accounting officer) and that of all other employees as a pay multiple, expressed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounting officer’s basic salary divided by the median pay of all other corporation employees (all on a full-time equivalent basis); and</li>
  <li>accounting officer’s total emoluments divided by the median pay of all other corporation employees (all on a full-time equivalent basis)</li>
</ul>

<p>The corporation must briefly explain the basis of their methodology and any exceptions applied, such as agency workers.</p>

<h4>(d)	Higher-paid staff</h4>

<p>Corporations must disclose the number of higher-paid staff whose emoluments received in the year (excluding any employer pension costs) fall within each band of £5,000 from a starting point of £60,000. If a part-time member of staff received less than £60,000 in the year but would have received at least £60,000 on a full-time basis, this should be set out as a narrative disclosure within the note.</p>

<h4>(e)	Definitions for part iv</h4>

<ul>
  <li>basic salary</li>
  <li>fees</li>
  <li>performance-related pay and other bonuses, including any deferred payment arrangements and separate disclosure of any amounts waived</li>
  <li>expense allowances (to the extent that they are chargeable to UK income tax)</li>
  <li>pension contributions</li>
  <li>payments in lieu of pension contributions</li>
  <li>any sums paid under any pension scheme in relation to employment with the corporation</li>
  <li>monetary value of any taxable benefits other than cash (for example, company cars, subsidised loans and accommodation)</li>
  <li>employee benefits provided by, or on behalf of, the corporation</li>
  <li>any other type of emolument and cost to the corporation of providing each type, for example, loss of benefits, ex-gratia, consultancy, agency payments, accepting office (‘golden handshake’), relocation costs, dividends, ‘off payroll’ payments or payments in lieu of notice</li>
  <li>monetary value of any non-taxable benefits available only to key management personnel or higher-paid staff</li>
  <li>any of the above provided by any subsidiaries, joint ventures or other related entities</li>
</ul>

<p>Emoluments do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adjustments arising from <abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102 (section 28) otherwise included in the staff costs note</li>
  <li>employer’s national insurance contributions (NIC)</li>
  <li>compensation for loss of office</li>
  <li>salary sacrifice arrangements</li>
</ul>

<p>Corporations must, however, disclose separately any salary sacrifice arrangements, or if there are no such arrangements a statement to that effect.</p>

<h3>vi. Compensation for loss of office</h3>

<p>Corporations must disclose details of any compensation for loss of office, loss of any other office connected with corporation affairs and/or connected with the affairs of a parent or subsidiary undertaking of the corporation; where paid or payable to the accounting officer, key management personnel (both past and present) and staff earning at least £60,000 per year. Corporations must disclose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the aggregate value of any compensation for loss of office paid or payable to these staff (excluding payments in lieu of notice)</li>
  <li>the number of people to whom this was paid or payable</li>
  <li>the nature of any benefits other than cash</li>
</ul>

<p>Compensation for loss of office includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the estimated money value of benefits other than cash</li>
  <li>compensation in consideration for, or in connection with, retirement</li>
  <li>any top-up or enhancement to the pension scheme</li>
</ul>

<h3>vii.  Severance payments</h3>

<p>Corporations must disclose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all severance costs, split between contractual and non-contractual payments</li>
  <li>whether costs were approved by the corporation or a committee established by the corporation for this purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>Corporations registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> should have regard to any additional disclosures relating to compensation for loss of office required by the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> beyond those for the accounting officer, key management personnel and staff earning at least £60,000 per year.</p>

<h3>viii. Transactions with governors/trustees</h3>

<p>All transactions with governors must be disclosed. This includes routine reimbursement of travel expenses or similar costs incurred in connection with their duties as a governor, such as the costs of childcare incurred to attend corporation meetings. However, compensation for loss of earnings requires additional authority and before making such a payment, the corporation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be satisfied that there is no remunerative element, or</li>
  <li>gain express permission from Charity Commission (CC) if a remunerative element exists, and</li>
  <li>have due regard to CC’s guidance ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trustee-expenses-and-payments-cc11">trustee expenses and payments</a>’</li>
</ul>

<p>Corporations must disclose the details of any such payments made (including the total of such payments and the number of governors/trustees who received the payments), or if none, a statement to that effect.</p>

<h3>ix. Related party transactions</h3>

<p>Corporations must follow the requirements of FRS102 and the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr> for disclosure of their transactions and balances with related parties. However, where there have been no related party transactions at all corporations must make a statement to this effect.</p>

<p>Paragraph 25.5 of the <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, which derives from the <abbr title="Financial Reporting Standard">FRS</abbr> 102 paragraph 33.1A exemption for the reporting of related party transactions and balances between two or more members of the same group in the case of wholly owned subsidiaries, is set aside. Consequently, corporations must report transactions and balances between themselves and any wholly owned subsidiaries. Likewise, if a corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of another entity, such as a Higher Education Institution, it must disclose transactions and balances with that parent entity.</p>

<h3>x. Accounting for government grants</h3>

<p>In addition to disclosure requirements set out in the relevant <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, corporations must disclose in the notes to the accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deferred income relating to government grants as separate items, distinct from other accruals and deferred income, split between under and over one year</li>
  <li>the income recognised in any period related to government grants from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> and other government bodies respectively as separate items in an analysis of income from funding body grants</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, corporations must distinguish deferred income relating to government grants between amounts attributable to capital and revenue grants. Corporations, registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>, should also have regard to the additional disclosures relating to grant and fee income set out in the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction.</p>

</h3>

<p>It is the responsibility of each corporation to comply with the requirements of this legislation as appropriate, and to disclose relevant information within their audited financial statements.</p>

<h3>xii.	The Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/1155/contents/made" rel="external">The Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018</a> (‘the 2018 regulations’) implement the government’s policy on streamlined energy and carbon reporting and came into force with effect from 1 April 2019 for accounting periods starting on or after that date. The 2018 regulations apply to certain UK companies, but as a matter of public policy corporations are encouraged to make an equivalent disclosure in respect of the reporting period 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022 on their websites. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-corporation-financial-management-good-practice-guides/streamlined-energy-and-carbon-reporting-for-college-corporations">guidance on streamlined energy and carbon reporting for colleges</a>, which includes a sector-relevant model disclosure note.</p>

<h3>xiii.	 Disclosures arising from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-audit-code-of-practice">Supplementary Bulletin</a> to the College Accounts Direction and the Post-16 Audit Code of Practice in July 2021 which had the same status as those documents. This bulletin provided guidance to principals/accounting officers, governors and their external auditors / reporting accountants on matters arising from the COVID-19 pandemic which may have impacted on the corporation’s accounts, including how the impact of the pandemic might be set out in the strategic report. It included some additional requirements for corporations in respect of COVID-19 funding and how related financial support must have been disclosed. It was a requirement of the College Accounts Direction for the year 2020 to 2021 that corporations complied with those additional terms in the Supplementary Bulletin. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will not issue a similar bulletin for the year 2021 to 2022. However, the bulletin for the year 2020 to 2021 may be relied upon for any information on pandemic-related disclosures that corporations must make in their financial statements for the year 2021 to 2022, including prior year comparative figures.</p>

<h3>xiv. Corporations’ financial review</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr> requires a fair and balanced strategic report on the corporation’s development, performance and position to be disclosed.  This report should be produced in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 3.23 to 3.26 of the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>; namely that it should be user-focussed, consistent with and complementary to the financial statements, comprehensive, understandable and balanced. 
As regulator for the college sector, and in accordance with paragraph 3.23 of the <abbr title="further education">FE</abbr> and <abbr title="higher education">HE</abbr> <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires that the financial review within this report must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain the financial effect of significant events on the financial performance and financial position of the corporation</li>
  <li>explain the overall financial position of the corporation at the reporting date with a narrative which provides context to, and insight on, the numbers in the financial statements, focussing on material or significant balances</li>
  <li>identify any subsidiary undertaking or joint venture that is materially in deficit, explaining the circumstances giving rise to the deficit and the steps being taken to address it</li>
  <li>explain the financial performance of the corporation in the year, including an explanation of the causes of the corporation’s net income/(expenditure) balance for the year</li>
  <li>describe the principal funding sources of the corporation</li>
  <li>be written in terms which a non-accountant would understand</li>
</ul>

<h3>xv. Disclosures in relation payments to fund a deficit in the Local Government Pension Scheme</h3>

<p>College corporations must note the requirements of FRS102 in relation to disclosures about defined benefit pension plans, such as the Local Government Pension Scheme. In particular, that paragraph 28.41(a) requires a general description of the type of plan, which must include the corporation’s funding policy. We draw attention to the obligation for college corporations to disclose the amount and timing of future payments to be made by the entity under any agreement with the defined benefit plan to fund a deficit.</p>

<h2>Annex E: a summary of additional reporting and disclosure requirements arising from the accounts direction issued by the Office for Students</h2>

<p>Colleges registered with the Office for Students fall within the scope of the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction and so will be obliged to make some reports or disclosures that go beyond those required by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, as summarised below. Corporations registered with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> must always refer to the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> accounts direction itself for definitive detail of <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ requirements:</p>

      <td>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires colleges to disclose whether they have adopted the <abbr title="Association of Colleges">AoC</abbr> Governors’ Council’s “The Colleges Senior Staff Remuneration Code”, so <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requirements go beyond what the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> requires in terms of disclosure. However, compliance with either code is not mandatory, so the minimal requirements of both the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> and <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> will be met if colleges have regard to both codes and then disclose whether they have adopted either.</td>

<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires disclosure of the number of staff with  total emoluments over £60k, broken down into bands of £5k. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> therefore sets the threshold at a lower level and so compliance with <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requirements will satisfy <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> requirements. Where the banding for total emoluments differs from that of basic salary, corporations could include a narrative disclosure or an additional column to the disclosure table, so that the requirements of both accounts directions are met.</td>

      <td>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires a combined Statement on corporate governance and internal control, but the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> does mandate a considerable amount of additional detail. An important example is the setting out of any significant internal control weaknesses or failures that have arisen during the financial year or after the year end, but before the financial statements were signed. Providers complying with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>’ requirements will meet <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requirements.</td>

      <th scope="row">Details of fee and grant income</th>
      <td>Paras 32 to 34</td>

      <td>
<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> requires the disclosure of government grants and other grants, but the requirement does not go beyond what would be required under the <abbr title="Standard of Recommended Practice">SORP</abbr>.

      <td>The inclusion of this disclosure is only necessary if the provider has signed up to such a plan with the <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>, and the plan has been approved by <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>.</td>
