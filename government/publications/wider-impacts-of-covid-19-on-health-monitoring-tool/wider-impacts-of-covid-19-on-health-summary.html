<p>This Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) monitoring tool looks at the wider impacts of the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic on population health. This report briefly highlights the main findings.</p>

<p>This resource will be updated weekly with new time point data for existing metrics and new metrics covering relevant themes where data become available. In some cases, a metric is from a single time point data collection and therefore figures will remain unchanged week on week. This will be continually reviewed, and the resource will be updated as appropriate for relevance and timeliness.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Areas of daily life in England have all seen some noticeable changes since the start of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic.</p>

<p>The beginning of the first national lockdown in England was 23 March. Easing of lockdown began on 10 May. At this time, people who could not work from home were encouraged to return, avoiding public transport where possible, and were allowed to take unlimited outdoor exercise.</p>

<p>Further easing took place in the first half of June, allowing up to 6 people to meet outdoors, and outdoor sports amenities and outdoor non-food markets to open. More significant lifting of restrictions took place on 15 June. This permitted reopening of retail shops and some other public-facing businesses. On 4 July pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers were permitted to open with the implementation of social distancing measures.</p>

<p>Since the easing of national restrictions, a series of local measures have been introduced. On 14 October the government introduced a 3-tier system and those areas in the highest tier were subject to the tightest restrictions. This was followed by a second national lockdown on 5 November until 2 December when the 3-tier system was reinstated.</p>

<h2>Mental health and wellbeing</h2>

<p>Self-reported mental health and wellbeing worsened during the pandemic. Adults experienced high anxiety levels and low happiness levels in the week immediately preceding the first national lockdown and the 2 following weeks. Prevalence for both indicators was more than double the average for 2019. Prevalence for both these has since declined but has generally remained above 2019 levels up to the week of the 4 Oct 2020. Further detail on this topic is available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-mental-health-and-wellbeing-surveillance-report" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>: mental health and wellbeing surveillance report</a>.</p>

<h2>Dementia</h2>

<p>Numbers of people with dementia and Alzheimer’s have fallen during the pandemic, partly due to patients not accessing services where assessment and diagnosis would take place. Prevalence of these diseases in adults aged 65 and over was lower in the months from April to October 2020 than in the averages of the same months from 2017 to 2019. The estimated diagnosis rate in adults aged 65 and over was also lower from April to October in 2020 than in 2019 and referral to a memory clinic was lower in the months from April to October 2020 than in the same months in 2018 to 2019.</p>

<h2>Community support</h2>

<p>In general, data up to 2 August show that people have felt supported during the pandemic. Similarly, the majority of people felt that people were helping others more than before. These patterns were seen across income, age, sex, and ethnic groups.</p>

<h2>Homeschooling</h2>

<p>From 23 March 2020 until the start of the 2020 autumn term, most schools in England were closed to children other than those with parents who were keyworkers or who were classed as vulnerable. In the 4-week period up to 7 June, around 70% of parents reported homeschooling their children.</p>

<h2>Travel, access to outdoor space and time spent on activities</h2>

<p>Mobility patterns changed visibly during the pandemic. The initial message to ’stay at home’ during the first national lockdown showed high levels of compliance and all transport use saw a steep decline in the following 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Following the easing of restrictions, public transport use steadily increased whilst remaining below pre-lockdown levels. There was a slight decline from the end of September to the end of October, perhaps reflecting the announcement on 23 September for people to work from home if they could and the introduction of local lockdowns.  There was steep decline in all public transport from the 5 November, the beginning of the second national lockdown.</p>

<p>Trips in light goods vehicles were back to normal levels from July but declined steeply again following the second national lockdown at the beginning of November.  Trips in cars also dropped steeply during the second lockdown. Visits to parks, whilst down at first, were above pre-lockdown levels from 25 May until 30 September, perhaps reflecting the warmer summer and early autumn weather. Trips in residential areas have been consistently above pre-lockdown levels. Trips to retail and recreation areas, and workplaces, have been gradually increasing between mid-June and the end of August when the general re-opening of English retail shops and public-facing businesses was announced. Trips to retail and recreational areas decreased at the beginning of September and remained consistent throughout October.  They have declined steeply since the beginning of the second national lockdown from 5 November.</p>

<p>Access to green space and outdoor space is important for health and wellbeing. Those living in the London region have the lowest level of access to private outdoor space but also the shortest distance to travel to access public green spaces. Those in higher income groups have greater access to private garden space as do those from a White ethnic background and those in age bands 45 years and over.</p>

<p>Restrictions in place during lockdown and subsequently have had an impact on how people were able to use their time. Comparisons with data from 2014 to 2015 show that during March and April 2020 people were spending less time travelling, studying, doing housework and on personal care and more time sleeping and resting, entertaining and socialising, gardening and DIY, and working from home.</p>

<h2>Air quality</h2>

<p>Air quality data is available for London, Manchester and Birmingham. Improvements in air quality since the introduction of initial lockdown in March are mainly due to reductions in the concentration of the nitrogen oxide (<abbr title="nitrogen oxide">NO2</abbr>) in the environment. Data for <abbr title="nitrogen oxide">NO2</abbr> up to the end of November show that these values are generally lower than the same period in 2019.</p>

<h2>Grocery purchasing and food usage</h2>

<p>The volume of grocery purchases rose sharply just before lockdown on 23 March and volume sales are still higher up to and including the week ending 22 November than at the same point in 2019. Since the initial lockdown began and up to the week ending 22 November, shoppers have made fewer trips than in the same period last year but have been buying more per trip. There was an increase in grocery purchases in the week before and the first week of the second national lockdown that began on 5 November.  These patterns are seen across all socioeconomic groups.</p>

<p>Changes in food use behaviours were most visible among the younger age groups, households with children and those who were self-isolating. About half of 16 to 34 year olds changed their food use patterns between April and June while the habits of most of the older age groups remained consistent. There was a shift towards cooking more from scratch, eating together with the family and eating healthy meals, but also a marked increase in snacking, especially in April and May.</p>

<p>A more detailed analysis of the impact of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic on grocery shopping behaviours was published on 5 November.</p>

<h2>Alcohol, smoking, gambling and physical activity</h2>

<p>Alcohol intake across the population as a whole remained about the same during the first national lockdown, with almost half reporting that they had neither increased nor decreased their drinking, and this pattern continued as restrictions were eased. Those aged 18 to 34 were more likely to report consuming less alcohol than before, during all phases of social restrictions, and those aged 35 to 54 were more likely to report an increase. However, there was an increase in the proportion of ‘increasing and higher risk’ drinkers from April to September 2020. Alcohol purchasing rose sharply just prior to the first national lockdown and has remained higher up to 1 November 2020 than in the same weeks in 2019. This pattern is observed across all life stages and social classes. There was an increase in alcohol purchasing in the week preceding the start of the second national lockdown which began on 5 November.</p>

<p>Smoking prevalence in the 4-week period ending 5 July was lower than the 2019 baseline. Smoking prevalence for people aged 16 to 24 more than halved in the same 4 week period.  There has been an increase in the number of people attempting to quit smoking during the pandemic with two-fifths of smokers attempting to quit in the 3 months up to September 2020. Over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e-cigarettes remain the most commonly used aids to quitting. However, during the pandemic there has been a reduction in their use and a corresponding increase in people attempting to quit unaided.</p>

<p>The proportion of adults engaging in and spending money on all types of gambling, including betting and the lottery, decreased during the pandemic compared with before. This reduction continued once sports events and bookmakers reopened. This was seen across all age groups and both sexes.</p>

<p>In April and May, about a third of adults reported doing at least 30 minutes of physical 
activity on 5 or more days in the previous week. Since then, and up to the 3 August, there has been a decrease to slightly over a quarter of adults reporting this level of physical activity.</p>

<p>Around a third of adults reported doing more physical activity than usual during the lockdown period between 3 April and 11 May 2020, but over a third said they were doing less. Similarly, just under a third of parents reported that their children were doing more physical activity compared with before the initial lockdown, although just over a third said they were doing less.</p>

<h2>Access to care and hospital admissions</h2>

<p>Of those reporting that they had a worsening health condition during the week leading up to 26 September, just under a half reported that they have not sought advice for their condition. The most common reason for not doing so was to avoid putting pressure on the NHS.</p>

<p>There was a reduction in monthly elective and emergency hospital admissions in the period April to June 2020 in England compared with the monthly average for April to June in 2018 and 2019 combined. This pattern was observed in men and women, and across all age groups, ethnic groups and deprivation deciles.</p>

<h2>Cardiovascular disease</h2>

<p>During the pandemic, there has been a reduction in the number of emergency admissions to hospital with cardiovascular related conditions. Weekly admissions for acute coronary syndromes (including heart attacks) and stroke were lower during the first national lockdown compared with the average for 2018 and 2019. The pattern was seen in both men and women.  Reduced admissions during this period may result in increased out-of-hospital deaths, long-term complications and missed opportunities to provide secondary prevention treatment to patients.</p>

<h2>Impact on employment and businesses</h2>

<p>The rate of people per 1,000 employees who had been made redundant or took voluntary redundancy more than doubled from the quarter April to June 2020 to July to September 2020. The rate for July to September 2020 is also almost triple that of the same quarter in 2019. The proportion of those claiming unemployment benefits more than doubled between March and May and has remained at a similar level until October. These figures may not yet reflect the true impact of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Lockdown meant significant impacts on businesses in terms of turnover and impact on the workforce. In the 2-week period ending 31 May just over a fifth of the UK workforce was on furlough and just under a quarter of enterprises across all industries had experienced a decrease in turnover of more than 50%. Data for the period ending 1 November shows that the proportion of the UK workforce on furlough leave across all industries has decreased to under a tenth, as the initial lockdown restrictions were gradually relaxed and more businesses were able to reopen.</p>

<p>At the end of July 2020 the take-up rate of the furlough scheme was highest in those aged 16 to 24, of whom a little under a half of all eligible employees were on furlough leave, and lowest in those aged 45 to 54 of whom just over a quarter were on furlough leave. At the end of May 2020, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) take-up rate was 7 in 10. This dropped to 6 in 10 by the end of August.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy and birth</h2>

<p>Data shows that, compared with a monthly average baseline of combined data from April 2016 to March 2019, there was a decrease in the percentage of premature birth deliveries in England in April and May 2020, but was similar to baseline in June, July and August. There was no statistically significant differences in other outcomes compared with baseline, such as the percentage of deliveries with low or very low birthweight in England or the percentage of deliveries which included one or more stillbirths.</p>

<h2>Reproductive health</h2>

<p>The rate of GP prescribed long acting reversible contraception (LARC) was significantly lower at the beginning of the first national lockdown than the monthly average from 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019. Rates gradually increased from May to September but remain below this baseline nationally and in most regions.</p>

<h2>Crime</h2>

<p>There has been a reduction in many types of police-recorded crime between February 2020 and April 2020. Total crime fell by a third during this period and was a quarter lower in April 2020 than the same month in 2019. An exception to this pattern was drug offences, where levels rose between March and April 2020 and have continued to rise. Recorded figures for drug offences were over a fifth higher in April 2020 and over two-fifths higher in May 2020 compared with the same months in 2019.</p>

<p>During the period April to May, when asked about their perception of national crime and crime in their local area ‘since the virus outbreak’, over half perceived that national crime had gone down, whereas just under a half perceived that there had been no change in levels of crime in their local area.</p>

<p>About 8 in 10 adults reported that there had been no change in how much they worried about crime in general since the virus outbreak.</p>

<p>Around a fifth of adults perceived anti-social behaviour levels in their local area to have decreased during the pandemic period and a similar proportion reported experiencing or witnessing anti-social behaviour in the last 3 months. Over half of parents reported that their child aged 10 to 15 years old was spending 5 or more hours online, with more than 1 in 10 children spending 9 or 10 hours online during May and June 2020. Over a tenth of parents reported that their child had encountered one or more negative online experiences in the last month.</p>
