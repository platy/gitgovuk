<h2>Background</h2>

<p>From 8 March 2021, people in England started to see the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions as the government’s four-step roadmap offered a route back to a more normal life. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/moving-to-step-4-of-the-roadmap" class="govuk-link">‘Guidance on moving to step 4 of the roadmap’</a> that is published on GOV.UK</p>

<p>As the impact of the pandemic continue to be seen across society, the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>) recognises that some social distancing restrictions will continue to affect the way in which European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) projects are being delivered. We remain committed to working flexibly and pragmatically with all of our Delivery Partners and Funding Recipients to ensure stability in the delivery of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects.</p>

<p>Since April 2020 we have agreed a number of easements with the European Commission. Along with the other <abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Managing Authorities across the UK, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> England <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> continues to apply easements that will be of most benefit for its Programme, alongside the various UK Government support packages. Easements for the England <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme have been set out in this <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> document and are reviewed regularly.</p>

<p>As restrictions are relaxed, individual <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> are being closed down at an appropriate time and supporting communications are being used to notify <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects of any changes arising from their closure.</p>

<p>These communications include brief explanations against the closed <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> or act as a signpost to related <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents, such as <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Notes or guidance that is published on GOV.UK, that set out arrangements which apply as restrictions continue to be lifted. For some of the <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> there will be a reversion to pre-COVID-19 policies and processes. In other cases, there are revised arrangements that incorporate recent easements.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Funding Recipients, Delivery Partners and stakeholders are asked to regularly revisit this <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> document for the latest information and look out for links to and notifications about new <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Notes and guidance updates.</p>

<p>As at 20 December 2021 there are only two open Q&amp;As: Q1 Part 2, and Q25.</p>

<h3>Question 1– (updated 21/09/2021)</h3>

<h4>Can the Managing Authority confirm its position on the following staff cost issues that have arisen as a result of COVID-19?</h4>

<p><strong>1. Claiming salary costs for staff wholly employed on the project (in particular, the ability to claim for sick-pay and/or for periods of self-isolation).</strong></p>

<p>Staff cost issues are covered by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-national-eligibility-rules-and-programme-guidance" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules and Programme Guidance</a> published on GOV.UK. The main section being ‘Direct Staff Costs’.</p>

<p>Supporting information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07021-revisions-to-national-eligibility-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 070/21 Revisions to National Eligibility and Programme Guidance</a> published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p><strong>2. Claiming salary costs for project staff who do not work wholly on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, work a variable number of hours monthly and record hours worked on a timesheet who are self-isolating/ill due to COVID-19 and unable to work.</strong></p>

<p>The answer to question 1.1 also applies in these circumstances.</p>

<p>For staff who do not work wholly on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, where the Simplified Cost Option is used to establish an hourly rate, and for those who would usually declare the hours they work on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project on a timesheet (but as a result of COVID-19 no hours have been worked / recorded due to self-isolation/illness), projects should calculated the average hours an individual worked in the previous claim period (to the one currently being claimed).</p>

<p>Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 056/20 Update to Action Note 052/2020: Hourly rate salary costs for project staff who are self-isolating / ill due to COVID-19 and unable to work and who are working on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects that started after Q4 2019 claim period</a> for more detailed guidance.</p>

<p>If the staff member is a recent recruit and was not working for the project in any previous claim period, the project should calculate an average weekly hours figure by using the HR letter issued to the individual and should be prepared to show those calculations to an auditor should they be selected for future audit. This approach applies in the situation of an established project or a new project. More details are set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 056/20</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that the approach above and as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/0522020-1720-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolatingill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 052/2020</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 056/20</a> applies equally to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project staff who have an hourly rate set using either the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Cost Methodology 2 or <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Cost Methodology 3 (see <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/820361/038-19_SCO_Staff_Costs_Action_Note.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Action Note 038/19 Introduction of additional <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs Methodology for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projects</a> for further details).  <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 052/2020 was republished on 28 July 2020 to make this clearer.</p>

<p>Please note the process described above must not be used where the ‘fixed percentage’ rule is being used to calculate direct staff costs.</p>

<p>It should be noted that where an organisation receives Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) for project staff under these circumstances, the amount should be offset against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim.</p>

<h3>Question 2 – (CLOSED 03/08/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06621-use-of-electronic-signatures-within-esf-programme-grant-recipient-documentation-and-as-verification-evidence-from-esf-participants"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 066/21: Use of Electronic signatures within <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Grant Recipients documentation and as verification evidence from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants</a></p>

<h4>Many staff and partners are working from home/remote locations and we are unable to provide wet signatures for documents that require them. What arrangements are being put in place to address this issue?</h4>

<p>We have put in place alternative arrangements for the completion and processing of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Funding Agreements</li>
  <li>Memorandum of Understanding</li>
  <li>Funding Agreement Variations</li>
  <li>Memorandum of Understanding Variations</li>
  <li>Bank Details</li>
  <li>Change of Bank Details forms</li>
  <li>Claims (from Quarter 1 2020, until further notice)</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06621-use-of-electronic-signatures-within-esf-programme-grant-recipient-documentation-and-as-verification-evidence-from-esf-participants"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 066/21: Use of Electronic signatures within <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Grant Recipients documentation and as verification evidence from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants </a> sets out that this alternative arrangement allows projects to use electronic signatures when completing any of the above, until the end of the Programme.</p>

<p>If projects have returned any of the above documents to the Managing Authority since 9 March 2020, following the existing guidance, you may want to consider contacting the Managing Authority to ensure that the documentation has been received, due to the fact that they are continuing to work remotely at this time.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority may request that you re-submit your documents under the new contingency process once published, as we can no longer action paper forms.</p>

<p>(see also question 15)</p>

<h3>Question 3 – (CLOSED 21/09/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07021-revisions-to-national-eligibility-and-programme-guidance">Action Note 70/21: Revision to National Eligibility and Programme Guidance</a></p>

<h4>We have incurred cancellation and other costs related to event bookings that cannot go ahead – can they be treated as eligible expenditure?</h4>

<p>From 1st February 2020, where the activity was cancelled, costs can be considered as eligible expenditure and will need to be evidenced.</p>

<p>However, the following must be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the expenditure will not be considered eligible if there is an insurance contract in place and the project can claim the cost</li>
  <li>if a credit note has been issued, costs are not eligible</li>
  <li>the project should have exhausted all possibilities to claim the expenditure incurred by other means e.g. travel insurance</li>
  <li>if the project can obtain a partial repayment, only the remaining costs are eligible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 4 – (CLOSED 03/08/2021- superseded by Question 30)</h3>

<h4>The delivery/performance of our project, including the achievement of our outputs/ targets, is being significantly affected e.g. by reduced levels of participation; lack of new starters; having to cancel face to face/group sessions. Meanwhile, staff and related core costs still need to be paid. What measures can the Managing Authority put in place to allow an appropriate reduction in outputs/targets and continued payment of projects/delivery partners that are paid on an output related basis?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority recognises COVID-19 from the 1st February 2020 and that it may have significantly impacted organisation’s ability to deliver outputs and results within projects. The Managing Authority will discuss the impact on a case by case basis.  Projects should provide details of the impact of COVID-19 in the progress report submitted with your claim. In the meantime, costs for staff who continue to work on the project will be paid where the project can demonstrate they are eligible.</p>

<h3>Question 5 - (CLOSED 15/04/2021 - superseded by Question 29 - rephrased question and modified answer)</h3>

<h4>The project will underspend in 2020, will this money automatically be lost to the project?</h4>

<p>No. We recognise that as a result of the impact of COVID-19 it may not be possible for some projects to operate as normal and that this may impact on performance. In the situation of an underspend occurring as a direct result of the impact of COVID-19, we will work with you to re-profile finances. We will also consider extensions to end dates to allow projects to catch up (also see the response to Question 11 below). However, it is not necessary to submit a Project Change Request form at this point, we will contact you to confirm when this is needed.</p>

<h3>Question 6 – (CLOSED 03/08/2021)</h3>

<h4>What business continuity related guidance and or advice can the Managing Authority give to projects that rely significantly on group or face to face input and are adversely affected at this time, including the impact of limited resources?</h4>

<p>We realise these are unprecedented and challenging circumstances and that organisations are working hard to develop solutions that enable continued support to individuals and groups. We encourage you to seek to deliver as much support as possible to participants taking into account the latest Government advice.</p>

<h3>Question 7 – (CLOSED 23/06/2021)</h3>

<h4>My project has been approved and a Funding Agreement has been issued. I have significant reservations about starting my project at this time and wish to review the options available. What does the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority advise?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority has arrangements in place to contact all applicants who have been issued a Funding Agreement which has not yet been signed  / returned. For such applicants, the Managing Authority will work with the applicant to determine whether they wish to continue with signing the Funding Agreement and or they wish to delay the start date of the contract. However, applicants should note that all projects must still be financially completed by 31 December 2023.</p>

<h3>Question 8 – (CLOSED 23/06/2021)</h3>

<h4>What arrangements are in place for Calls currently live on GOV.UK?</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> calls are published on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/european-structural-investment-funds"><abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Funding Finder</a>.  Organisations seeking <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding are advised to regularly access the website by following the link above.</p>

<h3>Question 9 – (CLOSED 27/05/2021)</h3>

<p>see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06321-confirming-arrangements-for-the-esf-project-change-request-extension-and-additional-funding-process-to-replace-open-calls" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 063/21: Confirming arrangements for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project Change Request extension and additional funding process to replace Open Calls</a>.</p>

<h4>What is happening with Calls that are expected to be launched in the future?</h4>

<p>It remains a key priority for the Programme that support to vulnerable people and other target groups is provided swiftly, whilst focusing on the potential to commit all remaining <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> funds by the end of 2021.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>) wrote to ESI Funds Sub-Committee Chairs seeking their views on how the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme can best support local areas to deliver their economic plans. Based on their feedback, on 23 February 2021 the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> wrote to local areas once more to confirm that the open Calls approach, including the Reserve Fund Call Proposal process, had ceased with immediate effect. From that point onwards, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> would use the existing Project Change Request (PCR) process, without the need for a corresponding open Call, for existing ‘well performing’ projects to apply for additional funds, as this approach will enable the MAs goal of providing support to Society more swiftly.</p>

<p>On 30 March 2021 the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06321-confirming-arrangements-for-the-esf-project-change-request-extension-and-additional-funding-process-to-replace-open-calls"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 063/21: ‘Confirming the arrangements for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project Change Request extension and additional funding process to replace Open Calls</a></p>

<p>Existing projects who wish to submit a PCR for their project to extend provision and or request additional funding will need to demonstrate the extent to which they meet the criteria set out in Action Note 063/21, by completing and submitting a PCR Self-Assessment Checklist along with a completed PCR Application Form. Details of how to  request these documents are set out in the Action Note. Such projects are invited to submit these documents to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> by 7 May 2021. Unfortunately, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will not be able to consider any PCRs requesting additional funding received after this date.</p>

<p>Please note that all current live calls will close in line with the published closure date.  Final calls agreed that have already been approved through the Reserve Fund process will be published as planned.</p>

<h3>Question 10 - (CLOSED 27/05/2021)</h3>

<h4>What is happening with project applications that have been submitted to the Managing Authority?</h4>

<p>Any  application which have been submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> are being progressed through the appraisal process under business as usual arrangements. A <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> representative will be in touch in due course to confirm the approach and outline timings.</p>

<h3>Question 11 - (CLOSED 03/08/2021 - superseded by Question 30)</h3>

<h4>Where activity is significantly delayed or ceased as a result of COVID-19 disruption, has consideration been given to extending projects?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will review any request for time only project extensions on a case by case basis. This includes extension requests from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects or applicants to extend their activity beyond the ‘duration of approved projects’ as set out in Section 2 of the respective <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Call for which they have responded.  However, it is important to note that all projects must be financially completed (for example, have a proposed Financial Completion date and all project costs defrayed) by 31 December 2023.</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 063/21: ‘Confirming arrangements for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Project Change Request extension and additional funding process to replace Open Calls’ published on 30 March 2021 does not impact on this process (see <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> 9 above). The Action Note describes a process to increase a project’s funding as well as extending the end date, which is separate from the process described in the paragraph above.</p>

<h3>Question 12 - (CLOSED 21/09/2021)</h3>

<p>See [<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 071/21 Reversal of COVID-19 Easements: Recommencement of Visits to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projects[(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07121-reversal-of-covid-19-easements-recommencement-of-visits-to-esf-projects)</p>

<h4>How does the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority plan to deliver Project Inception Visits (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIVs</abbr>) - given the current “social distancing” measures in the UK?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority recognise that it is not possible to visit premises during this time and so will carry out ‘virtual’ <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIVs</abbr> – through a combination of emails and telephone calls until further notice.</p>

<h3>Question 13 - (CLOSED 20/12/2021)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06821-future-esf-programme-delivery-arrangements-including-the-direct-bid-claims-process-which-apply-from-quarter-3-2021" class="govuk-link">See <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 068/21 Future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Delivery arrangements, including the Direct Bid claims process which applies from Quarter 3 2021.</a></p>

<h4>What arrangements are the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority putting in place to help speed up paying claims which have not already been submitted?</h4>

<p>For claims from Q1 2020, up to and including Q2 2021, projects will be paid in advance of checks being completed. On receipt of the claim, payment will be made, following which, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Managers will carry out checks and will select a list of transactions for sampling. The claim will then be cleared once the project provides evidence against those samples.</p>

<p>For Q3 2021 claims onwards however, projects are to note that in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06821-future-esf-programme-delivery-arrangements-including-the-direct-bid-claims-process-which-apply-from-quarter-3-2021"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 068/21 ‘Future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Delivery arrangements, including the Direct Bid claims process which applies from Quarter 3 2021’ </a> published on 29 July 2021 the Managing Authority is now removing these easements, and reverting back to the pre-COVID-19 published claims process.’</p>

<h3>Question 14 - (CLOSED 20/12/2021)</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06821-future-esf-programme-delivery-arrangements-including-the-direct-bid-claims-process-which-apply-from-quarter-3-2021">See <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 068/21 Future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Delivery arrangements, including the Direct Bid claims process which applies from Quarter 3 2021.</a></p>

<h4>We are delivering a Direct bid <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project. What happens if we are paid for a claim ‘in advance of the checks being completed’ but subsequently encounter problems in providing the necessary evidence?</h4>

<p>Projects should take all reasonable steps to submit a compliant claim.</p>

<p>However, in recognition that government COVID-19 advice may have made providing evidence for our usual checks challenging,  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06821-future-esf-programme-delivery-arrangements-including-the-direct-bid-claims-process-which-apply-from-quarter-3-2021" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 068/21 ‘Future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Delivery arrangements, including the Direct Bid claims process which applies from Quarter 3 2021’ </a> published on 29 July 2021 is offering Grant Recipients the opportunity to review their systems and processes in respect of all claims which were paid by the Managing Authority under the easements process. Projects have until 29 October 2021 to submit Self-Declared Adjustments to the Managing Authority in respect of costs where they have now established, for example that the supporting evidence is not available, or other errors in the claim are identified.</p>

<p>This is not withstanding any Article 127 activity. Where a project has been notified that a claim is subject to an A127 audit, Self-Declared Adjustments cannot be submitted in respect of any errors detected on that claim after the date the Managing Authority is notified of the Audit unless there is evidence that the Grant Recipient has previously notified the Managing Authority of their intention to submit a Self –Declared Adjustment for the error. Self-Declared Adjustments submitted to the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> in respect of missing evidence and/or information after this date will be treated as Irregularities.</p>

<p>The Irregularities, Technical/Clerical Adjustments and Self-Declared Adjustments process will continue to apply to off-set expenditure against future claims by Direct bid <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects. The Managing Authority will consider any issues, on a case by case basis for projects affected by COVID-19 but the existing procedures and checks which includes the process for identifying irregularities may still apply.</p>

<h3>Question 15 - (CLOSED 03/08/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06621-use-of-electronic-signatures-within-esf-programme-grant-recipient-documentation-and-as-verification-evidence-from-esf-participants"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 066/21: Use of Electronic signatures within <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Grant Recipients documentation and as verification evidence from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants</a></p>

<h4>How can my project meet the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme’s requirements for ‘wet signatures’ given the restrictions on ‘face to face’ work with participants that have arisen due to COVID-19 restrictions?</h4>

<p>Under normal circumstances, projects are required to have ‘wet’ signatures from participants, on both enrolment forms and any contact sheets, demonstrating they have received the support. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority recognises that this is not possible given current social distancing measures. From the 1st February 2020 participant verification can be provided by alternative means, such as email.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/06621-use-of-electronic-signatures-within-esf-programme-grant-recipient-documentation-and-as-verification-evidence-from-esf-participants" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 066/21: Use of Electronic signatures within <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme Grant Recipients documentation and as verification evidence from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants</a> sets out that this alternative arrangement allows projects to use electronic signatures when completing any of the above, until the end of the Programme.</p>

<p>(see also question 2)</p>

<h3>Question 16 - (CLOSED 21/09/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07121-reversal-of-covid-19-easements-recommencement-of-visits-to-esf-projects"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 071/21 Reversal of COVID-19 Easements: Recommencement of Visits to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projects</a></p>

<h4>My project was due an On the Spot Verification visit but this has been postponed, what happens?</h4>

<p>Due to the current restrictions on movement and travel, the Managing Authority cannot conduct any face to face On the Spot Verification Visits (<abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>). However, projects still remain subject to standard checks and audits.  Furthermore, evidence must still be retained in line with document retention policy and be made available when asked for. If a claim is selected for a <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> the Verification Team will adopt a desk- based approach, evidence requirements will be the same as if a face to face <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> was taking place. The evidence requested will need to be submitted electronically to the Managing Authority. However, if evidence cannot be sent electronically, the <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> will be paused until such time the evidence can be provided.</p>

<h3>Question 17 - (CLOSED 21/09/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07121-reversal-of-covid-19-easements-recommencement-of-visits-to-esf-projects"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 071/21 Reversal of COVID-19 Easements: Recommencement of Visits to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projects</a></p>

<h4>My Project is due to close and I haven’t yet had my On the Spot Visit, what happens now?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will pay your final claim, however due to the current restrictions the Verification team will conduct a desk-based On the Spot Verification Visit (<abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>). Projects must retain all evidence in line with document retention policy requirements and must make it available when asked for.</p>

<h3>Question 18 - (CLOSED 25/03/2021 - see question 28)</h3>

<h4>Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> be used to meet part of the 20% employer contribution to wage costs under the new extended Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme that was announced on 31 October 2020?</h4>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) is being extended until the end of April 2021. The level of the grant will mirror levels available under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> in August, so the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500 and employers will pay employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and pension contributions only for the hours the employee does not work.</p>

<p>Where project delivery has ceased and employers seek access to support under the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> will not contribute towards salary costs. This response also applies to employers with Intermediate Labour Market participants who are furloughed.</p>

<p>Please see Question 28 below in response to the revised terms of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>

<h3>Question 19 - (CLOSED 27/05/2021)</h3>

<h4>Is the Managing Authority able to provide any easements to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding requirements?</h4>

<p>We recognise that projects’ ability to access match funding may be impacted by COVID-19. The European Commission have confirmed that programmes can, for their current financial year only (July 2020 – June 2021), operate projects on a 100% intervention rate, however, significant restrictions apply, including the end date by which all activity must be complete.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority has consulted with Partners to identify options to implement the easement which will maximise the potential to fund support to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

<p>As a result of the consultation, the Managing Authority has created Priority Axis 4 ‘COVID-19 Response’ in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Operational Programme and on 3 September 2020, published a £5m ‘Lump Sum Digital Interventions’ Call on GOV.UK under a new Investment Priority 4.1. This call closed on 1st October 2020.</p>

<h3>Question 20 - (CLOSED 23/06/2021)</h3>

<h4>I would like to refocus my project in response to the impact of the COVID-19 situation in my local area. Can I do that?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will consider requests from projects to refocus support. Where the original Call included the types of activity now proposed in response to COVID-19, projects should approach their Contract Manager to discuss their proposal. Where the original Call did not provide for that additional activity, or the refocus is for longer than six months, the Managing Authority will consider the request, but may also seek advice from the local <abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Sub-Committee regarding the ‘strategic fit’ element of the proposal.</p>

<p>In addition, if the original call specification was developed in partnership with a Devolved Intermediate Body, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will liaise with them to agree the best approach with regard to seeking advice from a <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> Area <abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Sub-Committee.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects should note that re-purposing cannot include:</p>

<p>a)	activities which would duplicate existing provision, or</p>

<p>b)	activities which would contradict, duplicate or undermine HM Government domestic initiatives.</p>

<p>The above only sets out the broad framework under which re-purposing will be considered: it does not guarantee that your proposal will be approved.</p>

<h3>Question 21 - (CLOSED 27/05/2021)</h3>

<h4>Will there be any amendment to the Eligibility Rules to allow projects to purchase additional items (such as laptops and phones) to allow them to support their staff who are now working remotely to continue provide support to participants?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority recognises that projects are urgently needing to find alternative methods to ensure they can continue to deliver support, which necessitate buying additional items such as IT equipment. The current <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Eligibility Rules already allow for the purchase of single items below £1,000. Projects are reminded that any items purchased are for the sole use of project staff (not for use by participants) and will be required to provide evidence of any additional items purchased.</p>

<h3>Question 22 - (CLOSED 23/06/2021)</h3>

<h4>What flexibilities will the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority be making to commercial payment arrangements in light of the COVID-19 outbreak?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority has now received clarification regarding projects that have been procured under commercial terms and are now seeking to change their payment model, for example, where a project wishes to move away from a ‘Payment by Result’ payment model, to a ‘Cost based’ model.</p>

<p>The European Commission has confirmed that the COVID-19 emergency constitutes circumstances that a diligent contracting authority could not foresee. This means that provided the other conditions of the contract are fulfilled, changing the payment model during the life cycle of the contracts would be lawful, and it would remain eligible for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support.  However, the following conditions must be observed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the modification cannot alter the overall nature of the contract; and</li>
  <li>any increase in price is not higher than 50% of the value of the original contract or framework agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>Where several successive modifications are made, that limitation shall apply to the value of each modification. Such consecutive modifications shall not be aimed at circumventing these conditions.</p>

<p>Further advice for contracting authorities can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/procurement-policy-notes#2020">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/procurement-policy-notes#2020</a></p>

<h3>Question 23 - (CLOSED 03/08/2021)</h3>

<h3>What is the Managing Authority’s position on the Temporary Framework for State Aid in response to COVID-19 that has been adopted by the European Commission?</h3>

<p>The European Commission has adopted a series of flexibilities under CRII/ CRII+, including the Temporary Framework for State Aid in response to the current COVID-19 emergency. This is a temporary flexibility at a de minimis level only, which was initially due to expire on 31 December 2020, but has been extended to 30 June 2021 by the European Commission.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority considered whether the Temporary Framework for State Aid measures available should be applied to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme and concluded it would not be appropriate to use the Temporary Framework for State Aid for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision for the reasons outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the de minimis exemption limit was the same as it was prior to the Coronavirus flexibilities being introduced, and remains at EUR 200,000 over a 3 year rolling period</li>
  <li>there is a new threshold for expenditure of up to EUR 800,000 was aimed at remedying the liquidity shortage faced by undertakings and ensuring that disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak did not undermine their viability</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority does not directly support companies, instead the focus of the programme is on supporting skills and therefore it is not appropriate to use <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> to support company liquidity as envisaged in the Framework</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05120-temporary-easement-to-state-aid-de-minimis-level" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 051/20</a> has been updated to reflect that the temporary arrangement has been extended.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the adoption of the Temporary Framework is not a signal that the Commission has suspended or relaxed wider State Aid rules due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<h3>Question 24 - (CLOSED 21/09/2021)</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07021-revisions-to-national-eligibility-and-programme-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 070/21 Revisions to National Eligibility and Programme Guidance</a></p>

<h4>Many of my project staff are now working from home. Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> help towards paying a working from home allowance?</h4>

<p>Any weekly home-working cannot be considered as an eligible cost for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr></p>

<h3>Question 25 - (updated 20/12/2021)</h3>

<h4>Can the Managing Authority confirm which postcodes should be used to record <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> activity that is being conducted remotely?</h4>

<p>Where <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> delivery is being conducted remotely due to the impact of COVID-19, in the majority of cases projects should use the postcode recorded on the Funding Agreement (for their physical base in the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area) as the delivery postcode on the Grant Recipients data storage system (or for the ESFA CFO - Individual Learning Record (<abbr title="Individual Learning Record">ILR</abbr>)). This will ensure that remote activity, such as virtual staff working from home, that is delivered under the Funding Agreement and directly benefits the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area under which the Funding Agreement sits, can be considered eligible.</p>

<p>Grant Recipients should follow the published Participant Data Schema Guidance. This can be found here - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-claim-applications-and-self-declared-adjustments"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim applications and Self-Declared Adjustments</a> published on GOV.UK</p>

<p>This COVID-19 easement measure will apply until the Managing Authority publishes revised guidance on postcodes, within the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participant Data Schema guidance on GOV.UK, which will address the increased use of remote working / delivery by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects.</p>

<p>If a new temporary postcode is used under this easement, it must be one which falls in the same Category of Region as your project is delivering in, otherwise ECLAIMS will not validate your Participant Data Schema.</p>

<h3>Question 26 – (CLOSED 03/08/2021)</h3>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-data-evidence-requirements-eligibility-and-results" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and results</a> guidance.</p>

<h4>How can my project verify / certify an individual’s eligibility for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> if they cannot currently provide me with a hard or certified copy of their birth certificate /passport (or any other necessary documentation)?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority is aware that due to the impact of COVID-19, it may not always be possible for participants to provide projects with original documents or certified hard copies of the preferred evidence for eligibility at the point of enrolment. Projects that are unable to access this evidence directly from the participant should follow the 4-step methodology for checking evidence as set out in the Managing Authority’s  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents/esf-data-evidence-requirements-eligibility-and-results">‘<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and results’</a> guidance.</p>

<p>If self-declarations are required, then these can be made electronically via e-mail. Working through the 4-step methodology, projects may wish to supplement any self-declaration with additional alternative evidence as set out in the data evidence guidance, where they feel this also supports/gives credence to the individual’s application to join <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, providing the individual is willing to share such information.</p>

<p>Projects should always aim to obtain the best eligibility evidence they can from participants and should ask them to provide certified hard copies of evidence of the relevant documentation when it becomes possible to do so. If any 4-step methodology has to be undertaken, it should be completed before the eligible costs of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> activity (for the participant in question) are declared and the full evidence should be provided at a later date.</p>

<p>Please note that Question 15 of this Q and A guidance also covers handling of wet signatures or electronic signatures from participants.</p>

<h3>Question 27 (CLOSED 27/05/2021)</h3>

<h4>Are young people (including those aged 15) who have left education early as a direct result of COVID-19, eligible to receive Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) support?</h4>

<p>A young person in year 11 or 13, who due to the impact of COVID-19 has finished education earlier than expected and where they are not returning to education is eligible and can access <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> support, where they reside in an eligible <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> area. A young person expecting to return to education in September, cannot be classed as not in education, employment or training (<abbr title="Not in educations, employment or training">NEET</abbr>) and therefore will not be eligible for <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> support.</p>

<h3>Question 28 - (CLOSED 20/12/2021)</h3>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ended on 30 September 2021.</p>

<h4>Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> be used to meet the revised employer contribution to wage costs under the revised Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?</h4>

<p>On 3 March 2021 the Government announced that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a> has been extended until 30 September 2021 and the level of grant available to employers under the scheme will remain unchanged until 30 June 2021, as which point the level of grant will be reduced and employers will be asked to contribute towards the cost of your furlough employees’ wages.</p>

<p>Where project delivery has ceased and employers seek access to support under the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> may not be used to contribute towards salary costs. This response also applies to employers with Intermediate Labour Market participants who are furloughed.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme allows furloughed staff to return to work on a part time basis. Where an employee returns to work a reduced number of hours (and therefore receives a reduced salary), the employer will be able to claim salary costs for the hours the employee works on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project in a proportionate way.</p>

<p>Employers should ensure they follow the rules in place for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and only claim from the Managing Authority for the hours the employee works and not for the time spent by employees on furlough. Until an employee returns to the hours of work in place before the COVID-19 pandemic, they will be classed as furloughed for the hours they do not work on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project.</p>

<h3>Question 29 - (CLOSED 03/08/2021 - superseded by Question 30)</h3>

<p>This question supersedes Question 5.</p>

<h4>Due to the lockdowns, my project will underspend - will this money automatically be lost to the project?</h4>

<p>No. The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> recognises that as a result of the impact of COVID-19 it may not be possible for projects to operate as normal and that this may impact on performance. In the situation whereby an underspend occurs as a direct result of the impact of COVID-19, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will work with you to re-profile finances. It will also consider extensions to the end dates to allow projects to catch up (also see the response to Question 11 above). However, it is not necessary to submit a Project Change Request form at this point, as the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will contact you to confirm when this is required.</p>

<h3>Question 30 – (CLOSED 20/12/2021)</h3>

<p>This question supersedes Questions 4, 11 and 29.</p>

<h4>The delivery and performance of my <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 related disruption. How is the Managing Authority working with projects to address and manage the effects of that disruption and ensure continued delivery?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority recognises that COVID-19 has impacted projects from as early as February 2020 and that the pandemic, including lockdown measures and other restrictions still affect some aspects of project delivery. We are aware impacts have included reduced levels of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participation and achievement of outputs/targets against profile; and underspends when claims have been submitted.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, through easements and other measures set out in this <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> COVID-19 Response <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr>, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Notes and direct communications with projects, we have been working flexibly and pragmatically with Funding Recipients and Delivery Partners to ensure stability in the delivery of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority will work with Grant Recipients to determine the most appropriate and achievable way to manage under achievement of finance and outputs/targets against profile. Projects should therefore engage with their individual Contract Manager to agree the most appropriate way forward.</p>
