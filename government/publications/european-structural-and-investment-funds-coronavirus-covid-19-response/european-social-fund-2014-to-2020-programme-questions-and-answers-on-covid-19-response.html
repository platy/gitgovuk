<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The ongoing response to the COVID-19 crisis creates significant challenges for us all. We are in an unprecedented situation and with the England wide lockdown announced on 4 January 2021, there continues to be wide-ranging impacts across the wider community.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority recognises that this continues to affect the way in which European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) projects are being delivered. We remain committed to working flexibly and pragmatically with all of our Delivery Partners and Funding Recipients to ensure stability in the short term, allow projects to respond positively to the challenges we face as a nation and to ensure capacity is in place to support economic recovery once the current situation subsides.</p>

<p>The European Commission’s Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) continues to provide a welcome package of flexibilities for the use of European Structural and Investment Funds in response to the economic impacts of COVID-19. Measures to vary ESI Funds intervention rates, spending levels in Priority Axes and other flexibilities, such as the release of existing €8bn of ESI Funds pre-financing, provides a range of opportunities for different sets of circumstances in the UK and individual EU Member States.</p>

<p>Since April 2020 we have agreed a number of easements with the European Commission. Along with Managing Authorities across the UK we continue to consider opportunities that will be of most benefit for each programme, alongside the Government’s support package.</p>

<p>Many of you have raised questions and queries about the continued delivery of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme. As further information becomes available, the Managing Authority will update and add to the <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> responses below.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Funding Recipients, Delivery Partners and stakeholders are asked to regularly revisit this <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> document for the latest information.</p>

<h3>Question 1– (updated 12/01/2021)</h3>

<h4>Can the Managing Authority confirm its position on the following staff cost issues that have arisen as a result of COVID-19?</h4>

<p><strong>1. Claiming salary costs for staff wholly employed on the project (in particular, the ability to claim for sick-pay and/or for periods of self-isolation).</strong></p>

<p>In line with the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> National Eligibility Rules, the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority can reimburse sick (or maternity) pay that is claimed if it is in line with the organisations’ staff policy or on the individual’s contract of employment. Alternatively, an organisation may claim for replacement staff costs but only if sick (or maternity) pay is not being claimed.</p>

<p>We recognise that projects need clarification on submitting claims for people who need to self-isolate for a period of time – if an organisation intends to provide their staff with sick pay, they can submit a claim for salary costs for a period of self-isolating as per their policy or contract with the employee. If the organisation does not provide sick pay, then Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) would need to be considered for periods of self-isolation.</p>

<p>It should be noted that where an organisation receives <abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr> for project staff under these circumstances, the amount should be offset against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim.</p>

<p><strong>2. Claiming salary costs for project staff who do not work wholly on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, work a variable number of hours monthly and record hours worked on a timesheet who are self-isolating/ill due to COVID-19 and unable to work.</strong></p>

<p>The answer to question 1.1 also applies in these circumstances.</p>

<p>In addition, for staff who do not work wholly on an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project, where the Simplified Cost Option is used to establish an hourly rate, and for those who would usually declare the hours they work on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project on a timesheet (but as a result of COVID-19 no hours have been worked / recorded due to self-isolation/illness), projects should calculated the average hours an individual worked in a quarterly period, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Projects operating during the Quarter 4 2019 claim period should continue to use the claim for the Quarter 4 2019 claim period for Quarter 2 2020 claims onwards, covering absences from 1 April 2020. More details are set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/0522020-1720-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolatingill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 052/2020 Hourly rate salary costs for project staff who are self-isolating / ill due to COVID-19 and unable to work</a>. This will avoid organisations being disadvantaged due to the impact of COVID-19.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projects that were not operating during Quarter 4 2019 should use an average of the hours worked in the previous claim period (to the one currently being claimed). More details are also set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 056/20 Update to Action Note 052/2020: Hourly rate salary costs for project staff who are self-isolating / ill due to COVID 19 and unable to work and who are working on <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects that started after Q4 2019 claim period</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the staff member is a recent recruit and was not working for the project in any previous claim period, the project should calculate an average weekly hours figure by using the HR letter issued to the individual and should be prepared to show those calculations to an auditor should they be selected for future audit. This approach applies in the situation of an established project or a new project. More details are set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 056/20</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the approach above and as described in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/0522020-1720-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolatingill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 052/2020</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05620-update-to-action-note-0522020-hourly-rate-salary-costs-for-project-staff-who-are-self-isolating-ill-due-to-covid-19-and-unable-to-work-and" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 56/20</a> applies equally to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project staff who have an hourly rate set using either the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Cost Methodology 2 or <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Cost Methodology 3 (see <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/820361/038-19_SCO_Staff_Costs_Action_Note.pdf" class="govuk-link">Action Note 038/19 Introduction of additional <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Direct Staff Costs Methodology for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Projects</a> for further details).  <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 052/2020 was republished on 28 July 2020 to make this clearer.</p>

<p>Please note the process described above must not be used where the ‘fixed percentage’ rule is being used to calculate direct staff costs.</p>

<p>It should be noted that where an organisation receives Statutory Sick Pay (<abbr title="Statutory Sick Pay">SSP</abbr>) for project staff under these circumstances, the amount should be offset against the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> claim.</p>

<h3>Question 2 – (updated 18/08/2020)</h3>

<h4>Many staff and partners are working from home/remote locations and we are unable to provide wet signatures for documents that require them. What arrangements are being put in place to address this issue?</h4>

<p>We have put in place temporary contingency arrangements for the completion and processing of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Funding Agreements</li>
  <li>Memorandum of Understanding</li>
  <li>Funding Agreement Variations</li>
  <li>Memorandum of Understanding Variations</li>
  <li>Bank Details</li>
  <li>Change of Bank Details forms</li>
  <li>Claims (from Quarter 1 2020, until further notice)</li>
</ul>

<p>This contingency arrangement allows projects to use electronic signatures when completing any of the above, until further notice.  For quarterly claim periods prior to Q1 2020, projects should continue to submit claims following the normal (pre COVID-19) claim processes. However, in cases where this is not possible, projects should contact the Managing Authority.</p>

<p>If projects have returned any of the above documents to the Managing Authority since 9 March 2020, following the existing guidance, you may want to consider contacting the Managing Authority to ensure that the documentation has been received, due to the fact that they are continuing to work remotely at this time.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority may request that you re-submit your documents under the new contingency process once published, as we can no longer action paper forms.</p>

<p>(see also question 15)</p>

<h3>Question 3 – (updated 08/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>We have incurred cancellation and other costs related to event bookings that cannot go ahead – can they be treated as eligible expenditure?</h4>

<p>From 1st February 2020, where the activity was cancelled, costs can be considered as eligible expenditure and will need to be evidenced.</p>

<p>However, the following must be taken into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the expenditure will not be considered eligible if there is an insurance contract in place and the project can claim the cost</li>
  <li>if a credit note has been issued, costs are not eligible</li>
  <li>the project should have exhausted all possibilities to claim the expenditure incurred by other means e.g. travel insurance</li>
  <li>if the project can obtain a partial repayment, only the remaining costs are eligible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 4 – (updated 09/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>The delivery/performance of our project, including the achievement of our outputs/ targets, is being significantly affected e.g. by reduced levels of participation; lack of new starters; having to cancel face to face/group sessions. Meanwhile, staff and related core costs still need to be paid. What measures can the Managing Authority put in place to allow an appropriate reduction in outputs/targets and continued payment of projects/delivery partners that are paid on an output related basis?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority recognises COVID-19 from the 1st February 2020 and that it may have significantly impacted organisation’s ability to deliver outputs and results within projects. The Managing Authority will discuss the impact on a case by case basis.  Projects should provide details of the impact of COVID-19 in the progress report submitted with your claim. In the meantime, costs for staff who continue to work on the project will be paid where the project can demonstrate they are eligible.</p>

<h3>Question 5 - (updated 21/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>The project will underspend in 2020, will this money automatically be lost to the project?</h4>

<p>No. We recognise that as a result of the impact of COVID-19 it may not be possible for some projects to operate as normal and that this may impact on performance. In the situation of an underspend occurring as a direct result of the impact of COVID-19, we will work with you to re-profile finances. We will also consider extensions to end dates to allow projects to catch up (also see the response to Question 11 below). However, it is not necessary to submit a Project Change Request form at this point, we will contact you to confirm when this is needed.</p>

<h3>Question 6 – (updated 08/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>What business continuity related guidance/advice can the Managing Authority give to projects that rely significantly on group or face to face input and are adversely affected at this time, including the impact of limited resources?</h4>

<p>We realise these are unprecedented and challenging circumstances and that organisations are working hard to develop solutions that enable continued support to individuals and groups. We encourage you to seek to deliver as much support as possible to participants taking into account the latest Government advice.</p>

<h3>Question 7 – (updated 21/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>My project has been approved and a Funding Agreement has been issued. I have significant reservations about starting my project at this time and wish to review the options available. What does the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority advise?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority has arrangements in place to contact all applicants who have been issued a Funding Agreement which has not yet been signed / returned. For such applicants, the Managing Authority will work with the applicant to determine whether they wish to continue with signing the Funding Agreement and/or they wish to delay the start date of the contract.</p>

<h3>Question 8 – (updated 18/08/2020)</h3>

<h4>What arrangements are in place for Calls currently live on GOV.UK?</h4>

<p>All <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> calls are published on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/european-structural-investment-funds"><abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Funding Finder</a>.  Organisations seeking <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding are advised to regularly access the website by following the link above.</p>

<h3>Question 9 – (updated 25/03/2021)</h3>

<h4>What is happening with Calls that are expected to be launched in the future?</h4>

<p>It remains a key priority for the Programme that support to vulnerable people and other target groups is provided swiftly, whilst focusing on the potential to commit all remaining <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> funds by the end of 2021.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Managing Authority (<abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr>) wrote to ESI Funds Sub-Committee Chairs seeking their views on how the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Programme can best support local areas to deliver their economic plans. Based on their feedback, on 23 February 2021 the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> wrote to local areas once more to confirm that the open Calls approach, including the Reserve Fund Call Proposal process, had ceased with immediate effect. From that point onwards, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> would use the existing Project Change Request (PCR) process, without the need for a corresponding open Call, for existing ‘well performing’ projects to apply for additional funds, as this approach will enable the MAs goal of providing support to Society more swiftly.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will be publishing an Action Note setting out the ‘well performing’ criteria projects need to meet in order to submit a PCR, along with details of all necessary arrangements by the end March 2021.</p>

<p>Please note that all current live calls will close in line with the published closure date.  Final calls agreed that have already been approved through the Reserve Fund process will be published as planned.</p>

<h3>Question 10 - (published 28/07/2020)</h3>

<h4>What is happening with project applications that have been submitted to the Managing Authority?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority has made contact with all existing applicants to discuss if they wish to continue with their application. All applications in a position to proceed are being progressed through the appraisal process under business as usual arrangements.</p>

<h3>Question 11 - (updated 21/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>Where activity is significantly delayed or ceased as a result of COVID-19 disruption, has consideration been given to extending projects?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will review any request for project extensions on a case by case basis. This includes extension requests from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects or applicants to extend their activity beyond the ‘duration of approved projects’ as set out in Section 2 of the respective <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Call for which they have responded.  However, it is important to note that all projects must be completed by 31 December 2023.</p>

<h3>Question 12 - (published 08/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>How does the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority plan to deliver Project Inception Visits (<abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIVs</abbr>) - given the current “social distancing” measures in the UK?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority recognise that it is not possible to visit premises during this time and so will carry out ‘virtual’ <abbr title="Project Inception Visit">PIVs</abbr> – through a combination of emails and telephone calls until further notice.</p>

<h3>Question 13 - (published 18/08/2020)</h3>

<h4>What arrangements are the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority putting in place to help speed up paying claims which have not already been submitted?</h4>

<p>For claims from Q1 2020, until further notice, projects will be paid in advance of checks being completed. On receipt of the claim, payment will be made, following which, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Contract Managers will carry out checks and will select a list of transactions for sampling. The claim will then be cleared once the project provides evidence against those samples.  However, should COVID-19 measures still not allow for this (e.g. due to a lack of physical access to the site) then the Managing Authority will note this point and will follow up when current restrictions are lifted. Projects are asked to note that we will not be able to pay projects in advance of need, or in advance of receiving a complete claim.</p>

<h3>Question 14 - (updated 28/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>We are delivering a Direct bid <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project. What happens if we are paid for a claim ‘in advance of the checks being completed’ but subsequently encounter problems in providing the necessary evidence?</h4>

<p>Projects should take all reasonable steps to submit a compliant claim but we do recognise that current government COVID-19 advice might make providing evidence for our usual checks challenging.</p>

<p>The Irregularities, Technical/Clerical Adjustments and Self-Declared Adjustments process will continue to apply to off-set expenditure against future claims by Direct bid <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects. The Managing Authority will consider any issues, on a case by case basis for projects affected by COVID-19 but the existing procedures and checks which includes the process for identifying irregularities may still apply.</p>

<h3>Question 15 - (published 18/08/2020)</h3>

<h4>How can my project meet the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme’s requirements for ‘wet signatures’ given the restrictions on ‘face to face’ work with participants that have arisen due to COVID-19 restrictions?</h4>

<p>Under normal circumstances, projects are required to have ‘wet’ signatures from participants, on both enrolment forms and any contact sheets, demonstrating they have received the support. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority recognises that this is not possible given current social distancing measures. From the 1st February 2020 participant verification can be provided by alternative means, such as email.</p>

<p>(see also question 2)</p>

<h3>Question 16 - (updated 09/06/2020)</h3>

<h4>My project was due an On the Spot Verification visit but this has been postponed, what happens?</h4>

<p>Due to the current restrictions on movement and travel, the Managing Authority cannot conduct any face to face On the Spot Verification Visits (<abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>). However, projects still remain subject to standard checks and audits.  Furthermore, evidence must still be retained in line with document retention policy and be made available when asked for. If a claim is selected for a <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> the Verification Team will adopt a desk- based approach, evidence requirements will be the same as if a face to face <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> was taking place. The evidence requested will need to be submitted electronically to the Managing Authority. However, if evidence cannot be sent electronically, the <abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr> will be paused until such time the evidence can be provided.</p>

<h3>Question 17 - (updated 19/05/2020)</h3>

<h4>My Project is due to close and I haven’t yet had my On the Spot Visit, what happens now?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will pay your final claim, however due to the current restrictions the Verification team will conduct a desk-based On the Spot Verification Visit (<abbr title="On The Spot Visit">OTSV</abbr>). Projects must retain all evidence in line with document retention policy requirements and must make it available when asked for.</p>

<h3>Question 18 - (Closed 25/03/2021 - see question 28)</h3>

<h4>Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> be used to meet part of the 20% employer contribution to wage costs under the new extended Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme that was announced on 31 October 2020?</h4>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) is being extended until the end of April 2021. The level of the grant will mirror levels available under the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> in August, so the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500 and employers will pay employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and pension contributions only for the hours the employee does not work.</p>

<p>Where project delivery has ceased and employers seek access to support under the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> will not contribute towards salary costs. This response also applies to employers with Intermediate Labour Market participants who are furloughed.</p>

<p>Please see Question 28 below in response to the revised terms of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>

<h3>Question 19 - (updated 6/10/2020)</h3>

<h4>Is the Managing Authority able to provide any easements to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding requirements?</h4>

<p>We recognise that projects’ ability to access match funding may be impacted by COVID-19. The European Commission have confirmed that programmes can, for their current financial year only (July 2020 – June 2021), operate projects on a 100% intervention rate, however, significant restrictions apply, including the end date by which all activity must be complete.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority has consulted with Partners to identify options to implement the easement which will maximise the potential to fund support to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic.</p>

<p>As a result of the consultation, the Managing Authority has created Priority Axis 4 ‘COVID-19 Response’ in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Operational Programme and on 3 September 2020, published a £5m ‘Lump Sum Digital Interventions’ Call on GOV.UK under a new Investment Priority 4.1. This call closed on 1st October 2020.</p>

<h3>Question 20 - (updated 04/08/2020)</h3>

<h4>I would like to refocus my project in response to the impact of the COVID-19 situation in my local area. Can I do that?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority will consider requests from projects to refocus support. Where the original Call included the types of activity now proposed in response to COVID-19, projects should approach their Contract Manager to discuss their proposal. Where the original Call did not provide for that additional activity, or the refocus is for longer than six months, the Managing Authority will consider the request, but may also seek advice from the local <abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Sub-Committee regarding the ‘strategic fit’ element of the proposal.</p>

<p>In addition, if the original call specification was developed in partnership with a Devolved Intermediate Body, the <abbr title="Managing Authority">MA</abbr> will liaise with them to agree the best approach with regard to seeking advice from a <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> Area <abbr title="European Structural Investment Fund">ESIF</abbr> Sub-Committee.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> projects should note that re-purposing cannot include:</p>

<p>a)	activities which would duplicate existing provision, or</p>

<p>b)	activities which would contradict, duplicate or undermine HM Government domestic initiatives.</p>

<p>The above only sets out the broad framework under which re-purposing will be considered: it does not guarantee that your proposal will be approved.</p>

<h3>Question 21 - (updated 09/06/2020)</h3>

<h4>Will there be any amendment to the Eligibility Rules to allow projects to purchase additional items (such as laptops and phones) to allow them to support their staff who are now working remotely to continue provide support to participants?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority recognises that projects are urgently needing to find alternative methods to ensure they can continue to deliver support, which necessitate buying additional items such as IT equipment. The current <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Eligibility Rules already allow for the purchase of single items below £1,000. Projects are reminded that any items purchased are for the sole use of project staff (not for use by participants) and will be required to provide evidence of any additional items purchased.</p>

<h3>Question 22 - (updated 28/04/2020)</h3>

<h4>What flexibilities will the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority be making to commercial payment arrangements in light of the COVID-19 outbreak?</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority has now received clarification regarding projects that have been procured under commercial terms and are now seeking to change their payment model, for example, where a project wishes to move away from a ‘Payment by Result’ payment model, to a ‘Cost based’ model.</p>

<p>The European Commission has confirmed that the COVID-19 emergency constitutes circumstances that a diligent contracting authority could not foresee. This means that provided the other conditions of the contract are fulfilled, changing the payment model during the life cycle of the contracts would be lawful, and it would remain eligible for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support.  However, the following conditions must be observed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the modification cannot alter the overall nature of the contract; and</li>
  <li>any increase in price is not higher than 50% of the value of the original contract or framework agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>Where several successive modifications are made, that limitation shall apply to the value of each modification. Such consecutive modifications shall not be aimed at circumventing these conditions.</p>

<h3>Question 23 - (Updated 02/02/2021)</h3>

<h3>What is the Managing Authority’s position on the Temporary Framework for State Aid in response to COVID-19 that has been adopted by the European Commission?</h3>

<p>The European Commission has adopted a series of flexibilities under CRII/ CRII+, including the Temporary Framework for State Aid in response to the current COVID-19 emergency. This is a temporary flexibility at a de minimis level only, which was initially due to expire on 31 December 2020, but has been extended to 30 June 2021 by the European Commission.</p>

<p>The Managing Authority considered whether the Temporary Framework for State Aid measures available should be applied to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> programme and concluded it would not be appropriate to use the Temporary Framework for State Aid for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> provision for the reasons outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the de minimis exemption limit was the same as it was prior to the Coronavirus flexibilities being introduced, and remains at EUR 200,000 over a 3 year rolling period</li>
  <li>there is a new threshold for expenditure of up to EUR 800,000 was aimed at remedying the liquidity shortage faced by undertakings and ensuring that disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak did not undermine their viability</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority does not directly support companies, instead the focus of the programme is on supporting skills and therefore it is not appropriate to use <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> to support company liquidity as envisaged in the Framework</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/05120-temporary-easement-to-state-aid-de-minimis-level"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Action Note 051/20</a> has been updated to reflect that the temporary arrangement has been extended.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the adoption of the Temporary Framework is not a signal that the Commission has suspended or relaxed wider State Aid rules due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<h3>Question 24 - (published 26/05/2020)</h3>

<h4>Many of my project staff are now working from home. Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> help towards paying the working from home allowance?</h4>

<p>The weekly home-working allowance referred to is provided as an existing HMRC tax relief and therefore cannot be considered as an eligible cost for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Question 25 - (updated 14/07/2020)</h3>

<h4>Can the Managing Authority confirm which postcodes should be used to record <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> activity that is being conducted remotely?</h4>

<p>Where <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> delivery is being conducted remotely due to the impact of COVID-19, in the majority of cases projects should use the postcode recorded on the Funding Agreement (for their physical base in the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area) as the delivery postcode on the Individual Learning Record (<abbr title="Individual Learning Record">ILR</abbr>). This will ensure that remote delivery, which may take place outside the <abbr title="Local Enterprise Partnership">LEP</abbr> area but relates to the Funding Agreement, can be considered eligible.</p>

<p>However, the Managing Authority is aware that there will be scenarios where the postcode on the Funding Agreement will not be where delivery usually takes place. Where this applies, projects should use the postcode of the outreach premises where, if it were not for the impact of COVID-19, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support would have been delivered. These measures are a temporary arrangement which will apply until the current restrictions on travel and movement are lifted.</p>

<p>Please note: The postcode eligibility requirement for the Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) still applies for example, for <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> the participant must live in a <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>-designated sub-region to be eligible for support.</p>

<h3>Question 26 – (published 09/06/2020)</h3>

<h4>How can my project verify / certify an individual’s eligibility for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> if they cannot currently provide me with a hard or certified copy of their birth certificate /passport (or any other necessary documentation)?</h4>

<p>The Managing Authority is aware that due to the impact of COVID-19, it may not always be possible for participants to provide projects with original documents or certified hard copies of the preferred evidence for eligibility at the point of enrolment. Projects that are unable to access this evidence directly from the participant should follow the 4-step methodology for checking evidence as set out in the Managing Authority’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835524/data_evidence_guidance.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and results guidance</a></p>

<p>If self-declarations are required, then these can be made electronically via e-mail. Working through the 4-step methodology, projects may wish to supplement any self-declaration with additional alternative evidence as set out in the data evidence guidance, where they feel this also supports/gives credence to the individual’s application to join <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, providing the individual is willing to share such information.</p>

<p>Projects should always aim to obtain the best eligibility evidence they can from participants and should ask them to provide certified hard copies of evidence of the relevant documentation when it becomes possible to do so. If any 4-step methodology has to be undertaken, it should be completed before the eligible costs of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> activity (for the participant in question) are declared and the full evidence should be provided at a later date.</p>

<p>Please note that Question 15 of this Q and A guidance also covers handling of wet signatures or electronic signatures from participants.</p>

<h3>Question 27 (published 30/06/2020)</h3>

<h4>Are young people (including those aged 15) who have left education early as a direct result of COVID-19, eligible to receive Youth Employment Initiative (<abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr>) support?</h4>

<p>A young person in year 11 or 13, who due to the impact of COVID-19 has finished education earlier than expected and where they are not returning to education is eligible and can access <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> support, where they reside in an eligible <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> area. A young person expecting to return to education in September, cannot be classed as not in education, employment or training (<abbr title="Not in educations, employment or training">NEET</abbr>) and therefore will not be eligible for <abbr title="Youth Employment Initiative">YEI</abbr> support.</p>

<h3>Question 28 - (updated 25/03/2021)</h3>

<h4>Can <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> be used to meet the revised employer contribution to wage costs under the revised Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?</h4>

<p>On 3 March 2021 the Government announced that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a> has been extended until 30 September 2021 and the level of grant available to employers under the scheme will remain unchanged until 30 June 2021, as which point the level of grant will be reduced and employers will be asked to contribute towards the cost of your furlough employees’ wages.</p>

<p>Where project delivery has ceased and employers seek access to support under the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> may not be used to contribute towards salary costs. This response also applies to employers with Intermediate Labour Market participants who are furloughed.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme allows furloughed staff to return to work on a part time basis. Where an employee returns to work a reduced number of hours (and therefore receives a reduced salary), the employer will be able to claim salary costs for the hours the employee works on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project in a proportionate way.</p>

<p>Employers should ensure they follow the rules in place for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and only claim from the Managing Authority for the hours the employee works and not for the time spent by employees on furlough. Until an employee returns to the hours of work in place before the COVID-19 pandemic, they will be classed as furloughed for the hours they do not work on the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> project.</p>
