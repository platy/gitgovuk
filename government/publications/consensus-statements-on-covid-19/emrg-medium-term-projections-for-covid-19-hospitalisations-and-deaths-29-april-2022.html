<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Secutity Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Epidemiology Modelling Review Group (EMRG) shares these medium-term projections (<abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>) for coronavirus (COVID-19) hospitalisations and deaths with thanks to <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling and reports">SPI-M-O</abbr>, who contribute model outputs for the combined projections (not all modelling groups produce projections for both hospitalisations and deaths).</p>

<h2>Medium-term projections</h2>

<ol>
  <li>These <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> for COVID-19 hospitalisations<sup>±</sup>  and deaths<sup>¥</sup>  are not forecasts or predictions. They represent a scenario in which the trajectory of the epidemic continues to follow the trends that were seen in data available to 11 April 2022.</li>
  <li>Several modelling groups produce their own set of projections. These <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spi-m-o-combining-covid-19-model-forecast-intervals-9-april-2020">individual projections are then combined</a>  to form consensus <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>. <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> are provided for England, Wales and Scotland, for <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-1">hospital admissions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-2">deaths</a>, as well as English <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-3">regional hospital admissions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-4">deaths</a>. Due to an insufficient number of models being available, it has not been possible to produce projections for Northern Ireland this week.</li>
  <li>The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means the <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> cannot fully reflect the impact of policy and behavioural changes made in the 2 to 3 weeks prior to 11 April 2022. An assumed effect of school holidays has been included.</li>
  <li>The projections include the impact of vaccines given over the next 4 weeks. It will take time for the continued rollout of doses to impact the epidemic, given lags between vaccination and protection, and between infection and hospital admission. Modelling groups have used their expert judgement and evidence from <abbr title="UK Health Secutity Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and other published studies when making assumptions about vaccine effectiveness.</li>
  <li>Projections do not include the potential effects of any novel variants. The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means it is unlikely that a novel variant will significantly alter the trajectories of hospitalisations and deaths in the timescales covered by these projections.</li>
</ol>

<p><sup>±</sup> These are new hospitalisations per day which incorporates both the number of individuals admitted with COVID-19, as well as inpatients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Data definitions differ slightly across all 4 nations.</p>

<p><sup>¥</sup> These are the number of new deaths per day (by date of death) that are within 28 days of being identified as a COVID-19 case. Data definitions differ slightly across all 4 nations.</p>
