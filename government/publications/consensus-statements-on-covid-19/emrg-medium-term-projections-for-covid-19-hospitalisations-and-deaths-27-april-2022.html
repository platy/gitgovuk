<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Epidemiology Modelling Review Group (<abbr title="Epidemiology Modelling Review Group">EMRG</abbr>) shares these medium-term projections (<abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>) for coronavirus (COVID-19) hospitalisations and deaths with thanks to <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group">SPI-M-O</abbr>, who contribute model outputs for the combined projections. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<h2>Medium-term projections</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>These medium-term projections (<abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>) for COVID-19 hospitalisations <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> and deaths  <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> are not forecasts or predictions. They represent a scenario in which the trajectory of the epidemic continues to follow the trends that were seen in data available to 25 April 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several modelling groups produce their own set of projections. These individual projections are then combined <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> to form consensus <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>. <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> are provided for England, Wales and Scotland, for <a class="govuk-link" href="#Figure-1a">hospital admissions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Figure-1d">deaths</a>, as well as <a class="govuk-link" href="#Figure-3a">English regional hospital admissions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Figure-4a">deaths</a>. Due to an insufficient number of models being available, it has not been possible to produce projections for deaths for Northern Ireland and Wales this week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means the <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> cannot fully reflect the impact of policy and behavioural changes made in the 2 to 3 weeks prior to 25 April 2022. An assumed effect of school holidays has been included.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modelling groups have used their expert judgement and evidence from the UK Health Security Agency and other published studies when making assumptions about vaccine effectiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projections do not include the potential effects of any novel variants. The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means it is unlikely that a novel variant will significantly alter the trajectories of hospitalisations and deaths in the timescales covered by these projections.</p>
  </li>
