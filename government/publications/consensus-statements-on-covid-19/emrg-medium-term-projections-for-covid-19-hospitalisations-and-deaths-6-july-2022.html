<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Epidemiology Modelling Review Group (<abbr title="Epidemiology Modelling Review Group">EMRG</abbr>) shares these medium-term projections (<abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>) for coronavirus (COVID-19) hospitalisations and deaths with thanks to <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M-O</abbr>, who contribute model outputs for the combined projections (not all modelling groups produce projections for both hospitalisations and deaths).</p>

<h3>Medium-term projections</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>These medium-term projections (<abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>) for COVID-19 hospitalisations <sup>±</sup> and deaths <sup>¥</sup> are not forecasts or predictions. They represent a scenario in which the trajectory of the epidemic continues to follow the trends that were seen in data available to 4 July 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several modelling groups produce their own set of projections. These individual <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spi-m-o-combining-covid-19-model-forecast-intervals-9-april-2020">projections are then combined</a> to form consensus <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr>. <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> are provided for England, Wales and Scotland, for hospital admissions (<a class="govuk-link" href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) (Insufficient models were available for Northern Ireland for a combined projection). <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> are provided for deaths for England (<a class="govuk-link" href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), and <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> are provided for English regional hospital admissions (<a class="govuk-link" href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of deaths is currently low in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and in the English regions. Projecting forwards is difficult when numbers fall to very low levels, therefore projections for deaths are not provided for these nations and regions this week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means the <abbr title="medium-term projections">MTPs</abbr> cannot&nbsp;fully reflect the impact&nbsp;of policy and behavioural changes in the 2 to 3 weeks prior to 4 July 2022.&nbsp;An assumed effect of school&nbsp;holidays has been included.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modelling groups have used their expert judgement and evidence from the UK Health Security Agency and other published studies when making assumptions about vaccine effectiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Projections do not include the potential effects of any novel variants. The delay between infection, developing symptoms, the need for hospital care, and death means it is unlikely that a novel variant will significantly alter the trajectories of hospitalisations and deaths in the timescales covered by these projections.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>± These are new hospitalisations per day which incorporates both the number of individuals admitted with COVID-19, as well as inpatients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Data definitions differ slightly across all 4 nations.</p>

<p>¥ These are the number of new deaths per day (by date of death) that are within 28 days of being identified as a COVID-19 case. Data definitions differ slightly across all 4 nations.</p>
