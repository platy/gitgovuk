<h2>Import of Frozen Beef and Veal Quota (GATT) under Statutory Instrument 2020 No. 1432</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This notice explains how the rules are applied to this quota and how to apply for a licence. It also advises you of the quota amount available in the May 2022 quota application window. The contents of this notice are intended as a guide only.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The remaining additional quantity which may be imported under these arrangements is 5,980,379kg of frozen beef and veal (expressed as boneless meat), falling within CN codes 0202 and 0206 2991, which must be frozen with an internal temperature of -12°C or lower. The Common Customs Tariff duty applicable to this quota is 20% ad valorem.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this quota, 100 kg of bone-in meat equates to 77 kg of boneless meat.</p>

<p>This quota will be managed by issuing import licences.</p>

<h2>Proof of Trade</h2>
<p>If this is your first application in the quota year you will need to provide proof that you imported at least 25 tonnes of frozen beef in the 12 month period ending 31 March 2021 (1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021).</p>

<p>In addition to the above you must be established and registered for VAT in the UK. You must provide us with a copy of your current VAT registration certificate.</p>

<p>The proof we require will be as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list of licence numbers (if the licence was issued in electronic format) and the quantities used; and</li>
  <li>Copies of C88 documents, stamped and signed by Customs as true and certified (if the licence was issued in paper format or the commodity is non-licensable).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If you are registered as part of a group, you must provide an up to date VAT certificate that lists each company within the group.</p>

<h2>Eligibility:</h2>
<p>To give us the maximum time possible to resolve any queries, please submit your proof documents and your GATT proofs log as soon as possible. This will allow us to check that the quantities are correct before you submit your licence application between 1st and 6th May 2022.</p>

<h2>Reference Quantity:</h2>
<p>You will also need to provide proof of your reference quantity which will determine how much quota you can apply for within the quota year. Imports under the following CN codes can qualify towards your reference quantity: 02010000, 02020000, 02061095 and 02062991. Imports must take place within the 12 month period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>For proof of trade and reference quantity, we will need to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Customs documents of release for free circulation for all paper licences, or if the product was imported without a licence. Each proof must be marked with a cross-reference to previous licences issued; and</li>
  <li>A copy of your current VAT certificate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If you are registered as part of a group, you must provide an up to date VAT certificate that lists each company within the group.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The reference quantity requirement has been removed for the remainder of the quota year. Applications can be submitted up to the maximum quantity available.</p>

<h2>Spreadsheet for Proof of Trade and Reference Quantity</h2>
<p>You will find a copy of the spreadsheets for the collation of proofs with this notice. Alternatively, you can contact the Imports team on the helpline telephone number given below.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List the licence numbers and attributions on the GATT spreadsheets that have been supplied;</li>
  <li>Ensure that the spreadsheets clearly state your trader name and RPA Trader Registration Number, in order to enable us to link them to your application form;</li>
  <li>Email the spreadsheets to trader@rpa.gov.uk (a hard copy is not necessary). For verification purposes, you must supply the original C88s or copies of the originals, stamped by Customs. We will accept photocopies of the Customs stamp or scanned versions of these documents on condition that you supply the originals at your earliest opportunity. These procedures do not apply to imports covered by an electronic licence, only to imports made using a paper licence or with no licence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying for a licence</h2>
<p>Quota applications must be received during the first seven days of May.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your application, all supporting documentation and your security, is correct at the time of submission. They must be received by the RPA no later than 5pm on 6 May 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  We will reject any applications where the security and / or proof of trade is received after 5pm on 6 May 2022.</p>

<p>We advise you to use the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agrim-import-licence-application-form-for-agricultural-products">application form</a>. You can submit applications either by post or by email. The email address for licence applications is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>As part of the GATT beef import tariff quota, licence applications must include the following entries:</p>

<p>Box 8 of your application must state the country of origin;<br>
Box 15, the full description, covering both CN codes in the group;<br>
Box 16, one of the following groups of CN codes:<br>
0202 1000, 0202 20 for bone-beef; or<br>
0202 30, 0206 2991 for boneless beef;<br>
Box 20, “frozen meat of bovine animals – Statutory Instrument No. 2020/1432” and order number “05.4003”.</p>

<p>If an amendment to your application or proof of trade is required, you will have 7 days after the application window closes to return the information. Failure to return the information within this period may result in your application being rejected.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Your licence application must be accompanied by a security of £60.00 per tonne. You can find further information on how to lodge your security by searching for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licence-securities-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">‘Licence securities for the import/export of agricultural products’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Issuing Licences</h2>
<p>As soon as the application period has closed, we will collate the details of all valid quota applications received and calculate the applicable reduction coefficient. The reduction coefficient details will be published on the gov.uk website and your licence will be issued electronically towards the end of April for use from 1 May 2022.</p>

<p>Import licences will be valid until the end of 2021/2022 quota period (30 June 2022). All licences will be issued electronically as they are valid for imports into the UK only.
