<h2>About the conference</h2>

<p>Ten years from the launch of the <abbr title="Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative">PSVI</abbr> and following the ground-breaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/sexual-violence-in-conflict">UK-hosted global summit in 2014</a> with former Foreign Secretary William Hague and Angelina Jolie, the UK will bring together foreign ministers, international organisations, faith and belief leaders, and civil society including survivors of sexual violence, to drive forward much-needed global action to tackle Conflict-Related Sexual Violence (<abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>).</p>

<p>Addressing <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr> is a top UK priority. Conflict-related sexual violence (<abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>) has shattered lives and scarred communities around the world. According to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auto-draft/SG-Report2021for-web.pdf" rel="external">12th Report of the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> Secretary General on <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr></a>, incidents continue to be reported in 18 countries in 2021. The horrific accounts of sexual violence by Russian forces in Ukraine are a further rallying call to the international community. While <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr> is prohibited under international law, prosecution levels are low, and impunity persists.</p>

<p>The conference will highlight ways to prevent <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>, improve justice and accountability for this crime, understand ways to better support survivors and children born of sexual violence in conflict and overall strengthen the global response to <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>.</p>

<p>We are exploring taking forward a new Political Declaration to help galvanise the international community and raise the bar to better prevent and respond to <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>, scoping options for strengthening national justice mechanisms and look to strengthen the international legal architecture including through the Crimes Against Humanity (CAH) Convention. The Conference will also promote the broader Women, Peace and Security agenda – highlighting the role of women in peace processes and humanitarian action and the link to lasting peace.</p>

<p>We will use the conference to drive international support and commitment for existing frameworks that keep survivor rights and wellbeing protected, including through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.muradcode.com/murad-code" rel="external">Murad Code</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ensuring-the-rights-and-wellbeing-of-children-born-of-sexual-violence-in-conflict-call-to-action">Call to Action to Ensure the Rights and Wellbeing of Children Born of Sexual violence in Conflict</a>. We will use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/declaration-of-humanity-by-leaders-of-faith-and-leaders-of-belief">Declaration of Humanity</a> and the key role that faith leaders can play in preventing sexual violence in conflict and supporting survivors to directly challenge false narratives and the hijacking of religion to perversely justify <abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative</h2>

<p>The UK is a global leader on action to tackle Conflict-Related Sexual Violence (<abbr title="Conflict-Related Sexual Violence">CRSV</abbr>), committing £50 million since <abbr title="Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative">PSVI</abbr>’s launch in 2012. This includes providing £2.7 million to the Global Survivors Fund since its launch in 2019. We also have trained over 17,000 police and military personnel and deployed the UK’s Team of Experts on <abbr title="Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative">PSVI</abbr> over 90 times since 2012 to build capacity of governments, the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr> and <abbr title="non-governmental organisations">NGOs</abbr>. Deployments have included Bangladesh, Uganda, and Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The UK has worked to&nbsp;ensure that survivors are at the heart&nbsp;of our work. In 2019, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-announces-survivor-champions-to-help-end-sexual-violence-in-conflict">UK government appointed 2 <abbr title="Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative">PSVI</abbr> Survivor Champions</a>, Nadine Tunasi and Kolbassia Haoussou MBE, we are ensuring survivor voices are heard at our 2022 international <abbr title="Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative">PSVI</abbr> Conference.</p>

<p>While progress has been made,&nbsp;there remains much more to be done. The conference is an opportunity for the international community to come together and commit to making tangible progress towards stamping out this horrific crime, which has shattered lives and scarred communities across the world.</p>
