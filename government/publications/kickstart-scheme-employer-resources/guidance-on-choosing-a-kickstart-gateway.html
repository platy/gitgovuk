<h2>What is the Kickstart Scheme?</h2>

<p>The Kickstart Scheme is a £2 billion scheme to create thousands
of high-quality 6-month job placements for 16 – 24 year olds</p>

<p>The scheme is part of the plan for jobs and supports young people to develop new skills that will help them move into sustained employment after they have completed their Kickstart Scheme job placement.</p>

<p>The scheme provides employers of all sizes, across the private, public and voluntary sectors with the opportunity to access a large pool of young people with potential.</p>

<p>On confirmation of the job start the employer will be paid £1,500 per job placement to support overhead costs and help to improve the participant’s employability i.e. on-boarding, mentoring and supervision etc. Funding available for each job will cover the relevant National Minimum Wage rate for 25 hours a week, plus the associated employer National Insurance contributions, and employer minimum automatic enrolment contributions.</p>

<h3>Employers with any number of jobs can apply to the scheme</h3>

<p>Employers can apply directly or partner with an approved gateway.</p>

<h2>What is a gateway?</h2>

<p>Kickstart gateways act on behalf of employers by batching together applications and submitting them to the Department for Work and Pensions. They can help you with your initial application and some will support you in the training and development of your Kickstart worker.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-a-kickstart-gateway" class="govuk-link" rel="external">find a Kickstart gateway</a> that may be able to support you in applying for a Kickstart Scheme grant.</p>

<p>These organisations have been checked by the Department for Work and Pensions. Partnering with one of these organisations does not guarantee that you will get Kickstart Scheme funding – you will also be subject to checks.</p>

<p>When choosing a Kickstart gateway, you should consider the needs of your business. You can contact more than one organisation to find out which one works best for you.</p>

<h2>What should you consider when choosing a Kickstart gateway?</h2>

<p>The following are some of the things you may want to consider when choosing a Kickstart gateway.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Location</h3>

<p>Both national and local organisations have stepped forward to be Kickstart gateways.</p>

<p>You may already have links with an organisation that is interested in being a Kickstart gateway and feel that these ties will help you in the application process, or you may want to work with someone in your local community.</p>

<p>Example: A local authority</p>

<p>Or, you may feel more comfortable working with a national organisation that has operations around the country.</p>

<p>Example: A national trade organisation</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Sector</h3>

<p>You may want to work with an organisation that closely resembles your own or has close ties with your sector.</p>

<p>Example: A trade organisation</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Support</h3>

<p>Consider how much help you may need in your Kickstart Scheme application – e.g. pulling together a clear explanation of how the job you propose to offer is additional. And whether you would benefit from help in supporting your Kickstart worker through their job placement.</p>

<p>If you already have established training and development schemes you may not need as much help throughout the lifetime of the job placement. And bear in mind that if the Kickstart gateway provides employability support to your Kickstart worker they may expect a share of the £1,500 grant made available to cover this and the job placement’s start-up costs. You will want to discuss with any Kickstart gateway you are considering if they expect to share these costs.</p>

<p>Sole traders should apply through a Kickstart gateway that can employ a young person on their behalf, by placing them on their PAYE system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Aims</h3>

<p>When applying you should think about what you can offer by participating in the Kickstart scheme. This could be to increase the diversity of your workforce, to help disadvantaged young people in your local community or to create a pipeline or talent to help fill future vacancies.</p>

<p>The Kickstart scheme offers opportunities to both businesses and young people. You should discuss your aims with any potential Kickstart gateways and choose an organisation that aligns with your goals and values.</p>
