<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>To reduce the risk of registration fraud, HM Land Registry relies on the steps that conveyancers take, where appropriate, to verify the identity of their clients.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances HM Land Registry requires an application to include confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence. This helps us to decide what checks, if any, we may need to take before completing a registration.</p>

<p>This guide explains when confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required and how it should be given.</p>

<p>The information in this guide relates only to the evidence of identity that must be given to HM Land Registry. It does not deal with identity checks required by regulatory or representative bodies, or required by law, such as under the money laundering legislation.</p>

<p>If, when lodging an application, you dishonestly provide information or make a statement that you know is, or might be, untrue or misleading, and intend by doing so to make a gain for yourself or another person, or to cause loss or the risk of loss to another person, you may commit the offence of fraud under section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006, the maximum penalty for which is 10 yearsâ imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.</p>

<p>Our requirements are not intended to impose any new liabilities on conveyancers. HM Land Registry has a statutory right of recourse to recover amounts paid for indemnity under paragraph 10 of Schedule 8 to the Land Registration Act 2002 but this right is not used automatically or routinely. The right of recourse will not be used where a conveyancer has been neither fraudulent nor negligent.</p>

<p>Please note that your application will, depending on the circumstances, be cancelled if identity evidence is not provided when this is required.</p>

<p>The information in this guide must be read in conjunction with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-changes-to-hm-land-registrys-evidence-of-identity-requirements-pg67a">practice guide 67A: temporary changes to HM Land Registryâs evidence of identity requirements</a>, which includes temporary arrangements for the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity</h2>

<p>HM Land Registry require this to prevent registration fraud.</p>

<p>Land and buildings are usually the most valuable assets people own. They can be sold and mortgaged to raise money and can therefore be attractive targets for fraudsters. HM Land Registry and others involved in property-related transactions have procedures in place to safeguard against fraud and the requirement for confirmation of identity for certain types of transactions and applications help us to do this.</p>

<p>In most instances of fraud it is the purported disponor, rather than the applicant, who acts fraudulently. To tackle fraud effectively, we consider that it is essential that the identity of the disponor (and certain others) be verified before transactions take place and, therefore, that conveyancers lodging applications for registration should provide evidence of this.</p>

<p>So, as a conveyancer, in respect to most transactions you may be affected by our identity requirements in 2 ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>as the conveyancer sending an application to HM Land Registry on behalf of a client</li>
  <li>as a conveyancer providing evidence of identity for an unrepresented person involved in a transaction, using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Definitions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Conveyancer</h3>

<p>When we refer to a âconveyancerâ we mean an authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003). Please note that to come within the definition of conveyancer in rule 217A of the Land Registration Rules 2003 an individual must be authorised under the Legal Services Act 2007 to provide conveyancing services; in effect they must have a practising certificate.</p>

<p>A paralegal is not a conveyancer. A paralegal is someone who assists legal firms â they may sign application forms on behalf of a conveyancing firm that is an authorised person if they are authorised to do so by that firm. They cannot, however, verify identity.</p>

<p>Not all Chartered Legal Executives are conveyancers, only those who have been authorised by CILEx Regulation to undertake reserved instrument activities. We have agreed with the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx) and CILEx Regulation, however, that all Chartered Legal Executives can verify identity even though some may not be conveyancers.</p>

<p>While all Chartered Legal Executives may verify identity, only CILEX Conveyancing Practitioners can provide certificates to comply with Form LL restrictions. Please note that it is not sufficient for the person giving the certificate to describe themselves simply as CILEX Practitioner; this must always be CILEX Conveyancing Practitioner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Confirmation of identity</h3>

<p>âConfirmation of identityâ is the evidence required by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>panels 12 to 14 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>
</li>
  <li>panels 8 to 10 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-entries-relating-to-a-charge-registration-ds2">form DS2</a>
</li>
  <li>panels 14 to 16 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide is concerned with where the application is sent to HM Land Registry by a conveyancer and so panels 14 of form AP1, 10 of form DS2 and 16 of form FR1 are not relevant, because they deal with where the application is sent to HM Land Registry by someone who is not a conveyancer.</p>

<p>Where the application is sent to HM Land Registry by a conveyancer, confirmation of identity involves the conveyancer providing details of a conveyancer (sometimes themselves) who represented the person in respect of which confirmation of identity is required (by completing panels 13(1) of form AP1, 9(1) of form DS2 or 15(1) of form FR1).</p>

<p>In any case where that person was not represented by a conveyancer, the conveyancer sending the application must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the identity of that person (by completing the first box in panels 13(2) of form AP1, 9(2) of form DS2 or 15(2) of form FR1)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enclose âevidence of identityâ in respect of that person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state the exemption from supplying identity evidence being claimed under <a class="govuk-link" href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a> and enclose any evidence required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Evidence of identity</h3>

<p>âEvidence of identityâ (in the title to this guide and as used up to and including section 1, evidence of identity refers to both confirmation of identity and rule 17 identity evidence) is defined in panels 12 of form AP1, 8 of form DS2 and 14 of form FR1 as evidence provided in accordance with any current direction made by the Chief Land Registrar under section 100(4) of the Land Registration Act 2002 for the purpose of confirming a personâs identity. The current direction provides for either <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> to be enclosed with the relevant application, unless an exception applies. The exceptions are discussed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#when-confirmation-of-identity-or-rule-17-identity-evidence-is-required">When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</a>. Additionally, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/certificate-to-be-given-by-a-conveyancer-where-a-persons-identity-has-been-verified-by-way-of-an-online-video-call-id5">form ID5</a> must be completed where a conveyancer has verified a personâs identity by way of an online video call.(Forms ID1, ID2 and ID5 are prepared and published under section 100(4), and so are not prescribed under the Land Registration Rules 2003.) 
See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-changes-to-hm-land-registrys-evidence-of-identity-requirements-pg67a">practice guide 67A: temporary changes to HM Land Registryâs evidence of identity requirements where the verification of identity is by a non-conveyancer</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Rule 17 identity evidence</h3>

<p>Rule 17 of the Land Registration Rules 2003 allows us to ask for more documents or evidence to help us complete an application. We may cancel an application if you do not provide what we need. In this guide we use the term ârule 17 identity evidenceâ to refer to the extra documents or evidence we may ask for.</p>

<p>We set out in this guide and elsewhere some instances where we are likely to ask for confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence. However, we may require you to provide rule 17 identity evidence in other cases, sometimes even where a conveyancer has already confirmed they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify someoneâs identity.</p>

<p>You may find it difficult in practice to obtain identity evidence from a seller or other disponor after a disposition has completed. This may be the case even where the disponor has warranted they will do all they reasonably can to pass title to the disponee (as will usually be the case where a full or limited title guarantee has been given). We will not therefore ask you for additional evidence unless we are satisfied this is necessary or desirable.</p>

<p>In many cases we ask for rule 17 identity evidence because of the circumstances of an application rather than because of specific intelligence we have received. We often will not explain the exact basis for our concern. This helps protect our procedures from fraudsters. We do understand this may be frustrating and will prevent you from providing a full explanation to your client.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</h2>

<p>Confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required where indicated in the following table. Exceptions A to E referred to in the table are described immediately after the note to the table.</p>

<p>Where you or another conveyancer has represented a person then the exceptions do not apply and you must, where confirmation of identity applies, provide details of the conveyancer, as set out in the first box in panels 13(2) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>, 9(2) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-entries-relating-to-a-charge-registration-ds2">form DS2</a> or 15(2) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>, or, where rule 17 identity evidence is required, provide the equivalent information.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> This table deals with where a conveyancer sends the application to HM Land Registry. There is another exception to 5 but it applies where the Legal Aid Agency makes the application in its own name in form AP1 to complete by registration a legal charge, and has completed panel 7 of form AP1).</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> This table deals with where a conveyancer sends the application to HM Land Registry. There are 2 other exceptions to 6 but they apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the lender is:
    <ul>
      <li>the applicant, makes the application in its own name and has completed panel 6 of form DS2 or panel 7 of form AP1, as appropriate, and</li>
      <li>a bank incorporated, or building society formed, in the United Kingdom</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the Legal Aid Agency is the applicant and makes the application in its own name:
    <ul>
      <li>in form DS2 or in form AP1 to discharge a registered charge in form DS1, and has completed panel 6 of form DS2 or panel 7 of form AP1, as appropriate</li>
      <li>in form AP1 to release a registered charge in form DS3, and has completed panel 7 of form AP1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><sup>3</sup>An applicant is entitled to assume that a lender is a âmajor mortgage lenderâ if the lender is a member of UK Finance or the Building Societies Association.<br><br>Note: In respect of any other application the registrar may in a particular case require evidence as to identity, under rule 17 of the Land Registration Rules 2003. We may also extend the requirement to other types of applications at short notice.<br></p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Evidence of identity is not required for borrowers or guarantors who are not, or are not becoming, a registered proprietor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Exceptions</h3>

<p>In all cases below applicants must still complete panel 13(1) of the form AP1 for the excepted party. The exemptions relate to the additional evidence normally required when a party is not represented by a conveyancer.</p>

<h4>A. The low-value exception</h4>

<p>Form ID1 or form ID2 in respect of an unrepresented party is not required where the true value of the land which is the subject of the disposal, discharge or release is Â£6,000 or less. In these cases, the conveyancer must lodge instead a certificate confirming the value of the land by someone qualified to give property valuations; such as an estate agent, a surveyor, a land and property valuer or auctioneer who holds a qualification from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or some other person who is similarly qualified.</p>

<p>You may still supply evidence of identity if you prefer and HM Land Registry reserves the right to require evidence of identity in form ID1 or form ID2, in any particular case.</p>

<h4>B. The insolvency official, etc, exception</h4>

<p>Form ID1 is not required in respect of someone who is acting in one of the following capacities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator, supervisor, administrator or administrative receiver appointed under the Insolvency Act 1986</li>
  <li>as a receiver under the Law of Property Act 1925</li>
  <li>as a deputy appointed under the Mental Capacity Act 2005</li>
  <li>as a personal representative who assents or transfers the land - but see below</li>
  <li>as a guardian appointed under the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that evidence of their appointment must still be lodged with any application.</p>

<p>Please also note that although we do not routinely require evidence of identity for a personal representative, we may ask for this, in addition to evidence of their appointment, in some instances. We will let you know if this required.</p>

<h4>C. The not practicable exception</h4>

<p>Situations may arise where it is not practicable to provide form ID1 or form ID2, such as where the parties exchanged contracts before 10 November 2008 (the day on which the requirement for confirmation of identity was introduced) without providing for these forms, or where a tenant has âwalked awayâ from their lease and application is now being made to close the leasehold title following its surrender by operation of law. In these or other situations the conveyancer who is sending the application should enclose a covering letter with the application explaining why they are not able to provide form ID1 or form ID2.</p>

<p>It may also not be possible to provide form ID1 for a person who lacks capacity. However, where that person has made either a lasting power of attorney (or an enduring power of attorney that has not been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian) but it appears the person lacks capacity, HM Land Registry would require proof that the donor lacks capacity, such as a letter or report from a medical doctor. (Where the person has made an enduring power of attorney that has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, such medical evidence will not be necessary.) In all cases, identity evidence for the attorney would still be required.</p>

<p>Similarly, where a person is missing, we will not require evidence of their identity where an application is made relating to their property by a guardian appointed pursuant to the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act 2017.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry does not consider âinconvenienceâ sufficient reason for not providing form ID1 or form ID2. For example, the fact that a person is resident overseas is in itself not an acceptable reason. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#overseas">Verification of identity of persons resident overseas</a> for more information where a person is resident overseas.</p>

<p>Please also note that where contracts were exchanged on or after 10 November 2008 HM Land Registry would expect, where appropriate, provision to have been made for confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence.</p>

<h4>D. The HM Land Registry facility letter exception</h4>

<p>HM Land Registry has issued facility letters in respect of the identity of a limited number of people who deal regularly with HM Land Registry. A copy of the facility letter may be enclosed with any application in place of a form ID1 or form ID2 in respect of such a person.</p>

<p>âFacility lettersâ are issued to private individuals and corporate bodies who regularly deal with low value (under Â£100,000) land transactions such as the sale of ground rents and souvenir land. The Â£100,000 limit relates to the value of the land involved in the transaction.</p>

<p>Please note that we will not be accepting applications for new facility letters until further notice.</p>

<h4>E. The retained evidence of identity (following HM Land Registry approval of a draft transfer or lease of part) exception</h4>

<p>HM Land Registry provides a service for the approval of draft forms of transfers and leases of part for specific developments. For information about this please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developing-estates-registration-services-approval-of-draft-transfers-and-leases">practice guide 41, supplement 3: developing estates: registration services â approval of draft transfers and leases</a>. Rule 17 identity evidence for any attorney acting for the transferor or landlord does not have to be lodged with each individual transfer or lease for registration where, as part of this service, that evidence has been lodged with the draft for approval and has been retained by HM Land Registry.</p>

<h4>F. Legal charge up to Â£10,000 to a local authority in respect of a service charge loan</h4>

<p>No identity evidence is required for any party, including the applicant, where an application is made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register a legal charge to a local authority</li>
  <li>the value of the charge as stated on the charge deed or application form is up to Â£10,000</li>
  <li>the charge is in respect of a service charge loan and this is clearly stated in the charge deed or on the application form</li>
</ul>

<p>A local authority may be required under the housing acts or other legislation to maintain and keep in repair the fabric of buildings, including those where a tenant has acquired a lease under the right to buy legislation. The authority is statutorily obliged to secure the cost of this work by way of a charge.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Confirmation of identity</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>How to provide confirmation of identity</h3>

<p>Where your application is one within 1 to 6 in the table in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#when-confirmation-of-identity-or-rule-17-identity-evidence-is-required">When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</a> you must use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-entries-relating-to-a-charge-registration-ds2">form DS2</a> as appropriate for your type of application and complete the relevant panels as indicated in the forms for each relevant person (for attorneys, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#attorneys">Attorneys</a>).</p>

<p>The following guidance relates to form AP1 where the application is sent to HM Land Registry by a conveyancer, but the same principles apply to form FR1 and form DS2.</p>

<h4>Panel 12</h4>

<p>Confirm that you are a conveyancer.</p>

<h4>Panel 13</h4>

<p>In the first part of this panel, enter the full names of all persons for whom confirmation of identity is required in the first column, do not use initials. Enter each party in a separate box (for example transferor, transferee, lender) â see <a class="govuk-link" href="#example-1">Example 1 in the Appendix</a>. Where an attorney is acting, for the sake of clarity the attorney and donor must also be listed in separate boxes on the AP1 and FR1 â see <a class="govuk-link" href="#example-2">Example 2 in the Appendix</a>. Place a cross in the second column against the name of any of these persons you represent. In the third column, either enter details of the conveyancer(s) who act for any of the other persons or if any are unrepresented insert ânoneâ.</p>

<p>You will also need to complete the second part of this panel if you wrote ânoneâ to confirm that a person is not represented, unless one of the exceptions set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#when-confirmation-of-identity-or-rule-17-identity-evidence-is-required">When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</a> applies, in which case you should refer to the exception and provide the relevant evidence. For example, if exception C (not practicable to provide identity evidence) applies you should refer to it and provide the necessary covering letter.</p>

<p>Where an exception does not apply, then for each unrepresented person you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm that you are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify their identity</li>
  <li>enclose evidence of their identity in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-citizen-id1">form ID1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/verify-identity-corporate-body-id2">form ID2</a> (as to which see <a class="govuk-link" href="#completion-of-form-id1-and-form-id2">Completion of forms ID1 and ID2</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are able to give the confirmation for some but not all of the unrepresented persons you should insert the names of those persons for whom you are giving confirmation.</p>

<p>If there is insufficient room in the panel, use form CS or include the information in a covering letter.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Discharges in paper form DS1 or releases in form DS3</h3>

<p>Confirmation of identity in relation to the lender is required for discharges in paper form. We do not require confirmation where a discharge is sent to HM Land Registry electronically, that is by EDs or e-DS1s.</p>

<p>Conveyancers have stated that they do not usually act for a discharging lender when, for example, they act for a transferor on a sale. HM Land Registryâs view though is that as they are redeeming the transferorâs mortgage, are in touch with the lender, and are willing to transfer the redemption moneys to them, they must be satisfied that they are dealing with the right person and ought to be able to confirm to HM Land Registry or to a buyerâs conveyancer that they are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the lenderâs identity. If they are not willing to do this, we will require form ID1 or form ID2 in respect of that lender.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>How to provide rule 17 identity evidence</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Attorneys</h3>

<p>Rule 17 identity evidence is usually required for any attorney mentioned in the table in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#when-confirmation-of-identity-or-rule-17-identity-evidence-is-required">When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</a>, except where one of the exceptions referred to in the table applies.</p>

<p>Normally, you should enter the name of the attorney in panel 13 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a> or panel 15 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a>. If there is insufficient room, use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/continuation-sheet-applications-and-dispostions-cs">form CS</a> or include the information in a covering letter.</p>

<p>Where an attorney is acting, for the sake of clarity the attorney and the donor must be listed in separate boxes on the AP1 and FR1.</p>

<p>If the attorney is represented by you, then tick the relevant box in the panel. If the attorney is represented by another conveyancer, enter their details in the panel, or form CS or in the covering letter.</p>

<p>Where the attorney is unrepresented then you should provide evidence as to their identity. This can either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by way of a certificate confirming that you are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the attorneyâs identity</li>
  <li>by lodging form ID1 or form ID2 for the attorney (as to which see <a class="govuk-link" href="#completion-of-form-id1-and-form-id2">Completion of forms ID1 and ID</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following wording is suggested for the certificate:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>âI confirm that I am satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the identity of â¦â¦â¦â¦.., the attorney of â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..â.</p>
</div>

<p>The certificate can be included in a covering letter or form CS or, for example, you could amend the certificate in the second part of panel 13 of form AP1 or the second part of panel 15 of form FR1.</p>

<p>Although the Land Registration Rules 2003 do not provide for the amendment of the wording in prescribed forms, HM Land Registry will not reject or question any form AP1 or form FR1 amended in this way.</p>

<p>Please note that the donor of a power and their attorney are separate persons for the purpose of our identity requirements and confirmation of identity in respect of the donor and, usually, rule 17 identity evidence in respect of the attorney must be provided, except where this guide says it not required.</p>

<p>Evidence of identity (or the equivalent where rule 17 applies) will be required for either or both where they are not represented. Where a power of attorney has itself been made and executed by an attorney, you will need to provide rule 17 identity evidence for each attorney in the chain.</p>

<h4>6.1.1 Why HM Land Registry requires rule 17 identity evidence for attorneys</h4>

<p>Where an attorney is acting, HM Land Registry needs to be satisfied that they have sufficient powers to effect what they are purporting to do. We also need to be satisfied that the power under which they are acting is genuine and the attorney is who they claim to be. We consider this is both reasonable and necessary to prevent registration fraud.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry has always required evidence of the existence and scope of the power, and will accept either the power or a certificate in Form 1 to Schedule 3 to the Land Registration Rules 2003.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we also require rule 17 identity evidence in respect of the attorney. It is not HM Land Registry which deals with a disponor or their attorney, it is the conveyancer acting for the applicant who does and is, therefore, better placed to satisfy themselves that they are dealing with the right person.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Voluntary applications for first registration where the title documents have been lost or destroyed</h3>

<p>Rule 17 identity evidence in respect of the applicant for registration is required for all applications for voluntary first registration where the title documents have been lost or destroyed, except where one of the exceptions referred or set out at 7 in the table in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#when-confirmation-of-identity-or-rule-17-identity-evidence-is-required">When confirmation of identity or rule 17 identity evidence is required</a> applies. This is so even where the applicant is represented and a conveyancer is lodging the application for registration.</p>

<p>As there will not have been a disposal triggering first registration, the wording in panel 15 of form FR1 may be changed to refer to the applicant, rather than, for example, the transferee.</p>

<p>For more information about applications for first registration where the documents have been lost or destroyed, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registration-of-title-where-deeds-have-been-lost-or-destroyed">practice guide 2: first registration of title where deeds have been lost or destroyed</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Change of name</h3>

<p>Rule 17 identity evidence is required where an application is being made to alter the register following a change of name by deed poll, statutory declaration or statement of truth and the application is not combined with other applications.</p>

<p>A standalone change of name application where the supporting evidence is a deed poll, statutory declaration or statement of truth must be lodged using form AP1 and must include either a certificate confirming that you are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the personâs identity or evidence as to identity in form ID1.</p>

<p>The following wording is suggested for the certificate which must give the personâs current name:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>âI confirm that I am satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify the identity of â¦â¦â¦â¦.. and that they are the registered proprietor or the person named in entry number [X] in the register of title â¦â¦â¦.â.</p>
</div>

<p>The certificate may be given in a covering letter, or, for example, by amending the certificate in the second part of panel 13 of form AP1.</p>

<p>Although the Land Registration Rules 2003 do not provide for the amendment of the wording in prescribed forms, HM Land Registry will not reject or question any form AP1 amended in this way.</p>

<p>As mentioned, if such a certificate cannot be given, then you should lodge form ID1 in the new name as well as copies of official documentation to establish a link to the person named in the register. This might be a passport, driverâs licence or utility bill that shows the former name (as to which see <a class="govuk-link" href="#completion-of-form-id1-and-form-id2">Completion of form ID1 and form ID2</a>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Application is re-lodged by a different conveyancer to the one who lodged it originally</h2>

<p>There will be occasions when an application which is withdrawn or cancelled is re-lodged for registration by a different conveyancer to the one who lodged it originally. This might happen, for example, following an intervention in the original conveyancerâs practice, where the original conveyancer has otherwise ceased to trade or where a party to a transaction has changed their conveyancer.</p>

<p>Where a firm has been intervened in, it is acceptable for their intervening agent, to show on the application form (AP1, FR1 or DS2) who originally acted for the parties - they do not have to show who acts for them currently - and include the evidence and statements as to identity as provided by the original conveyancer. The intervening agent should state on the application form if the original conveyancer has ceased to trade.</p>

<p>Where there has not been an intervention, the conveyancer lodging the application should always complete their application form to show who currently acts for parties, not who acted for them previously. It is not appropriate for the lodging conveyancer to say that a party is represented by the former conveyancer; they must state who acts for that party currently. HM Land Registry will accept, however, an identity form (form ID1 or ID2) verified by the former conveyancer or by another conveyancer provided it is no more than 6 months old at the time that the renewed application is made. We will also accept confirmation of identity where the lodging conveyancer completes panel 13(2) of form AP1 (or equivalent on a form FR1 or DS2) to the effect that sufficient steps have been taken to verify a partyâs identity. If it is within the lodging conveyancerâs knowledge, they should also state if the original conveyancer has ceased to trade.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Completion of form ID1 and form ID2</h2>

<p>You may submit either the original or a certified copy of the ID form(s). Copy forms, however submitted, must always include both sides of the photo signed and dated on the reverse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Evidence as to identity in form ID1 and form ID2</h3>

<p>If you are neither able to confirm that a conveyancer acted for them nor that you are satisfied that sufficient steps have been taken to verify their identity, you must provide evidence as to identity for each unrepresented person as explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="#confirmation-identity">Confirmation of identity</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/evidence-of-identity-conveyancers/practice-guide-67-evidence-of-identity-conveyancers#how-to-provide-rule-17-identity-evidence">How to provide rule 17 identity evidence</a>. The evidence should be in form ID1 (for a private individual) or form ID2 (for a body corporate).</p>

<p>Both parts of form ID1 or form ID2 (and form ID5 where appropriate) lodged in support of an application must be dated and signed no more than 6 months before the time of lodgement. Where a conveyancer verifies identity by way of a video call, they must complete form ID5 instead of section B of an ID1 or D2. The form ID5 must be kept with and lodged with the ID1 or ID2.</p>

<p>The photograph to be attached to the form must be passport size, on photographic paper and in colour. We do not require the image to be of the same standard required by, for example, HM Passport Office. It must be not more than 6 months old and the personâs face must be clearly visible. ID forms may be rejected if this is not the case. If the verification was done by way of a video call and form ID5 is being completed, you must instead send us a screenshot, taken during the video call, of the person whose identity you have verified. This must be in colour.</p>

<p>Completed forms ID1, ID2 and ID5 are not open to public inspection and normally a person may not apply for an official copy of them (rules 133 and 135 of the Land Registration Rules 2003, subject to rule 140 â application in connection with court proceedings, insolvency and tax liability).</p>

<p>Note: Our normal requirement is for both parts of an ID form and the photograph to be no more than 3 months old at the time of lodgment but this has been extended temporarily to 6 months until further notice because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Verification of identity by a conveyancer</h3>

<p>The identity of a person for whom form ID1 or ID2 is being lodged must be verified by an individual who is a conveyancer who must complete section B of the form. This can be any conveyancer. It does not have to be the conveyancer acting for any person relevant to the transaction. For example, if the transferor is unrepresented and needs to provide form ID1, it does not have to be the transfereeâs conveyancer who verifies the transferorâs identity. The transferor can go to any convenient conveyancer for that purpose. Section B of an ID form should not be signed by an individual acting as an employee of a conveyancer unless that individual is a conveyancer in their own right.</p>

<p>Where a personâs identity is verified by way of an online video call, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-changes-to-hm-land-registrys-evidence-of-identity-requirements-pg67a">practice guide 67A: temporary changes to HM Land Registryâs evidence of identity requirements</a>.</p>

<p>We will not normally accept verification by someone who is not a conveyancer. If a person for whom identity evidence is required is unable to go to a conveyancer, you should contact Customer Support on 0300 006 0411 to discuss whether an alternative arrangement is acceptable.</p>

<p>HM Land Registry will contact conveyancers and other verifiers to check that a form completed in their name is genuine. It is therefore important for them to keep a record of anyone for whom they have verified identity and a duplicate of the photograph they have certified. If a verifier cannot confirm this, then a new ID form may be required. If the verification was done by way of a video call, the verifier must also take a screenshot of the person whose identity they verified during the call. The screenshot must accompany the form ID5 which should itself accompany the form ID1 or ID2. The conveyancer should also retain a copy with their records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Verification of identity by a Chartered Legal Executive</h3>

<p>We have agreed with CILEx and CILEx Regulation that all Chartered Legal Executives can verify identity even though some may not be conveyancers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Verification of identity by a serving officer of the UK armed forces operating overseas</h3>

<p>Where a member of the UK armed forces is serving overseas they can have their identity verified by an officer who is also serving with them overseas. In this situation the verifier must provide their passport number.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span>Verification by HM Land Registry</h3>

<p>It is currently not possible for HM Land Registry to verify a personâs identity due to the closure of our customer information centres because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span>Verification of identity of persons resident overseas</h3>

<p>Where a person is resident overseas and it is not possible for their identity to be verified by a UK conveyancer, section B of the form ID1 or form ID2 should be completed and signed by a lawyer or notary public qualified to practise in the personâs country of residence. The form must be accompanied by written evidence of the lawyerâs or notaryâs authority to practise in their jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Form ID1 or ID2 will always be required. The option in form AP1, form FR1 and form DS2 that sufficient steps have been taken to verify someoneâs identity cannot be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span>Corporate bodies</h3>

<p>Corporate bodies can have their identity âstolenâ in the same way as private individuals, so our identity requirements apply to them in the same way. If you are verifying a corporationâs identity for the purpose of form ID2, you should always require the production of satisfactory evidence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the corporate body the individual represents and the registered proprietor or person entitled to be registered as proprietor are one and the same</li>
  <li>that the corporate body still exists</li>
  <li>that the individual representing them is authorised to act</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.7.1 Corporate bodies</h4>

<p>In confirming a corporate bodyâs identity, you should take care to ensure that the party to a transaction is in fact the same body named in the register. For example, does the party to the transaction have the same company registration number, or other registration number appropriate for that type of body, shown in the register for the registered owner? If the names differ can you account for the change of name?</p>

<p>In the case of a company, has there been any recent change in the address of the registered office, or of the companyâs officers? If changes have occurred can these be accounted for?</p>

<p>Is there any information in the company search, such as the date of the companyâs registration, which might suggest that the party to the transaction cannot be the registered proprietor? The date of registration as proprietor is the date appearing in brackets immediately before the bodyâs name in the proprietorship or charges register. A discrepancy without any legitimate reason may be a risk factor.</p>

<h4>8.7.2 Check if the corporate body still exists</h4>

<p>Is there any indication that the corporate body has been dissolved? In the case of companies, a company search should always be made to ensure that the company still exists.</p>

<h4>8.7.3 The individualâs connection with the corporate body</h4>

<p>In confirming or verifying identity you will also need to establish the individualâs role within the organisation or their connection to it. Are they a director or the company secretary or do they have some agency relationship with the body, for example as their attorney? And what evidence have they produced to confirm this?</p>

<p>If they are not a director or the company secretary, have they produced any documentary evidence confirming their authority to act?</p>

<p>Please note that we do not require identity evidence for receivers, liquidators or administrators, as other evidence of their authority to act for a company will have to be lodged with applications where they are involved.</p>

<h4>8.7.4 Foreign corporations</h4>

<p>If there is any indication in the register that the proprietor is a foreign corporation, are you satisfied that the party to the transaction is the same organisation? A company search will show if a UK company has been set up with the same name.</p>

<p>When dealing with a foreign corporate body that is not represented by a conveyancer, you should expect to see, for example, a letter from a lawyer authorised to practise in the country of the bodyâs incorporation confirming that it still exists and that the representative is authorised to act for them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Multiple applications</h2>

<p>If you intend to send 2 or more applications at the same time via the same electronic channel or to our postal address, and any of the persons for whom you need to provide confirmation of identity are the same, you need enclose only one set of identity evidence for those persons for all of the applications.</p>

<p>But if the persons in the applications are different you will need identity evidence for each separate person.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Registry rejection and cancellation policy</h2>

<p>Please note that because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, HM Land Registry will not reject applications where evidence or confirmation of identity is completely missing until further notice. We still expect customers, however, to complete applications as correctly and as fully as possible. We will send a request for information (requisition) where the evidence or confirmation required is not provided in the situations described on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-application-registration-fr1">form FR1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-entries-relating-to-a-charge-registration-ds2">form DS2</a>.</p>

<p>Applications may be cancelled where evidence or confirmation of identity requested is not provided.</p>

<p>Conveyancers only need to complete the âName of lenderâ section if they are submitting a paper discharge.</p>
