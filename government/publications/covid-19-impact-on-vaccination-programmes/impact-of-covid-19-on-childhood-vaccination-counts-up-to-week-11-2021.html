<h2>Introduction to the report to week 11, 2021</h2>

<p>This report presents vaccination counts data up to week 11 of 2021 (compared with the same period in 2020 and 2019) in the charts below, and should be read in conjunction with the last published full report: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-impact-on-vaccination-programmes">Impact of COVID-19 on childhood vaccination counts to week 9, and vaccine coverage to January 2021 in England</a>, <abbr title="Health Protection Report">HPR</abbr> 15(5).</p>

<p>The charts below show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of dose 1 Hexavalent vaccine doses delivered in England in week 11 (Figure 1) were lower than during the same week in 2019 and 2020, and the overall difference in vaccination counts delivered in 2021 was lower than in 2019 and 2020 (Figures 1 and 3)</li>
  <li>the number of dose 1 <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine doses delivered in England in week 11 (Figure 2) were lower than during the same week in 2019 but were higher compared to doses given during the same week in 2020. The overall difference in vaccination counts delivered in 2021 was lower than in 2019 and 2020 (Figures 2 and 4)</li>
  <li>in 2021, vaccination counts for Hexavalent and <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine were 10.7% and 2.7% lower in week 11, compared to week 11 in 2019, respectively</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that the vaccine count data presented here is a proxy measure for the vaccine coverage data that is being reported on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>In figures 1 and 2 it should be noted that direct comparisons for the weekly data between 2019, 2020 and 2021 should be made with caution since the days do not map the same weeks (week 1 data for 2021 only accounts for 3 days). Also, that school holidays (often coinciding with family holidays) are for the 2020 calendar year. These holidays may vary slightly by year and by local area. School holidays for the 2019 to 2020 academic year were in weeks 43, 52, 53, 1, 8, 15, 16, 19, 22, 30 to 36. School holidays for the 2020 to 2021 academic year are in weeks 44, 52, 53, 7, 13, 14, 18, 22, 29 to 35.</p>

<h2>Hexavalent vaccination counts to week 11</h2>

<p>Figure 1 below shows weekly dose 1 Hexavalent vaccination counts in infants younger than 6 months in The Phoenix Partnership (<abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr>) practices open in both 2019 and 2020, or both 2019 and 2021, in England: 2019, 2020 and 2021. School holidays for the 2020 calendar year are shown in grey (see <abbr title="Health Protection Report">HPR</abbr> 15(5) report for full notes on this graph).</p>

<h2>Percentage change in vaccination counts in 2021 and 2020 compared with 2019, to week 11</h2>

<p>Figure 3 below shows percentage change in dose 1 Hexavalent vaccination counts (in infants under 6 months) in 2021 and 2020 compared to 2019, by week, in <abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr> practices in England. (Direct comparisons for the weekly data between 2019, 2020 and 2021 should be made with caution since the days do not map the same weeks: week 1 data for 2021 only accounts for 3 days.)</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Aggregated weekly vaccination counts from 2019, 2020 and 2021 for dose 1 Hexavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Hepatitis B) delivered to infants 6 months and younger, and MMR1 (first dose of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) to children between the ages of 12 and 18 months, were provided by the general practice (GP) information technology supplier, <a rel="external" href="https://www.tpp-uk.com/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr></a>. Weekly trends in vaccination counts were compared between 2019, 2020 and 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="The Phoenix Partnership">TPP</abbr> represents approximately 38% of data for all GP practices in England and some regions are less represented than others.</p>
