<p>Our worked examples show how to calculate whether the furlough payment equates to less than the appropriate minimum wage entitlement for time spent training.</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>18-year-old first year apprentice is on a 37 hours per week contract and has been furloughed. They are continuing to train for 1 day per week (7.5 hours per week).</p>

<p>In terms of the National Minimum Wage (<abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>) regulations they are entitled to £4.15 for every hour they train. (Note that the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> legislation does not apply to time not in work or training).</p>

<p>Over the 3-week furlough period (the pay reference period) this amounts to a <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> entitlement of £93.38 (£4.15 x 7.5 hours x 3 weeks).</p>

<p>The 80% furlough payment that they have received from their employer is £368. This furlough payment provides sufficient money to cover these training hours.</p>

<p>From September 2020, where the level of grant from the government has been reduced to below 80%, the employer must substitute the contribution the government is currently making, ensuring that staff continue to receive at least 80% of their salary, up to £2,500 a month.</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p>22-year-old second year apprentice is on a 37 hours per week contract and has been furloughed. They have agreed, with their employer and provider, to train for 4 days per week (7.5 hours per day) (to cover as much off-the-job training as possible during this period).</p>

<p>In terms of the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> regulations they are entitled to £8.20 for every hour they train. (Note that the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> legislation does not apply to time not in work or training).</p>

<p>Over the 3-week furlough period (the pay reference period) this amounts to a <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr> entitlement of £738 (£8.20 x 7.5 hours x 4 days x 3 weeks).</p>

<p>The 80% furlough payment that they have received from their employer is £728.16. This furlough payment does not provide sufficient money to cover these training hours and the employer would need to top up the difference (£9.84).</p>

<p>From September 2020, where the level of grant from the government has been reduced to below 80%, the employer must substitute the contribution the government is currently making, ensuring that staff continue to receive at least 80% of their salary, up to £2,500 a month. This is in addition to the £9.84 calculated above.</p>

<p>Please note that in both cases above the apprentice, prior to furlough, was paid at or close to the <abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>.</p>
