<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Before you start</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">The form is available online.</a></p>

<p>The form may be used to make an appeal to alter the valuation of your property in Wales. If your property is in England you need to go to the VOA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="#">check and challenge service</a>.</p>

<p>You can also propose changes to property details if you think they’re wrong.</p>

<p>You will need details about your property’s rateable value and other information that the VOA hold about your property.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">find these details online with the property valuation</a> or on your rates bill.</p>

<p>If a rent or license fee is paid you will need details of the rent, including when it was first paid, and the name and address of the property owner. It is important that you enter sufficient information about the property to enable us to identify it correctly and to help satisfy legal requirements. If you do not answer all sections fully your form may not be accepted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who can make an appeal (also known as a proposal)?</h2>

<p>The current owner or the occupier (or an agent representing them), or persons with certain legal interests in the property at the date the proposal is made.</p>

<p>Former ratepayers of the property who wish to challenge an alteration made to the rating list while they were the ratepayer.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances the billing authority where the property is located.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Time limits</h2>

<p>In most cases a proposal must be made between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>A proposal made citing a decision of a Valuation Tribunal, or higher court, must be made no later than 30 September 2022.</p>

<p>If your proposal relates to a change to the property or to changes in the local area, it is important to tell us a soon as possible. This is because the date we receive the proposal sets the date we consider those changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>General information</h2>

<p>You can find information about business rates, how your rates are calculated, and find your rateable value online at www.gov.uk/voa.</p>

<p>The rating list is produced by the Valuation Officer and the information it contains is used by local councils to calculate your rates bill. It includes the property address, the rateable value (the property value), and the date this value is effective from.</p>

<p>Please note rateable values are based on the rent at which the property could have been let on 1 April 2015. Any general changes in the rental market since then, either upward or downward, will not affect rateable value.</p>

<p>Following a revaluation, rateable values will generally remain unchanged until the next revaluation unless the property is altered or changes to the local area take place.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>If you need help completing this form</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email - <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:%20ndrinbox@voa.gov.uk">ndrinbox@voa.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the current outbreak of COVID-19, we are unable to offer a telephony service. Please use the email address above. We are sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Completing the form</h2>

<p>You can tell us about more than one property for example in the case of dividing or merging property using this form. Please record details of the first property on the form and detail the remaining properties on a separate sheet. This should then be attached to the form.</p>

<p>Please note if you are proposing changes at different dates in time you must use a separate form for each change.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Part A: details of the property / rating assessment</h2>

<p>This section refers to property details held by the VOA. These details are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">found online with the property
valuation</a>, on your rates bill, or on a notice of alteration served by the Valuation Officer.</p>

<p>1) Enter the full address of the property held by the VOA. If you are proposing a new entry (see box 12G) enter the address which you consider should be shown. If the existing address is incorrect please also show the correct full postal address. Use box 14 of Part C of the form if there is insufficient space.</p>

<p>2) Enter the description of the property eg “Shop and premises”. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">find this with your property valuation online</a>.</p>

<p>3) Enter the name of the present occupier of the property shown at 1 on the form. If the property is unoccupied please enter “Vacant”.</p>

<p>4) The full postal address of the occupier of the property should be provided here if it is different from that shown at 1 on the form. Otherwise enter “as 1”.</p>

<p>5) Enter the rateable value of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">property found online</a>.</p>

<p>6) The effective date is the date from which a new or altered liability for business rate payment starts. If you disagree with the effective date please indicate this in Part B of the form.</p>

<p>7) If the property is occupied by the owner please tick the box “Owner/Occupied”. If not, enter the name of the owner of the property in the space provided.</p>

<p>8) The full postal address of the owner should be entered only if it is different from that shown for 1 and 4. Otherwise enter “as 1” or “as 4” as appropriate.</p>

<p>9) If the property is not owner occupied, and rent or a licence fee is paid, you must tick the “Yes” box. Then state the current amount payable per year (exclusive of rates, service charges and VAT, if applicable). You may also state the date that this rent first became payable. This is normally when the lease or agreement commenced or at a subsequent rent review. If you know the date the rent is next reviewed please enter. If you are in a rent free period at present please state this in the “current annual rent” box. The Valuation Officer may send you a statutory
notice requesting more details of the rent.</p>

<p>10) Please enter the name of the billing authority which collects the rates on the property.</p>

<p>11) Enter the billing authority reference number <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/correct-your-business-rates">found online with the property valuation</a> and on your rates bill.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Part B: details of the proposed changes</h2>

<p>This part of the form should be used to record the nature of the change you are proposing.</p>

<p>12) The series of tick boxes A to E identify many of the most commonly made alterations. Box G should be used if you propose to include a new entry (that is one not currently shown in a rating list). In order to ensure that we can accept the appeal you must also complete all additional boxes in the same row. If the change you wish to make is not described in 12A-E or G, please use the “other changes” box in 12F, stating exactly what change you propose. Please also state the date from which you consider the proposed change should take effect.</p>

<p>We have given some examples to help you complete this part of the form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Example 1</h3>

<p>If you think the valuation on 1 April 2017 is wrong you should tick box A, include the value you think is correct in the next box, and insert “01-04-2017” in the last box in the row.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Example 2</h3>

<p>If you are appealing because there has been a change to the property or in the local area, you will need to tick box A and indicate its effect upon the value. In the “with effect from” box the date on which you believe the change occurred eg 10 May 2017 should be entered as “10-05-2017”.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Example 3</h3>

<p>If you think that the property should no longer be included in the rating list eg a shop has stopped trading and has been converted to wholly domestic use, tick box B and show in the box on this row the date you believe the change occurred.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Example 4</h3>

<p>If you think that two or more list entries should be shown as one or more different entries, tick box D. Then insert the number of existing entries and the number of new entries you believe should be included. You must also include the date the change in occupation took place. This option can apply when one property is now occupied with a different property ie the properties are merged.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Part C: reasons for your appeal</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Completing Question 13 - tick box options</h3>

<p>Please select only one statement that best describes why you are proposing the alteration you have
shown in Part B. You may select two or more reasons under certain circumstances, please contact the
Valuation Officer for advice if you wish to do this.</p>

<p>Box 13/01: if you think the rateable value was incorrect when the property was revalued on 1 April 2017. Do not
select this ground if the relevant entry was inserted in the rating list after 1 April 2017 even if it had effect from that day, select Box 13/02 instead.</p>

<p>Box 13/02: if you think the rateable value is incorrect following an alteration made by the Valuation Officer. Please also enter the date the alteration was made. This list alteration date is shown online or on your rates bill and in the
notice of alteration issued by the Valuation Officer. If you also disagree with the effective date of the alteration
please also tick box 13/03 and state the date you believe is appropriate.</p>

<p>Box 13/03: if you are not disputing the accuracy of the rateable value made by the Valuation Officer but disagree with its effective date ie the date on which the valuation was applied. Please also enter the date the alteration was made by the Valuation Officer. This list alteration date is shown online or on your rates bill and in the notice of alteration issued by the Valuation Officer.</p>

<p>Box 13/04: if you believe the rateable value is inaccurate because circumstances affecting the rateable value have
changed. This may be due to a physical change to an area or the property, or to the way the property is used. You should enter in the space provided the date the change of circumstances occurred. NB you should also have indicated your view of the effect of the change on the rateable value in Part B section 12.</p>

<p>Box 13/05: if you think the rating list entry should be deleted because the property has been demolished or no longer exists. Do not use if your property is in a poor state of repair but still in existence, in this circumstance select option 13/04.</p>

<p>Box 13/06: if you believe the rating list entry should be deleted from a rating list. If for example the property is now
used wholly for residential purposes or is exempt from rating by virtue of it being an agricultural building.</p>

<p>Box 13/07: if you think an entry in a rating list should be deleted for a reason other than 13/05 or 13/06 eg an entry
appears in the wrong list as a result of a local authority boundary change.</p>

<p>Box 13/08: if the property is currently shown in the rating list as a single entry and should be shown as more than one entry ie it is occupied as two or more separate parts.</p>

<p>Box 13/09: if you consider that two or more existing entries should be combined into a single entry ie all the property is in the same occupation, or if it forms two or more different entries from those shown in a rating list.</p>

<p>Box 13/10: if your proposal is to include a property that is currently not shown in that list.</p>

<p>Box 13/11: if you believe the entry shown in a rating list is wrong in the light of a Tribunal or Court decision relating
to another property. You must enter the date of the decision, name of the Tribunal/Court and the address of the
property to which the decision relates. You must also provide your reasons for believing that the decision is relevant to the property identified in Part A. You must also state why, in the light of the decision, you consider the list entry to be inaccurate. If you do not provide all this information the proposal may not be accepted.</p>

<p>Box 13/12: if you consider that the address, description or any other statement required by law to be shown in a rating list about the property is wrong or has been omitted.</p>

<p>These options have been summarised. The exact statements in law are contained in The Non-Domestic Rating (Alteration of Lists and Appeals) (Wales) Regulations 2005.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Part C: detailed reasons</h2>

<p>14) You must give detailed reasons why you believe the entry in the rating list is inaccurate.</p>

<p>For example considering option 13/04, the reason might be that part of the property has been demolished, or that a newly built property has been occupied by a competitor and as a consequence there has been a change in the rental value of the property identified in Part A. Please include enough information for the Valuation Officer to make a decision on your appeal. Please use a separate sheet to include more information if you need to.</p>

<h2>
