<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: consultation on implementing the direct national funding formula</h2>

<p>We are seeking views on our approach to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-the-direct-national-funding-formula">implementing the direct national funding formula (NFF) for mainstream schools</a>.</p>

<p>This consultation follows on from our summer 2021 consultation on completing our reforms to the NFF.</p>

<p>Our first consultation on the direct NFF, Fair school funding for all, focused on the principles of moving to a direct formula. Following feedback to that consultation, the Government published its response, which confirmed our commitment to introduce the direct NFF.</p>

<p>This consultation focuses on the detail of the implementation of the direct NFF. We are seeking views on our suggested approach, to ensure that the direct NFF is implemented as effectively and smoothly as possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: year-end forecast funding claim for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<span class="number">4. </span>Information: local authority post-16 grant return for the 2021 to 2022 financial year</h2>

<p>We sent an email to all local authority chief financial officers copied to chief executives on 31 May 2022, highlighting the requirement for local authorities  to submit their post-16 grant return for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>This must be signed by the chief finance officers in the template provided and returned to ESFA, by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:academiesfinancialmonitoring.efa@education.gov.uk">academiesfinancialmonitoring.efa@education.gov.uk</a> by 30 June 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: adult education budget (AEB) funding rates and formula guidance for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rates-and-formula-2022-to-2023">published version 1 of the 2022 to 2023 AEB funding rates and formula</a>. There are no major changes to the funding system from the 2021 to 2022 year. The only minor change to the guidance document is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we have removed references to high value courses for school and college leavers: a one-year offer for 18 and 19-year-olds, as you were required to complete delivery on these courses by 31 March 2022 in the 2021 to 2022 funding year.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: supporting pupils this summer through the National Tutoring Programme (NTP)</h2>

<p>There is still time to support pupils through the NTP. To find out how your school could benefit from tutoring, view our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationaltutoring.org.uk/how-to-guide" rel="external">how to guide</a> on the options available.</p>

<p>Schools should continue to deliver tuition to pupils in 15-hour packages. To allow schools the flexibility to complete as many 15-hour packages as possible before the end of August, you may consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivering more than one session to pupils per week or extending sessions to more than one hour, if appropriate</li>
  <li>continuing tuition in July and August (for schools offering summer tuition)</li>
  <li>allowing pupil swapping to increase the benefit of support to those pupils who need it the most. For example, schools could divide the 15-hour package between two pupils depending on need, with one pupil receiving 10 hours and the second pupil receiving 5 hours</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Prepare for NTP data collection</h3>

<p>Later in June, ESFA will release the ‘School-Led Tutoring: Year-End Statement’. It is mandatory for all schools that received the school-led tutoring (SLT) grant to complete and return it. An optional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">tracker and calculator tool</a> has been designed to help schools track SLT information during the academic year.</p>

<p>We will provide full guidance on completing the Year-End Statement later this month. Page 21 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">School Led Tutoring guidance</a> includes the data you will be asked to provide.</p>
