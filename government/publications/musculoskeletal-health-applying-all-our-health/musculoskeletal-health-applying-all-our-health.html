<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide is part of âAll Our Healthâ, a resource that helps health and care professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. The information below will help frontline health and care professionals use their trusted relationships with patients, families and communities to lower the risk of developing musculoskeletal health (<abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr>) conditions.</p>

<p>We also recommend important actions that managers and staff holding strategic roles can take.</p>

<h2>Access the musculoskeletal health e-learning session</h2>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/605883" rel="external">interactive e-learning version</a> of this topic is now available to use.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) and Health Education Englandâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/" rel="external">e-Learning for Healthcare</a> have developed this content to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to embed prevention in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<h2>Why promote musculoskeletal health in your professional practice?</h2>

<p>Good musculoskeletal health (<abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr>) is an important component of maintaining a personâs functional abilities throughout the life course. It is also fundamental to healthy ageing, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has characterised as âthe process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older ageâ.</p>

<p>Social perceptions of ageing are gradually changing. People increasingly expect to lead independent, active and pain-free lives in their older years. For many people this includes remaining part of the workforce. For most this includes an active retirement, without the fear of pain and falls.</p>

<p><abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions can affect people across the life course. Prevention, early detection and treatment can enable people to live in good health, remain independent and connected to oneâs community. There are also economic advantages for society, such as reducing the pressure on health and social care services and reducing costs as a result of people being unable to work.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/92133/1._Prevalence_of_MSK_conditions_by_UK_country.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>The prevalence of MSK conditions in the UK, all ages, 2017. Northern Ireland: 26.9% (487,200), Scotland: 29% (1,525,000), Wales: 29.3% (887,000), England: 30.1% (15,899,000)</p></figcaption></figure>

<p><abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions are a group of conditions that affect the bones, joints, muscles and spine, and are a common cause of severe long term pain and physical disability. There are 3 groups of <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inflammatory conditions, for example, rheumatoid arthritis</li>
  <li>conditions of <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> pain, for example, osteoarthritis and back pain</li>
  <li>osteoporosis and fragility fractures, for example, a fracture after a fall from standing height</li>
</ul>

<p>While life expectancy has risen, many people are living longer in poorer health â particularly those in more deprived parts of the country. The older a person is, the more likely they are to experience chronic diseases and disabilities such as poor musculoskeletal health.</p>

<p>Each year, 20% of people in the UK see a doctor about a <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> problem. There are multiple risk factors that can heighten peopleâs susceptibility to <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> problems â these include physical inactivity, being overweight or obese, diets deficient in vitamin D or calcium, smoking, older age and genetic predisposition to some <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions.</p>

<p>Seven in 10 people who report living with a long-term <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> condition are overweight or obese:</p>

<p>Fractures, which are often a consequence of a fall, are one of the most serious <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> problems seen in the older population. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/falling-standards-broken-promises-report-national-audit-falls-and-bone-health" rel="external">audit by the Royal College of Physicians</a> found that fractures and falls in people aged 65 and over account for over 4 million hospital bed days each year in England. <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions account for the third-largest area of NHS spend, about Â£5 billion each year.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>The pain and disability of poor <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health limits independence and the ability to participate in family, social and working life. According to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/policy-and-public-affairs/policy-reports/working-with-arthritis-our-policy-report.aspx" rel="external">Versus Arthritis</a>, only 59.4% of people of working age with a <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> condition are in work, and around 1 in 5 people with arthritis has depression.</p>

<p>Office for National Statistics, 2009 to 2019:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In 2020, <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> problems were the second most common cause of sickness absence, which accounted for 20.8 million days lost in work (17.5% of total sickness absence), surpassed only by absence due to minor illness such as cough and colds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> and comorbidities: an important issue</h2>

<p>The term âcomorbidityâ is sometimes used, referring to any additional conditions that people may have, beyond the main one being addressed. The presence of any long-term condition is associated with a drop in quality of life (self-reported Quality of Life score of 0.79), but if arthritis or back pain is present as one of the long-term conditions then the drop is greater (self-reported Quality of Life score of 0.58). Around 4 out of 10 people (36%) with comorbidity are living with a physical and a mental health condition.</p>

<p>By 2025, there will be an estimated 9.1 million people living with one or more long-term conditions in the UK. Four out of five people with osteoarthritis have at least one other long-term condition such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease or depression. Among people over 45 years of age who report living with a major long-term condition, more than 3 out of 10 also have a musculoskeletal condition.</p>

<p>Assessment for people with complex needs requires a joined-up approach â taking into account the physical, social and mental needs of the individual.</p>

<h2>Core principles for healthcare professionals</h2>

<p>This âAll Our Healthâ musculoskeletal health information has been created to help all health professionals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand specific interventions that will encourage individuals to make healthy behaviour changes, to lower the risk of developing <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions and prevent falls</li>
  <li>think about the resources and services available in your area, that can help people to access services that support prevention, early detection and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interventions to prevent the onset of <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr>
</h2>

<p>There are steps that we can take throughout our lives to maintain healthy productive lives, reduce the risk of developing <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions and better manage our health.</p>

<p>Encourage your patients to make healthier lifestyle choices to lower the risk of developing <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions and prevent falls.</p>

<p>Read the case study: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/better-bones-osteoporosis-service-from-kingston-public-health">Better Bones Osteoporosis Service from Kingston Public Health.</a></p>

<h2>Physical activity</h2>

<p>Adults should aim to do activities to develop or maintain muscle strengthening on 2 days per week, engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity each week, according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/physical-activity-guidelines">physical activity guidelines for adults</a> from the UK Chief Medical Officers (<abbr title="Chief Medical Officers">CMOs</abbr>). Adults should also minimise time spent being sedentary and when possible, break up periods of inactivity 
with activity.</p>

<p>All adults should aim to be active daily. Strengthening activities should be in major muscle groups, such as resistance exercises, yoga or carrying heavy shopping. This can help lower the risk of sarcopenia, or loss of muscle mass, which is associated with ageing but can occur in response to immobility at any age.</p>

<p>Moderate intensity physical activities, such as brisk walking or cycling, cause adults to get warmer and breathe harder and their hearts to beat faster, but they can still carry on a conversation.</p>

<p>In older adults, poor muscle strength increases the risk of a fall by 76% and those who have already had a fall are three times more likely to fall again. Activities to improve or maintain muscle strength, balance and flexibility on at least 2 days a week, are therefore important for older adults.</p>

<p>An evidence review commissioned by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/" rel="external">Centre for Ageing Better</a> has found that muscle and bone strengthening and balance activities continue to have great health benefits for all adults, including older adults aged 65 years and over.</p>

<p>Activities found to have the most benefit for muscle and bone strengthening include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ball games</li>
  <li>racket sports</li>
  <li>dance</li>
  <li>Nordic walking</li>
  <li>bowls</li>
  <li>resistance training (usually training with weights, but including body weight exercises which can be performed anywhere)</li>
</ul>

<p>More than 4 in 10 people who report living with a long-term <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> condition are inactive:</p>

<p>Many people with <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions often mistakenly believe that physical activity will make their condition worse when it can actually benefit them. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.versusarthritis.org" rel="external">Versus Arthritis</a> has produced the Musculoskeletal Physical Activity Commissioning Pyramid which sets out the 4 tiers of provision that could be provided to maximise peopleâs opportunities for physical activity. The goal is to reduce symptoms, increase self-efficacy and restore confidence to be more independently physically active.</p>

<h2>Maintain a healthy weight and balanced diet</h2>

<p>Supporting people to maintain a healthy weight â along with advocating the recommendations from the Chief Medical Officers (<abbr title="Chief Medical Officers">CMOs</abbr>) for physical activity across the life course â can reduce the risks of developing <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions such as back and neck pain and osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.</p>

<p>People with a healthy weight are less likely to develop osteoarthritis of the knee than those who are obese.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/528193/Eatwell_guide_colour.pdf">healthy balanced diet</a> is also important for <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/healthy-bones/Pages/how-to-build-strong-bones-for-life.aspx" rel="external">good bone health</a> to prevent osteoporosis in later life. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-vitamin-d-and-health-report">Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN)</a> identifies vitamin D and calcium as important dietary components for <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health through maintaining healthy bones, teeth and muscles.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> advises that in spring and summer, the majority of the population get enough vitamin D through sunlight on the skin and a healthy, balanced diet. During autumn and winter, everyone will need to rely on dietary sources of vitamin D. Since it is difficult for people to meet the 10 microgram recommendation from consuming foods naturally containing or fortified with vitamin D, people are advised to consider taking a daily supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin D in autumn and winter.</p>

<p>People whose skin has little or no exposure to the sun, like those in institutions such as care homes, or who always cover their skin when outside, risk vitamin D deficiency and need to take a supplement throughout the year. Ethnic minority groups with dark skin, from African, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian backgrounds, may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight in the summer and therefore should consider taking a supplement all year round.</p>

<p>Calcium is needed for good bone health. Eating a diet consistent with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide">Eatwell Guide</a> will provide all the calcium your body needs.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>

<p>Smokers and ex-smokers experience 60% more pain in the back, neck and legs and a 114% increase in disabling lower back pain.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-progressive-decline-of-the-bodys-major-systems">review showed that smoking plays a role in the progressive decline of the bodyâs major systems, including <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Smoking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is associated with poorer development of the hip, spine and neck, and lower bone mineral density among men as young as 18 to 20</li>
  <li>has a particularly greater impact on reduced bone mineral density among postmenopausal women</li>
  <li>is associated with more bone fractures and slower healing and is associated with up to a 40% increase in the risk of hip fractures among men</li>
  <li>is a significant cause of rheumatoid arthritis, especially among men, and can also reduce the impact of treatment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mental wellbeing</h2>

<p>Mental health conditions can increase the likelihood of developing some <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> disorders. For example, people with depression are at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15711224" rel="external">greater risk of developing back pain.</a>  <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> conditions can also have a significant impact on mental health as living with a painful condition can lead to anxiety and depression, and depression is 4 times more common among people in persistent pain compared with those without pain.</p>

<p>A recent study found that 33.9% of older adults (over 50) with <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> pain also have persistent anxiety issues and 22% have a persistent depression problem. Mental health also has an impact on a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.jpsychores.com/article/S0022-3999(15)00463-8/abstract" rel="external">personâs ability to deal with an <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> problem.</a></p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/msk" rel="external">Fingertips tool</a> identifies the level of anxiety and depression in those with <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> by ethnicity and deprivation - highlighting the links with inequalities.</p>

<h2>Taking Action</h2>

<h3>If youâre a frontline health professional</h3>

<p>All healthcare practitioners should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider how they can influence behaviour to improve <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://meccback.co.uk/back-pain-the-facts/" rel="external">making every contact count (<abbr title="Making Every Contact Count">MECC</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>raise awareness about the positive actions â such as strength and balance type activity â that individuals can take to look after their bones, muscles and joints across and during their life</li>
  <li>provide information to enable individuals who may be at risk, or have developed early signs of an <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> disorder, to access appropriate help and support in a timely manner</li>
  <li>encourage behavior change, through the use of evidence-based interventions</li>
  <li>ensure that people with comorbidities can take part in a care and support planning process, using standardised tools to explore and record pain and functional limitations â and that they understand how these affect their daily activities</li>
</ul>

<h3>If youâre a team leader or manager</h3>

<p>Team leaders or managers should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote a team culture where staff know that they should talk to their patients about healthy lifestyles â  âMaking Every Contact Countâ initiatives should include musculoskeletal health</li>
  <li>use the <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> core skills and capabilities framework to identify the training and development needs of your workforce. Raising the standards for a quality based service approach</li>
  <li>ensure all employees are aware of the tools and resources to assist in raising awareness about the main risk factors associated with <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health, and signpost to the support available in the local area such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou#vYGksMGzqSfuF4eM.97" rel="external">One You</a> resources and <abbr title="Making Every Contact Count">MECC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>promote the use of the <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> <abbr title="return on investment">ROI</abbr> Toolkit, alerting commissioners and providers to the benefits of scaling up the interventions like Escape Pain</li>
  <li>promote the use of tools and resources to support employers and employees such as the <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> Employers Toolkit and the Mental Health Employers Toolkit</li>
  <li>facilitate access to local physical activity provision for those with an <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> condition</li>
  <li>ensure all employees are aware of local <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> protocols and care pathways to avoid delay in referral for assessment and treatment</li>
</ul>

<h3>If youâre a senior leader</h3>

<p>Senior leaders should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> in health and wellbeing boardsâ Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (<abbr title="Joint Strategic Needs Assessment">JSNA</abbr>) and <abbr title="sustainability and transformation plan">STP</abbr> discussions, including planning for complex needs such as people who have more than one long term condition</li>
  <li>promote work with local authorities to ensure the availability of accessible community facilities (as per the physical activity pyramid) including natural environments, cycle lanes, for example, across all areas in the locality, including the most deprived. Ensuring provision in these areas may support the reduction of inequalities as evidence suggests there is inequitable access across populations</li>
  <li>consider the <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> needs of the local workforce, to create a culture whereby the physical and mental wellbeing needs of the workforce are a priority. All employees are encouraged to report any issues relating to musculoskeletal health at an early stage</li>
  <li>include <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health in the education and training needs of the workforce, to equip them to deliver high-quality <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> advice and interventions</li>
  <li>promote the use of evidence-based interventions, through influencing commissioners and strategic leaders in the organisation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/musculoskeletal-conditions-return-on-investment-tool">return on investment tool</a>
</li>
  <li>support the scale-up of best practice examples</li>
  <li>encourage high-level, executive staff to act as <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> workplace champions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measuring impact</h2>

<p>As a health professional there are a range of reasons why it is important to measure your impact and demonstrate the value of your contribution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record, report and share improvements in your patients <abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr> health and behaviour changes you might measure as a result of your practice</li>
  <li>use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/policy-and-public-affairs/resources-for-policy-makers/for-healthcare-practitioners-and-commissioners/msk-hq.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="musculoskeletal">MSK</abbr>- HQ Patient Questionnaire</a> to monitor improvement</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact.html" rel="external">âEveryday Interactions measuring impact toolkitâ</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health care professionals to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding local needs</h2>

<p><abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>âs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/msk" rel="external">Musculoskeletal Conditions profile</a> provides local data on prevalence rates and risk factors to enable commissioners to understand the unique health needs of local populations.</p>

<p>The profile is accompanied by the Musculoskeletal conditions: return on investment tool to help local commissioners provide cost-effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
