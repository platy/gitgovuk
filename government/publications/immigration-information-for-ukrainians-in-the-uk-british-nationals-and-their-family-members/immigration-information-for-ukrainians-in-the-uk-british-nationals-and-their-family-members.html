<p>The United Kingdom is standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine. The Ukraine Family Scheme is open now for applications, for immediate and extended family members of British nationals, and people settled in the UK.</p>

<p>For information on the Homes for Ukraine Scheme, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk" rel="external">please check GOV.UK</a></p>

<h2>The Ukraine Family Scheme - general information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On Friday 4 March 2022, the UK launched the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Ukraine Family Scheme allows immediate and extended family members of British nationals, people settled in the UK, and certain others resident here, to come to the country.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those granted under the scheme will be granted a visa that lasts three years, giving them certainty and ensuring their future in the country.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is free and does not include any salary or language requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those applying to the Ukraine Family Scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>must be applying to join or accompany a UK-based family member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>must be Ukrainian or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>must have been residing in Ukraine on or immediately before 1 January 2022 (including those who have now left Ukraine).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals can apply if they have already arrived in the UK and meet the requirements above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications made under the Ukraine Family Scheme will be prioritised by the Home Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application forms must be completed for each family member, including one application per child.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is crucial that customers provide a valid e-mail address when submitting their online application, as we will need to contact them with more guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those applying from outside the UK, should await a decision before travelling to the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All applications will be subject to security checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications are being fast tracked and additional staff have been surged across our Visa Application Centres (VAC) in Europe to process applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guidance on how to make an application to the Ukraine Family Scheme and which family members are eligible can be found on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa#eligibility">www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa#eligibility</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To access our 24/7 helpline call (+44 (0)808 164 8810 - select option 1).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>If you are a Ukrainian international passport holder</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>From 15 March 2022, holders of valid Ukrainian international passports who are outside the UK are not required to provide their biometric information from overseas when making applications under the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All applicants need to complete an online application form, but they do not need to attend an in-person appointment at a VAC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Border Force, airlines and carriers have been informed that individuals with valid Ukrainian international passports who have been accepted under the Ukraine Family Scheme will be issued with a letter granting them permission to travel, rather than a UK visa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On arrival in the UK, the individual should present their letter to Border Force who will endorse their passport with a six-month entry stamp that evidences their right to work, study and claim benefits in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once in the UK, individuals will be able to make an application to extend their stay (for up to 36 months) and be issued with secure evidence of status.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals who have already completed an application before 15 March 2022 and havenât received their visa will be contacted as soon as possible.â¯</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals who have already given their biometrics at a VAC should ensure they obtain a visa in their passport from when they submitted their biometrics and do not attempt to travel before that happens.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Application process for individuals with a valid Ukrainian international passport</h2>

<p>Individuals applying for a visa with a valid Ukrainian international passport will need to:</p>

<p>1. Start an application online at: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/UFS">www.gov.uk/UFS</a></p>

<p>2. They will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A photograph of their passport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An official document to confirm their relationship to their UK-based family member, for example a marriage or birth certificate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3. They will receive a letter or email from the Home Office confirming they can travel to the UK.</p>

<p>4. They can then make their way to any UK border point and enter the UK, with their letter confirmation.</p>

<h2>Application process for individuals who do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport</h2>

<p>Individuals applying for a visa who do not hold a valid Ukrainian international passport will need to:</p>

<p>1. Complete an online application form: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/UFS">www.gov.uk/UFS</a></p>

<p>2. Book an appointment at any VAC in Europe: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre.">www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre</a></p>

<p>3. Attend a VAC appointment for accelerated security checks.</p>

<p>4. Remain in the location where they submitted their application until we contact them.</p>

<p>5. We will contact the applicant immediately once their visa application has been processed.</p>

<h2>Further information on applying to come to the UK from Europe</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ukrainian nationals have visa free access to Schengen states, which enables them to reach safe neighbouring countries from which they can make their applications to come to the UK.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ukrainian nationals already in the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals can apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme if they are eligible and in the UK online at: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/UFS">www.gov.uk/UFS</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will then need to book and attend an appointment at a UK Visa and Citizenship Application Services (UKVCAS) service point in the UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/UKVCAS.">www.gov.uk/UKVCAS</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals on work, study or visit visas in the UK are able to switch onto different visa routes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing points-based immigration system route can extend the duration of their stay in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing visitor visa can exceptionally switch into a points-based immigration system route without having to leave the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals on an existing visitor visa can also apply under the normal family route to extend the duration of their stay without meeting the immigration status requirement, provided they meet the requirements based on exceptional circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Homes for Ukraine scheme</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows people seeking sanctuary with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home, such as a spare room or unoccupied residential self-contained unit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no limit on this scheme, it is open to Ukrainian nationals and immediate family members of Ukrainian nationals, and we will welcome as many Ukrainians as wish to come and that have matched sponsors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals arriving under this scheme are able to live and work in the UK for up to three years and access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education and other support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sponsors can be of any nationality, with any immigration status, provided they have at least six monthsâ leave to remain in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sponsors are asked to provide accommodation for a minimum of six months and will be offered an optional âthank youâ payment of Â£350 per month to people who can accommodate one or more household for up to 12 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme opened on Friday 18 March 2022. Either the sponsor or the Ukrainian being sponsored can apply on GOV.UK, completing a single form which collects both sidesâ details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Potential sponsors can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">register their interest, receive updates and information on how to apply on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Safe and legal routes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Home Office also has several other safe and legal routes under the points-based immigration system which could be used by Ukrainian nationals to reach the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals can get visas to work and study in the UK through the points-based immigration system, such as via the Skilled Worker, Student or Graduate routes or the Health and Care Worker visa.</p>
