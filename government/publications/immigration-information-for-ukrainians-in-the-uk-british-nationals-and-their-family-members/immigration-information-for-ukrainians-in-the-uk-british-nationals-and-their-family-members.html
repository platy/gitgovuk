<h2>The Ukraine Family Scheme - general information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Ukraine Family Scheme allows immediate and extended family members of British nationals, people settled in the UK, and certain others resident here, to come to, or remain in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals arriving under this scheme are able to live and work in the UK for up to three years and access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education and other support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is free and does not include any salary or language requirements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those applying to the Ukraine Family Scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>must be applying to join or accompany a UK-based family member.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>must be Ukrainian or the immediate family member of a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa#eligibility">A definition of immediate family members</a> is available on GOV.UK</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals with a valid Ukrainian international passport can use the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app when applying for their visa, to prove their identity and provide their biometric information. As part of this digital application process, they will be granted with an eVisa to evidence their immigration status in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-information-for-ukrainians-in-the-uk-your-next-steps">Further information about the next steps individuals need to take once they are in the UK and how to evidence their immigration status</a> is available on GOV.UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals can apply if they have already arrived in the UK and meet the requirements above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications made under the Ukraine Family Scheme will be prioritised by the Home Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application forms must be completed for each family member, including one application per child.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is crucial that customers provide a valid e-mail address when submitting their online application, as we will need to contact them with more guidance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those applying from outside the UK, should await a decision before travelling to the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All applications will be subject to security checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications are being fast tracked and additional staff have been surged across our Visa Application Centres (VAC) in Europe to process applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guidance on how to make an application to the Ukraine Family Scheme and which family members are eligible can be found on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/UFS">www.gov.uk/UFS</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Homes for Ukraine scheme</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows people seeking sanctuary with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home, such as a spare room or unoccupied residential self-contained unit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no limit on this scheme, it is open to Ukrainian nationals and immediate family members of Ukrainian nationals, and we will welcome as many Ukrainians that wish to come and that have matched sponsors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applicants must be 18 years old or older on the date of application. Those under 18 years old must make an application and travel to the UK with their parent or legal guardian, or be joining a parent or legal guardian in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals with a valid Ukrainian international passport can use the ‘UK Immigration: ID check’ app when applying for their visa, to prove their identity and provide their biometric information. As part of this digital application process, they will be granted with an eVisa to evidence their immigration status in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-information-for-ukrainians-in-the-uk-your-next-steps">Further information about the next steps individuals need to take once they are in the UK and how to evidence their immigration status</a> is available on GOV.UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals arriving under this scheme are able to live and work in the UK for up to three years and access healthcare, benefits, employment support, education and other support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sponsors can be of any nationality, with any immigration status, provided they have at least six months’ leave to remain in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sponsors are asked to provide accommodation for a minimum of six months and will be offered an optional ‘thank you’ payment of £350 per month to people who can accommodate one or more household for up to 12 months.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme opened on Friday 18 March 2022. Either the sponsor or the Ukrainian being sponsored can apply on GOV.UK, completing a single form which collects both sides’ details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Potential sponsors can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk/" rel="external">register their interest, receive updates and information on how to apply on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Ukraine Extension Scheme</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals in the UK who have temporary visas, including work, study or visit visas can apply to the Ukraine Extension Scheme free of charge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainians who had visas on or before 18 March 2022, or visas which expired on or after 1 January 2022, can apply. Their partner and children can also apply if they are already in the UK as ‘dependants’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Under the Ukraine Extension Scheme, individuals will get three years leave to remain in the UK and will have the right to work, study and access public funds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This scheme is currently not a route to settlement. Individuals who have leave on a route to settlement should consider carefully whether the Ukraine Extension Scheme would be the right route for them to apply for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals on work, study or visit visas in the UK are also able to switch onto different visa routes, such as the Ukraine Family Scheme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To access our helpline call (+44 (0)808 164 8810 - select option 1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guidance on how to apply is on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme">www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-stay-in-the-uk-under-the-ukraine-extension-scheme</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Further information on applying to come to the UK from Europe</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ukrainian nationals have visa free access to Schengen states, which enables them to reach safe neighbouring countries from which they can make their applications to come to the UK.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other safe and legal routes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Home Office also has several other safe and legal routes under the points-based immigration system which could be used by Ukrainian nationals to reach the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ukrainian nationals can get visas to work and study in the UK through the points-based immigration system, such as via the Skilled Worker, Student or Graduate routes or the Health and Care Worker visa.</p>
