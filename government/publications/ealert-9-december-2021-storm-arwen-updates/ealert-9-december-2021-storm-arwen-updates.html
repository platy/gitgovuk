<span class="number">1. </span>Mental health benefits of visiting UK Woodland’s estimated at £185 million</h2>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/valuing-the-mental-health-benefits-of-woodlands/" class="govuk-link">A landmark report</a>&nbsp;by Forest Research, published on Saturday 4 December, has found that visits to the UK’s woodlands boosts mental health and is estimated to save £185 million in treatment costs annually.</p>

<p>For England specifically, woodlands save £141 million costs associated with mental health illnesses, including visits to GPs, drug prescriptions, inpatient care, social services and the number of days lost due to mental health issues. The figures are based on evidence of the reduced incidence of depression and anxiety resulting from regular visits to woodlands.</p>

<p>Forestry Commission Chair, Sir William Worsley, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This report demonstrates just how vital it is to invest in healthy trees and woodlands. It makes medical sense, because it will mean better health for all; economic sense, by saving society millions of pounds and it makes environmental sense, helping us to tackle the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Storm Arwen: impact report</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Help us improve our understanding of the economic and environmental damage caused by Storm Arwen.</h3>

<p>The Forestry Commission is working with the sector to respond to the impact of Storm Arwen. It is clear that there have been some significant impacts across the North of England and Scotland. The current focus is on the restoration of power and access to those affected by the storm by the relevant statutory authorities. We are starting to assess the wider impact and recognise the importance of promoting a safety first approach (think safe, stay safe). This includes carefully considering the risks associated with windblown trees and seeking trained professional help for any work needed.</p>

<p>As part of our response we are gathering information on the area of woodland and volume of timber blown down. We are using a variety of sources of information including working with Forest Research to use earth observation satellite data. Early indications from surveys carried out by Forestry Commission staff suggest that more than 1000ha of woodland is likely to have been blown down and potentially in excess of 0.5million m3 of timber damaged. Preliminary reports suggest that there has been some regionally significant impacts following the initial assessments from Forestry England.</p>

<p>To help us improve our understanding of the economic and environmental damage caused by the storm we would like you to share information you have on damage sustained by woodlands you own or manage. If you would like to help us please take a minute to answer these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what is the six figure Ordnance Survey grid reference and postcode for the location of your woodland?</li>
  <li>what is the total estimated area and volume of windthrow across the holding (if there is more than one woodland on the holding, please submit the sum area and sum volume damaged)?</li>
  <li>what main tree species are present in the damaged woodland?</li>
  <li>do you have a current felling licence for the affected woodland?</li>
  <li>do you plan to harvest or remove the windblown trees?</li>
  <li>do you have any plans to restock the site?</li>
  <li>do you a windblow recovery plan for the sites affected?</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please send your responses to <a href="mailto:storm.arwen@forestrycommission.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">storm.arwen@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a> by 23 January 2022. We aim to produce a map and short report describing the impact of Storm Arwen in late February and will share key findings via eAlert.</p>
</div>

<p>Woodland owners and managers who may be concerned or need help or advice about storm damage to their woodland should contact their Agent or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening#area-offices">local Forestry Commission Area Office</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Storm Arwen: requirements for a licence for areas of windblown trees in England</h2>
<p>Some damaged trees may be exempt from needing a licence and still be economic to harvest from the woodland. Those trees posing a real danger to public right of ways, roads and services should be dealt with and would be exempt from our regulations.</p>

<p>The legal harvesting of affected timber is an important consideration for supply chains and land managers should consider applying for a felling licence for all affected areas to help meet chain of custody requirements.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tree-felling-getting-permission">Full details of the exemptions available and how to apply for a felling licence are included on our website.</a></p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Countryside Stewardship Woodland Creation Grant closes to new applications</h2>
<p>The Countryside Stewardship (<abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr>) Woodland Creation Grant is closing to new applications on 31 December 2021. You will still be able to apply to create woodland through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-woodland-creation-offer">England Woodland Creation Offer (<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>)</a> which is open for applications.</p>

<p>If you currently have a <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Woodland Creation grant you can continue with the capital works as agreed with the Forestry Commission. You will be invited to apply for the 10 year <abbr title="Countryside Stewardship">CS</abbr> Woodland Creation Maintenance agreement when the capital works are complete.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Updates on the England Woodland Creation Offer (<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>)</h2>
<p>In October we shared news of how we were working through the high numbers of <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> applications. We are continuing this work to turn as many applications as possible into agreements to support planting this winter season. To achieve as much as possible we are continuing to prioritise complete applications that we and our delivery partners (e.g., the Community Forests) have already received to plant.</p>

<p>While we continue to build our capacity to process applications, it currently takes three to five months to process a complete and valid application. As a result, applications not yet received will not lead to agreements in time to plant this winter.</p>

<p>Once we have issued as many agreements for this winter as possible, we will return our attention to those <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> applications for planting next season and that we have yet to receive, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-creation-planning-grant" class="govuk-link">Woodland Creation Planning Grant applications</a>.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Forestry Learning Mechanism scoping study: Invitation to Quote</h2>
<p>To support the delivery of the Nature for Climate Fund, there needs to be a significant increase in the provision, co-ordination and take-up of forestry skills, training and education.</p>

<p>We are procuring a scoping survey to help us better understand which mechanism, organisation, platform, network, model or approach would best be able to deliver this increase.</p>

<p>The period for the Invitation to Quote will run until 5:00pm on Friday 17 December. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-learning-mechanism-scoping-study-invitation-to-quote" class="govuk-link">More information is available online.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Updated Forestry Commission agent authority form</h2>
<p>We’ve updated the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commission-agent-authority-form" class="govuk-link">Forestry Commission Agent Authority Form</a>. This is the form you can use to grant an agent permission to submit an application or manage an agreement on your behalf. A full list of applications the form can be used for is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commission-agent-authority-form" class="govuk-link">available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>We have made changes to the form to help us provide a better service for all applications where agent permissions are needed.</p>

<p>We listened to the feedback from the Agent’s Focus Group that the specific listing of grants on the form was restrictive because it meant that a new form had to be completed for every new grant introduced.  As a resolution, we have adapted the form so that it can be used for future grants.  We have also introduced the option for you to select whether the authority relates to past applications, future applications, or both.</p>

<p>We also now accept certified Adobe Sign electronic signatures on the agent authority form as well as handwritten (wet) signatures. Instructions on how to complete the form are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/forestry-commission-agent-authority-form" class="govuk-link">available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
