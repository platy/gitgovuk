<p>A communications pack for partners, with information and resources to help travellers to and from the UK prepare for the changes to the rules.</p>

<h2>About this guide</h2>

<p>The UK has left the European Union (EU) and the Brexit Transition period ended on 31 December 2020. This means there are some changes to the rules for travellers to and from the UK.</p>

<p>This pack explains the rules for travel to and from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and to and from Northern Ireland (NI).</p>

<p>Important partners like you can help us spread the word by telling your customers about these changes.</p>

<p>Please tell your customers about the relevant changes and if they need to do anything differently. To make this easier for you, we’ve prepared communications resources you can download, copy or print including social media assets, poster messages, passenger announcement scripts and short videos. They can be found at the end of this pack.</p>

<p>This is part of a wider HM Government communications campaign to make sure businesses and individuals know about important changes that came into force 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>What travellers need to know</h3>

<p>We want to make it as straightforward as possible for people to continue.</p>

<p>We want to make it as straightforward as possible for people to continue shopping and carrying cash when they travel to and from the UK. This pack summarises certain changes travellers will need to know about when they’re carrying:</p>

<ul>
  <li>goods for personal use</li>
  <li>commercial goods or samples for their business in their accompanied luggage or private vehicle, known as ‘Merchandise in Baggage’</li>
  <li>£10,000 or €10,000, or more, in cash</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we want you to know</h3>

<p>The changes outlined in this pack are the new rules for travellers buying goods for personal use, carrying goods for use in their business and carrying cash.</p>

<p>We aim to minimise queues and to keep people and traffic flowing as freely as possible at our ports, airports and cross-channel rail ports.</p>

<h4>New online services</h4>

<p>To help in this, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has developed an online declaration service to help travellers, with goods for personal use, check taxes and duties that may be due, declare goods and pay any tax or duty due. They can do this before arrival into Great Britain. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-personal-goods-into-uk" class="govuk-link">new online declaration service</a>.</p>

<p>If you need assisted digital support to make your declaration, you can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> helpline on 0300 322 9434, Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm. Outside these hours, use the red channel or phone at the port or airport.</p>

<p>When bringing in goods for business use (also called ‘Merchandise in Baggage’) between GB and the EU that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>below the value of £1,500 and 1,000 kilograms in weight</li>
  <li>not classed as excise or controlled goods</li>
</ul>

<p>travellers can use the new online declarations service at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bringing-commercial-goods-into-great-britainin-your-baggage">www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage</a>.</p>

<h2>Travelling to the UK</h2>

<p>A summary of changes from 1 January 2021</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: from EU and non-EU countries to GB</h3>

<p>Following the end of the Brexit Transition period, those travelling to and from the EU to GB are now treated the same as those travelling to and from non-EU countries.</p>

<p>This means there are some changes for these travellers. From 1 January 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimum Indicative Levels (MILs) establish if goods are for personal use no longer apply</li>
  <li>Passengers travelling from the EU are subject to personal allowances, the same as non-EU passengers</li>
  <li>If passengers exceed their personal allowances, they will need to pay tax/duty on all the goods in that category, not just the excess amount, the same as non-EU passengers</li>
</ul>

<p>The Free Trade Agreement with the EU means passengers travelling from the EU who exceed their personal allowances may be eligible for a preferential customs duty rate of 0% if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods ‘originate’ (are made or produced) in the EU</li>
  <li>they buy the goods in the EU</li>
  <li>they bring the goods into GB direct from the EU</li>
</ul>

<p>If passengers use the online service to declare goods, the 0% preferential duty rate will be automatically applied based on their responses. If passengers declare at the border, the Border Force Officer will also apply the 0% preferential duty rate based on the information provided. VAT and excise duty may also be due.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-personal-goods-into-uk">more information on claiming a preferential rate of customs duty</a>.</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: for EU and non-EU passengers travelling to GB</h3>

<p>When travelling to GB your personal allowances are as below. If you exceed these allowances, you must pay tax and/or duty on all of the goods in that category, not just the value or quantity above the allowance.</p>

<h4>Alcohol</h4>

<ul>
  <li>42 litres of beer</li>
  <li>18 litres of still wine</li>
  <li>4 litres of spirit or 9 litres of sparkling wine, fortified wine (eg sherry or port) or any alcoholic beverage of less than 22% <abbr title="Alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can split this last allowance. For example, if you bring in 4.5 litres of fortified wine (50% of your full allowance of 9 litres), then you may also bring in 2 litres of spirits (50% of your full allowance of 4 litres) to make up your 100% allowance in this category. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Tobacco</h4>

<ul>
  <li>200 cigarettes OR</li>
  <li>100 cigarillos OR</li>
  <li>50 cigars OR</li>
  <li>250g tobacco OR</li>
  <li>200 sticks of tobacco for heating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine the above allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example, if you only bring in 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200), you may also bring in 25 cigars (50% of your full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Any other goods</h4>

<p>£390, or £270 if travelling by private plane or boat.</p>

<h3>Carrying commercial goods (Merchandise in Baggage) in accompanied luggage or a small motor vehicle: from EU to GB</h3>

<p>Merchandise in Baggage means commercial goods intended for trade or business use, carried in accompanied luggage or a small motor vehicle.</p>

<p>For goods below £1,500 in value and 1,000 kilograms in weight, excluding excise and controlled goods: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/restricted-goods-merchandise-in-baggage">Check what is a controlled good</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>travellers make a simple online declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay duty or tax due up to 5 working days before arriving in GB. See: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage" class="govuk-link">Bringing commercial goods into Great Britain in your baggage</a>
</li>
  <li>travellers can also declare goods and pay duty and tax due using the red channel or red phone where these exist, in the same way as travellers from non-EU countries currently do</li>
</ul>

<p>For goods above £1,500 in value or 1,000 kilograms in weight, or excise/controlled goods of any value/weight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travellers or their agents submit a full electronic customs declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> before arriving in GB. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage">Bringing commercial goods into Great Britain in your baggage</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 January 2022, if you are carrying your goods in a goods vehicle, such as a van, and the goods are over a value of £1,500, then a pre-lodged safety and security declaration is required to be submitted to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, either by yourself if you have the appropriate software or through a customs agent, in addition to a full customs import declaration.</p>

<h3>Controls on cash: from EU to GB</h3>

<p>Those travelling into GB from the EU with £10,000 or more in cash will need to make a declaration.</p>

<p>They should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bringing-cash-into-uk" class="govuk-link">make a declaration online</a>,where they’ll find more information about cash controls. Travellers needing assisted digital support to make a declaration can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Helpline on 0300 322 9434, Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.</p>

<p>Alternatively, at ports and airports where there is a red channel, paper declarations will be available. If there is no red channel a red point phone can be used if available.</p>

<p>Please note, cash includes notes and coins, bearer bonds, bankers’ drafts and cheques.</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: from EU to NI</h3>

<p>When travelling to NI from the EU there are no changes to the rules.</p>

<p>You can continue to bring unlimited amounts of alcohol and tobacco providing it is for personal use or a gift and must have been transported by you.</p>

<p>Although there are no limits to the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring in from EU countries, you are more likely to be asked questions if you carry more than the following amounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>800 cigarettes; 200 cigars; 400 cigarillos; 1 kilogram of tobacco; 110 litres of beer</li>
  <li>90 litres of wine; 10 litres of spirits; 20 litres of fortified wine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Carrying commercial goods (Merchandise in Baggage) in accompanied luggage or a small motor vehicle: from EU to NI</h3>

<p>There are no declaration requirements to carry commercial goods from EU to NI.</p>

<h3>Controls on cash: from EU to NI</h3>

<p>Declarations will not be required when carrying any amount of cash between the EU and NI.</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: from non-EU countries to NI</h3>

<p>When travelling to NI from non-EU countries your personal allowances are as below. If you exceed these allowances, you must pay tax and/or duty on all of the goods in that category, not just the value or quantity above the allowance.</p>

<h4>Alcohol</h4>

<ul>
  <li>16 litres of beer</li>
  <li>4 litres of still wine</li>
  <li>1 litre of spirit or other liquors over 22% <abbr title="Alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr> OR 2 litres of fortified wine (for example, port and sherry), sparkling wine and alcoholic drinks up to 22% <abbr title="Alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can split this last allowance. For example if you bring in 1 litre of fortified wine (50% of your full allowance of 2 litres) then you may also bring in half a litre of spirits (50% of your full allowance of 1 litre) to make up your 100% allowance in this category. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Tobacco</h4>

<ul>
  <li>200 cigarettes or</li>
  <li>100 cigarillos or</li>
  <li>50 cigars or</li>
  <li>250g tobacco or</li>
  <li>200 sticks of tobacco for heating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine the above allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example if you only bring in 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200) you may also bring in 25 cigars (50% of your full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Any other goods</h4>

<p>£390, or £270 if travelling by private plane or boat.</p>

<h3>Cash Controls: from non-EU to NI</h3>

<p>Declarations are required when cash of €10,000 or more is brought into NI from any country outside the EU. These requirements will continue to apply in NI.</p>

<h2>Travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h2>

<p>A summary of changes from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: from GB to NI</h3>

<p>UK residents do not have to declare goods that they carry from GB to NI, unless VAT and/or excise duty has not been paid on the goods and they exceed certain allowances.</p>

<p>Non-UK residents travelling from GB to NI must declare goods they are carrying if they exceed their allowances and may have to pay customs duty, if their goods do not qualify for relief. They will only have to pay VAT and/or excise duty if this has not already been paid in the UK.</p>

<p>Travellers can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-personal-goods-into-uk" class="govuk-link">check allowance details, make a declaration and pay any tax and duty due</a> using the new online service.</p>

<h3>Carrying Commercial Goods (Merchandise in Baggage) in accompanied luggage or a small motor vehicle: from GB to NI</h3>

<p>You (or someone dealing with customs for you) will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get an EORI number.</li>
  <li>declare the goods to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> through the free to use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss" rel="external">Trader Support Service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to declare</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has provided a free to use <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss">Trader Support Service</a>. Any declarations can be made through that service regardless of the value or the nature of the goods.</p>

<p>You can make an oral declaration if your port of entry has the appropriate facilities and your goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a value less than £873</li>
  <li>weigh less than 1,000 kilograms</li>
  <li>are subject to any prohibition and restriction including alcohol, tobacco or fuel (excise goods)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your goods are not eligible for an oral declaration, or there are not the facilities for an oral declaration at your port of entry, then you should use the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss">Trader Support Service</a>.</p>

<h2>Travelling from the UK to another country</h2>

<p>A summary of changes from 1 January 2021 (this covers GB to EU and non-EU countries and NI to EU and non-EU countries).</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: taking goods out of GB</h3>

<p>Following the end of the Brexit Transition period, those travelling to the EU from GB are now treated the same as those travelling to non-EU countries. This means there are some changes for these travellers:</p>

<p>Up to 31 December 2020 those travelling to the EU could take unlimited amounts of duty and tax paid goods for personal use. Minimum indicative levels (MILs) served as a guide to establish whether goods were for personal use.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021 MILs no longer apply and passengers travelling from GB to the EU are subject to the EU rules for non-EU passengers. Details are on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/%20carry/alcohol-tobacco-cash/index_en.htm">the Europa website</a>.</p>

<p>Travellers departing from GB to the EU are able to buy duty free excise goods once they have passed security controls at airports, ports, and international rail terminals on the same basis as applies to passengers travelling to non-EU destinations. This means those travelling from GB don’t have to pay UK tax and excise duty on alcohol and tobacco they take with them when they leave. You should check the personal allowances of the country of destination before you travel.</p>

<h3>Carrying commercial goods (Merchandise in Baggage) or in accompanied vehicle: exporting out of GB</h3>

<p>Merchandise in baggage means commercial goods intended for trade or business use, carried in a passenger’s accompanied luggage or a small motor vehicle.</p>

<p>For goods below £1,500 in value and 1,000 kilograms in weight, excluding excise and controlled goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>travellers make a simple online declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and pay duty or tax due up to 5 working days before departing Great Britain. Full details are at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage">www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at ports and airports with a red channel or red phone available, travellers can also declare goods and pay duty and tax due as travellers going to non-EU countries currently do</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For goods above £1,500 in value or 1,000kg in weight, or excise/controlled goods of any value/weight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at any port: travellers or their agents must submit a full electronic customs declaration to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> before leaving Great Britain. Full details are at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bringing-commercial-goods-into-great-britainin-your-baggage">www.gov.uk/hmrc/goods-in-baggage</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controls on cash: when leaving GB to outside the UK from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Those travelling to any country from GB with £10,000 or more in cash will need to make a declaration.</p>

<p>They should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bringing-cash-into-uk" class="govuk-link">make a declaration online</a>, where they’ll find more information about cash controls. Travellers needing assisted digital support to make a declaration can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Helpline on 0300 322 9434, Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you cannot use the online service to make your declaration you can ask for a paper form BOR9011 at the port or airport and post it in the drop box at the port or airport.</p>

<p>Please note, cash includes notes and coins, bearer bonds, banker’s drafts and cheques.</p>

<h3>Goods for personal use: taking goods from NI to EU and non-EU countries</h3>

<h4>To EU countries</h4>

<p>There are no changes for those travelling from NI to EU countries. This means they will still be able to take unlimited amounts of tax and duty-paid alcohol, tobacco and other goods.</p>

<h4>To non-EU countries</h4>

<p>From 1 Jan 2021, rules for travellers from NI to non-EU countries remain the same. This means those travelling outside of the EU are still able to purchase duty-free alcohol and tobacco before travelling. You should check the personal allowances of the country of destination before you travel.</p>

<h3>Carrying commercial goods (Merchandise in Baggage) or in accompanied vehicle: exporting from NI to EU and non-EU Countries</h3>

<h4>NI - EU</h4>

<p>There will be no customs declarations or processes.</p>

<h4>NI - Non-EU/Rest of world</h4>

<p>For goods above the value of £873 and 1,000 kilograms in weight, or classed as excise or controlled goods travellers or their agents must declare the goods to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> through the free to use <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tradersupportservice.co.uk/tss">Trader Support Service</a></p>

<p>For goods below the value of £873 and 1,000 kilograms in weight, excluding excise or controlled goods, travellers can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an oral declaration where there is a red channel port or red point phone</li>
  <li>a declaration by conduct</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controls on cash: from NI to EU and non-EU countries from January 2021</h3>

<p>When going to another country from NI, outside the EU, travellers must make a cash declaration if they are carrying €10,000 (or the equivalent in another currency) or more in cash.</p>

<p>When travelling from NI to GB, no cash declaration is required.</p>

<p>They should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bringing-cash-into-uk" class="govuk-link">make a declaration online</a>, where they’ll find more information about cash controls. Passengers needing assisted digital support to make a declaration can call the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Helpline on 0300 322 9434, Monday to Friday, 8am too 6pm.</p>

<p>Alternatively, at ports and airports where there is a red channel, paper declarations will be available. If there is no red channel a red point phone can be used if available.</p>

<p>Please note, cash includes notes and coins, bearer bonds, banker’s drafts and cheques.</p>

<h3>Links to other information for travellers</h3>

<h4>Passports</h4>

<p>Different passport validity rules will apply for British Citizen passport holders when visiting Europe. Travellers must check their passport validity online using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-a-passport-travel-europe-1-january-2021" class="govuk-link">our passport checker</a> as they may need to renew it earlier than planned. This does not apply to Ireland.</p>

<h4>Travel insurance</h4>

<p>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) may not be valid from 1 January 2021. Travellers should ensure they obtain insurance that covers their needs, particularly if they have a pre-existing medical condition.

<h2>What crew members need to know</h2>

<p>Crew members are subject to the same rules as passengers. This means that goods you are bringing in must be for your personal use, or to be given as a gift. Where Border Force are satisfied that you intend to sell the goods, they may be seized.
###What crew members need to know</p>

<p>There are changes to declaration rules for crew members who bring in goods for their personal use.</p>

<p>The personal allowance rules also apply to the following crew members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aircrew on international flights</li>
  <li>rail crew on board international rail journeys</li>
  <li>ferry crew on short sea international ferry services, and</li>
  <li>cruise crew on international cruise liner services</li>
</ul>

<p>These members of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/bring-personal-goods-into-uk">crew can make an online declaration</a> in the same way as passengers, using the online service. Members of crew with nothing to declare, or who have made an online declaration, may leave the airport, port or rail terminal via any route agreed locally with Border Force.</p>

<p>Members of crew who have not made an online declaration and have goods to declare, or have goods requiring a licence or commercial goods, must make a declaration at the first ‘red point’ or red channel they pass prior to exiting the airport, port or rail terminal, and must either exit via the red channel, or make their declaration at a place agreed locally in advance with Border Force.</p>

<h3>Personal allowance announcement scripts: entering Great Britain from 1 January 2021</h3>

<h4>Notes to announcers</h4>

<h4>Script for travellers from EU countries to Great Britain</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the rules have changed if you travel from an EU country to Great Britain – that is England, Scotland or Wales. You can no longer bring unlimited amounts of goods into Great Britain. Instead personal allowances apply to EU passengers.</p>

<p>Use <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s new online service to check if you owe tax or duty. You can pay online too before arrival into Great Britain, instead of using the red channel at UK Customs. 
To find out more go to GOV.UK and search ‘Bringing Goods into the UK’.</p>

<h4>Script for travellers from non-EU countries to Great Britain</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2021 some personal allowances have changed when bringing goods into Great Britain that is England, Scotland or Wales, from a non-EU country. You can now use <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s new online service to check if you need to pay tax and duty. You should pay online too, before arrival into Great Britain, instead of using the red channel at UK Customs where available.</p>

<p>To find out more go to GOV.UK and search ‘Bringing Goods into the UK’.</p>

<h4>Alcohol</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>42 litres of beer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>18 litres of still wine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 litres of spirit OR 9 litres of sparkling wine, fortified wine (e.g. sherry or port) or any alcoholic beverage of less than 22% <abbr title="Alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can split this last allowance. For example, if you bring in 4.5 litres of fortified wine (50% of your full allowance of 9 litres), then you may also bring in 2 litres of spirits (50% of your full allowance of 4 litres) to make up your 100% allowance in this category. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Tobacco</h4>

<ul>
  <li>200 cigarettes OR</li>
  <li>100 cigarillos OR</li>
  <li>50 cigars OR</li>
  <li>250g tobacco OR</li>
  <li>200 sticks of tobacco for heating</li>
</ul>

<p>You can combine the above allowances, provided that you do not exceed your total tobacco allowance. For example, if you only bring in 100 cigarettes (50% of your full allowance of 200), you may also bring in 25 cigars (50% of your full allowance of 50) to make up your 100% tobacco allowance. Please note, this is only an example and other combinations are also allowed.</p>

<h4>Any other goods</h4>
