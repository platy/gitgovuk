<p>This document provides details on the definitions used in Walking and Cycling statistics and describes the key data sources used to produce the walking and cycling statistics release.</p>
</div>

<h2>Data sources</h2>

<p>Walking and cycling statistics are estimated by looking at 2 main data sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the Active Lives survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> is a household survey designed to provide a rich source of data on personal travel. It is part of a continuous survey that began in July 1988, following ad hoc surveys since the mid-1960s. The survey is primarily designed to track long-term development of trends; therefore, care should be taken when drawing conclusions from short-term changes.</p>

<p>For more background on the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>, and information on how these statistics are produced please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics">statistical release</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021">background quality report</a>.</p>

<p>The Active Lives Survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>) is an annual household push-to-web survey administered by Sport England, an agency of the Department of Digital, Culture Media and Sport (DCMS). The first <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> was conducted between November 2015 and November 2016, and data is published biannually. The survey follows the Active People Survey (APS), which has been discontinued.</p>

<p>For more background on the <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>, and information on how these statistics are produced please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/know-your-audience/data/active-lives" rel="external">latest published reports</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research-and-data/data/active-lives/active-lives-data-tables#november202021-17274" rel="external">background quality report</a>.</p>

<p>Both surveys are based on a randomly selected sample of households. However, results from the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> are not directly comparable due to several methodological differences. Details of these differences are summarised in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/walking-and-cycling-statistics-notes-and-definitions">walking and cycling background quality report</a>.</p>

<p>Further details on differences between the different data sources for walking and cycling and their impact on trends can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/walking-and-cycling-statistics-england-2020">Impact of the pandemic on walking and cycling report</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>What data source should I use?</h3>

<p>It is recommended to use the NTS when looking at long term trends in walking and cycling as it includes a long, continuous series of data. The NTS should also be used for comparisons against other modes of transport, for example buses.</p>

<p>The ALS has a larger sample size and so is a better data source to use when looking at data at the local authority level. The NTS is only suitable for looking at data at the national and regional level.</p>
</div>

<h2>National Travel Survey</h2>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p>In years prior to 2020, <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> data has been collected via two main methods. Firstly, face to face interviews are carried out with all members of the household to collect personal and household characteristics, along with information on all of the vehicles to which they have access. Each household member is then asked to record details of all their trips over a seven-day period in a travel diary, allowing travel patterns to be linked with individual characteristics.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> data collection has been affected by varying restrictions associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Following a pause in fieldwork in March and April 2020, the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> has since relied upon data collection via ‘push-to-telephone’ with interviews being conducted over the telephone and interviewers completing the travel diary on behalf of respondents. During 2021, data collection was switched to mixed-mode, combining ‘push-to-telephone’ with ‘knock-to-nudge’. This approach has improved both the response rate and impact of non-response bias in 2021, compared to 2020, however the response rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. Only households classed as ‘fully co-operating’ are included in the response calculations. A national response rate of 38% was achieved in 2021. More details on the changes made to fieldwork operations in 2020 and 2021, and their impact on the data, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021">Technical Report</a>.</p>

<h3>Sample size</h3>

<p>During 2021, 4,429 households in England participated fully in the survey by providing information via interview and completing a seven-day travel diary. An additional 390 households participated in the interviews but did not all complete a diary. Although these cases cannot be used for trip-level analysis, their data is included in all analysis at household, individual and vehicle level.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Due to changes in the methodology of data collection, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 and 2021, as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting this data and comparing to other years, due to the small sample sizes. For further details, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2020">NTS background quality report</a>.</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>Diary sample</h3>

<p>Analysis of travel data for walking and cycling is primarily based on the diary sample. This comprises all ‘fully cooperating households’, defined as households for which the following information is available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a household interview (or telephone interview),</li>
  <li>an individual interview for each household member,</li>
  <li>a seven-day travel diary for each individual and,</li>
  <li>where applicable, at least one completed vehicle section.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weights were produced to adjust for non-response, and also for drop-of in recording observed during the seven-day travel week.</p>

<h2>Points of consideration: National Travel Survey</h2>

<h3>Cycling estimates</h3>

<p>Due to the low prevalence of cycling, the number of people in the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> sample that cycle is small. The figures provided on cycling should be interpreted with caution, especially when examining trends.</p>

<h3>Walking estimates</h3>

<p>Historically, in the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>, short walks (walks of more than 50 yards and less than 1 mile) were only recorded on the seventh day of the travel diary and weighted to account for underreporting. Since 2017, a methodological improvement was made to record short walks on day one of the diary for the whole sample. Figures for 2002 to 2015 have also been reweighted based on the new methodology.</p>

<p>More information on the weighting of short walks is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021"><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> Technical Report</a>.</p>

<h2><abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr></h2>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> is a mixed-mode (push-to-web) survey involving online (desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone) and paper methods for those households that either do not have internet access or prefer to complete the survey this way. Data collection is carried out by Ipsos MORI.</p>

<p>The survey:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes people aged 16 and over (14 and 15-year olds do sometimes take part but are excluded from the analysis).</li>
  <li>runs from mid-November to mid-November.</li>
  <li>interviews in each local authority are spread over the 12-month period to avoid seasonal bias.</li>
</ul>

<p>A letter is sent to a household – selected from the Royal Mail’s Postal Address File inviting up to 2 people per household to take part in the survey.</p>

<p>The overall sample size is around 175,000 people for each survey. For the majority of the local authorities, the target number of completed questionnaires is 500 returns, though some key areas will involve surveying a bigger number of people. For the 2 smallest local authorities (City of London and Isles of Scilly) the target was reduced to 250.</p>

<p>More detailed information about the data collection methodology can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research-and-data/data/active-lives?section=methodology" rel="external"><abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> methodology note</a>.</p>

<h3>Data weighting</h3>

<p>Weighting is required to reduce the bias in survey estimates. Data have been weighted to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland" rel="external">Office for National Statistics (ONS) population measures</a> for geography and key demographics. The sample sizes quoted in table CW0306 are weighted sample sizes.</p>

<h2>Points of consideration: <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>The Isles of Scilly and City of London</h3>

<p>The target sample sizes for the Isles and Scilly and the City of London are around 250. These are smaller than for other areas and therefore results for these areas may not be statistically robust, which is reflected in the wider confidence intervals given. The unusually small populations of Isles of Scilly and City of London also mean that they are not directly comparable with other authorities. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting the results for these 2 areas.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Cycling</strong></p>

<p><strong><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr></strong> - all cycles, including e-cycles, which take place on the public highway (any public road, street or path available to the public by a public right of way)</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr></strong> - cycle rides of any length for leisure, or for travel. Includes some recreational types of cycling such as mountain biking, track cycling, and cyclo-cross. Excludes exercise bikes and cycling indoors.</p>

<p><strong>Walking</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr></strong>: walks over 50 yards on the public highway</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr></strong>: any continuous walk of at least 10 minutes. Includes walking for leisure, for travel, rambling/Nordic walking. Excludes hiking, mountain/hill walking, and walking around shops.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disability</strong>:</p>

<p>In line with the Equalities Act 2010, the definition of disability a person in both sources is considered to have a disability if they report any physical or mental health condition or illness that lasts or is expected to last 12 months or more, and which limits their ability to carry out day-to-day activities</p>

<p><strong>Rural or Urban</strong></p>

<p>2011 Rural-Urban Classifications and an explanation of how they are defined is available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/2011-rural-urban-classifcation">DEFRA</a></p>

<h3>
<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> definitions</h3>

<p><strong>Trip</strong></p>

<p>A one-way course of travel with a single main purpose. A “cycling trip” is one where the greatest part was cycled.’ Note that outward and return trips are treated as two separate trips. Further, a trip can only have one purpose, and so a journey involving a mid-way change of purpose is split into two trips (except for minor secondary purposes, e.g. stopping to buy a newspaper).</p>

<p><strong>Stage</strong></p>

<p>Trips consist of one or more stages. A new stage is defined when there is a change in the mode of transport or when there is a change of vehicle requiring a separate ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Main mode of travel</strong></p>

<p>The main mode of a trip is that used for the longest stage of the trip by distance. With stages of equal length, the mode of the latest stage is used.</p>

<p><strong>Distance travelled</strong></p>

<p>This refers to the actual distance covered by a respondent rather than the distance ‘as the crow flies’.</p>

<p><strong>Short walk</strong></p>

<p>Walks longer than 50 yards (Around 46 metres or half a football field) but less than one mile. Short walks are recorded on first day of travel diary only (to reduce burden) and then multiplied by 7.</p>

<p>For more definitions used in the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021"><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> notes and definitions document</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> definitions</h3>

<p><strong>Area of residence</strong></p>

<p>Activities are grouped according to where respondents live, rather than where the activity took place. Accordingly, activities should be interpreted with caution (especially in large urban areas where local authorities cover a relatively small area) as these places may be different.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency of cycling and walking</strong></p>

<p>The number of days in the past 4 weeks (28 days) that a person performed a walking or cycling activity. Interpreted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least once per month = at least 1 out of 28 days</li>
  <li>at least once per week = at least 4 out of 28 days</li>
  <li>at least 3 times per week = at least 12 out of 28 days</li>
  <li>at least 5 times per week = at least 20 out of 28 days</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Purpose – leisure</strong></p>

<p>Walking or cycling for the purpose of recreation, health, competition, or training.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose – travel</strong></p>

<p>Walking or cycling to get to place-to-place, for example, commuting, visiting a friend, going to the supermarket.</p>

<p><strong>Time usually spent walking and cycling</strong></p>

<p>Time “usually” spent walking or cycling is the total time someone most frequently walks or cycles each day rather than the average time they spent walking or cycling across days.</p>
