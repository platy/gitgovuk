<p>The purpose of this document is to provide users of statistics with information on the quality of outputs in respect to different aspects of statistical quality. This report highlights some of the quality aspects of the NTS and ALS data used, such as response rates, and quality control measures. 
As a result, this document helps to demonstrate how the department complies with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>. These statistics are published as Official Statistics.</p>

<h2>About walking and cycling statistics</h2>

<p>Walking and cycling statistics are estimated by looking at 2 main data sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>the Active Lives survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together these statistics provide an annual snapshot of the journeys that are walked and cycled in England and the demographics of the people making those journeys.</p>

<p>For more background to these statistics, the surveys and information on how these statistics are produced please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021">national travel survey&nbsp;technical note</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research-and-data/data/active-lives#adultsurvey-17284" rel="external">active lives survey methodology page</a>.</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Relevance is the degree to which a statistical product meets user needs in terms of content and coverage.</p>
</div>

<p>The annual walking and cycling statistics include a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/walking-and-cycling-statistics">statistical release</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/walking-and-cycling-statistics-cw">data tables</a> that help provide estimates for the levels of walking and cycling across England and how this has changed over time.</p>

<h3>Known users and uses of the statistics</h3>

<p>Within the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, the statistics are used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for ministerial briefing and to answer public enquiries</li>
  <li>as background to inform policy development</li>
  <li>for monitoring key active travel commitments, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy-cwis2">Cycling and Walking investment strategy (<abbr title="Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy">CWIS</abbr>)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/904146/gear-change-a-bold-vision-for-cycling-and-walking.pdf" rel="external">Gear Change</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, known users include local authorities, researchers, academics and Parliamentary groups.</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>

<p>The walking and cycling statistical release is produced to high professional standards set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> was designated as National Statistics in July 2011; the continued designation was confirmed in September 2018. Results from <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> are published as Official Statistics. This means that both follow the practices set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<h2>Timeliness</h2>

<p>Walking and cycling statistics are published annually in-line with the publication of the National Travel Survey statistics. Both the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> are collected from surveys run throughout the year. The <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> data covers the period November to November and results are published by Sports England in April of the following year. The National Travel survey data is collected over the calendar year and published the following summer. The time between data collection and publication allows time for the data to be cleaned and validated, after which the data can be prepared, weighted and analysed to produce the final report.</p>

<p>In most recent years, the statistics for the previous year were published in the summer of the following year (for example, 2020 statistics were published in September 2021).</p>

<h2>Accuracy and reliability</h2>

<p>Both the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> are accurate datasets, produced to a high quality compliant with the code of practice for statistics. Both surveys involve detailed quality assurance processes throughout each production cycle and are conducted by established market research companies. Active Lives surveys are administered and managed by market research company IPSOS and the National Travel Survey is conducted by National Centre for Social Research.</p>

<p>Both datasets are designed to provide a representative sample of households in England.</p>

<p>For the <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>, the sample is selected at random using the Postcode Address File (PAF). This enables selection of a good spread of addresses across local authorities, and only up to two adults per household can complete. The survey uses a push-to-web methodology, so respondents without the internet can also complete via post. Through achieving around 180,000 completes, this enables collection of more accurate mean values (with larger sample sizes the identification of any outliers is easier, and their effect diminished). Larger sample sizes also result in smaller margins of error, as it is more likely the sample achieved will be representative of the population at large.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> is based on a stratified, clustered random sample of 12,852 private households. This sampling frame is also the Postcode Address File (PAF), which is a list of all addresses in England. Since 2014 interviewers have been assigned to start on different dates across the month to ensure that the interviewing and travel week start dates are evenly spread across the month. This reduces sample bias and means there is more data available for analysis on days of the month which were previously under-represented.</p>

<p>Although both surveys are reasonably comprehensive with high response rates, they can vary across the years which can impact the overall trends and make it difficult to compare trends over time.&nbsp;Where sample sizes are smaller for breakdowns, numbers may be suppressed, and care should be taken when interpreting trends.</p>

<h2>Strengths of the data</h2>

<p>The annual walking and cycling release is primarily informed by 2 data sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>National Travel Survey (conducted by the Department for Transport)</li>
  <li>Active Lives Survey (conducted by Sports England)</li>
</ul>

<p>The strengths and limitations of each data source will be outlined in turn.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021">National Travel Survey quality report</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research-and-data/data/active-lives/active-lives-data-tables#november202021-17274" rel="external">Active Lives Survey quality report</a>.</p>

<h3>National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><strong>Long-term and continuous</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> was first run in 1965 and has been running annually since 1988. Few changes to the methodology have been made (with the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> running in its exact configuration since a revamp of some questions and tables in 2002), enabling long-term trends to be identified and monitored.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed travel pattern data collected</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> collects data on who travelled, why, when, and how on a national level. This level of detail allows many useful insights to be made on walking and cycling patterns nationally, locally, and by settlement classification (e.g. rural versus urban areas).</p>

<p><strong>Large and representative sample</strong></p>

<p>The sample is carefully designed to represent England’s population, allowing data to be analysed according to demographics such as age, gender, region, and ethnic group. Whilst challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the size of the sample, on the whole the data remains largely representative.</p>

<p><strong>Modal comparison</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> travel diary collects data on trips by all modes of transport, allowing for the analysis of walking and cycling patterns compared to other modes of transport (for example, cars or buses). This is particularly useful for finding out how England is performing in terms of key policy objectives, for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy-cwis2">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/904146/gear-change-a-bold-vision-for-cycling-and-walking.pdf" rel="external">Gear Change</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong></p>

<p>As a household survey with a randomly stratified sample, every address in England has a known and calculable chance of being invited to participate in the survey.</p>

<p><strong>Open data</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> dataset is freely accessible from the UK Data Service for users who wish to explore micro-level data for themselves.</p>

<h3>Active Lives Survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><strong>Large representative sample</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> is a survey of around 180,000 adults across England and results are weighted to ensure they are representative of the population. The sample aims to achieve a minimum of 500 responses per local authority, with boosted samples in some years for priority areas). This large sample allows detailed analysis, including at the Local authority level.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong></p>

<p>As a household survey with a randomly stratified sample, every address in England has a known and calculable chance of being invited to participate in the survey.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous data collection</strong></p>

<p>The Active Lives Survey was started in 2015 and has continued to be collected each year using consistent methodology, this means that we can start to look at longer-term trends in activity and sports participation habits.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<h3>National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><strong>Lower-level geographies:</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> is not designed to produce robust data below regional level. Whilst it is possible to analyse data for smaller geographies than regions, for example local authorities, often many years of data need to be combined to obtain a suitable sample size. Analyses of lower level geographies may also be skewed as the sample is weighted to be representative of England, not local areas.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulties performing multiple demographic breakdowns</strong></p>

<p>Also related to sample size, it is also difficult to obtain a large enough sample size to produce robust analysis for specific groups which require multiple demographic breakdowns, for example commuting walking trips in North East England by women aged 60+. This is particularly pronounced with cycling data as only a small number of people in England cycle and a small number of journeys are cycled.</p>

<p><strong>Self-reported data</strong></p>

<p>As with any data reliant on people recording it themselves, there is always room for errors such as inaccurate recall, forgetting to record journeys at all, and wrong estimation of the time or distance of a journey. Validation checks are in place to minimise errors.</p>

<h3>Active Lives Survey (<abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><strong>No modal comparisons</strong></p>

<p>The Active Lives survey is collected by Sports England to monitor activity levels throughout England. As such, it has a focus on physical activity and does not contain data on other modes of transport, such as car and bus to allow comparisons.</p>

<p><strong>Self-reported data</strong></p>

<p>As with any data reliant on people recording it themselves, there is always room for errors such as inaccurate recall, forgetting to record journeys at all, and wrong estimation frequency or duration of an activity. Validation checks are in place to minimise errors.</p>

<h2>Comparability and coherence</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Comparability is the degree to which data can be compared over time and domain. Coherence is the degree to which data that are derived from different sources or methods, but refer to the same topic, are similar.</p>
</div>

<p>Both surveys are based on a randomly selected sample of households. However, results from the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> are not directly comparable due to several methodological differences as demonstrated in Table 1.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> should be used when looking at longer term trends of data, comparisons against other modes of transport and considering progress against government aims such the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy-cwis2">cycling and walking investment strategy</a>. The <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> should be used when considering analysis of lower level geographies, such as local authority level, due to its larger sample size.</p>

<p>Further details on the comparability of the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> as well as other data sources can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/walking-and-cycling-statistics-england-2020">Impact of the pandemic on walking and cycling report</a>.</p>

<p>Sport England publish their own results from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportengland.org/research/active-lives-survey/" rel="external"><abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr></a> each year in April.</p>

<h3>Intensity</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> includes questions about the pace of walking and cycling, and the effort that was put into these activities (for example, whether it was enough to make the respondent out of breath). Sport England’s measure of activity uses this data to only include physical activity that is intense enough to contribute to the respondent’s health. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> walking and cycling estimates do not use the intensity information, which generally makes the proportion of adults walking and cycling slightly different to <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> figures.</p>

<h3>Exercise bikes</h3>

<p>Sport England use a broader term “Cycling for leisure and sport”, which is similar to <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s “cycling for leisure”, but includes the use of exercise bikes, for example cycling on a machine indoors. Whilst this definition works for measuring physical activity, the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> estimates do not include this activity.</p>

<p>There are also other sources that give an indication of cycling levels in England, including:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Clarity</h3>

<p>The statistical releases use plain language, in which technical terms, acronyms and definitions are defined where appropriate. The main findings are presented using a series of text and charts. Full details of the strengths and weaknesses of the data, as well as full definitions are provided in the release, quality report and notes and definitions document.</p>

<h2>Impact of COVID-19</h2>

<p>Various levels of national and local ‘lockdowns’, as well as personal restrictions, were in place during 2020 and 2021, affecting large portions of the population. Following the on-set of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the government introduced public health measures which restricted non-essential travel and in-person contact. This had a significant impact on the travel behaviours of people in England, with the advice to avoid public transport even when some early restrictions were lifted. People were encouraged to walk and cycle throughout the pandemic. More details about the coronavirus restrictions can be found in the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/charts/uk-government-coronavirus-lockdowns" rel="external">timeline of UK government coronavirus lockdowns</a>.</p>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p>Since March 2020, <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> data collection has been affected by varying restrictions associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Following a pause in fieldwork in March and April 2020, the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> has since relied upon data collection via ‘push-to-telephone’ with interviews being conducted over the telephone and interviewers completing the travel diary on behalf of respondents. During 2021, data collection was switched to mixed-mode, combining ‘push-to-telephone’ with ‘knock-to-nudge’.</p>

<p>This approach has improved both the response rate and impact of non-response bias in 2021, compared to 2020, however the response rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. More details on the changes made to fieldwork operations in 2020 and 2021, and their impact on the data, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2021">Technical Report</a>.</p>

<p>Due to changes in the methodology of data collection of the National Travel Survey during 2020 and 2021, changes in travel behaviour and a reduction of data collected during 2020 as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, care should be taken when interpreting the data and comparing to other years, due to the smaller sample sizes. Whilst the <abbr title="Active Lives Survey">ALS</abbr> data collected was not impacted by a reduction in sample size during 2020, care should still be taken to consider the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the trends seen.</p>

<h3>School closures</h3>

<p>Data on travel to school is impacted by changes in travel behaviour as well as school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. Data for 2020 and 2021, as well as changes from previous years should be interpreted accordingly.  More details about the coronavirus restrictions can be found in the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/charts/uk-government-coronavirus-lockdowns" rel="external">timeline of UK government coronavirus lockdowns</a>.</p>
