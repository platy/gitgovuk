<p>From: Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</p>

<p>To: Amanda Pritchard, NHS Chief Executive</p>

<p>8 January 2022</p>

<p>Dear Amanda,</p>

<p>Thank you for your letter of 7 January 2022, relating to increasing the use of available
capacity in the independent sector to help maintain NHS services. I have considered the
contents of your letter carefully.</p>

<p>I recognise the Managing Public Money issues that these arrangements cause for you as
the Accounting Officer. However, as we continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, in
particular the emergence of the Omicron variant, I believe the need to protect NHS services
and prevent a further reduction in NHS capacity are compelling reasons to justify their
introduction. The government is fully committed to ensuring the NHS has access to all the
resources it may need to respond to the ongoing wave of infections caused by this new
variant.</p>

<p>I am directing you as Accounting Officer that you may take forward this scheme with
immediate effect, managing the identified risks as best you can.</p>

<p>I want to make clear my gratitude for the incredible efforts NHS staff have made throughout
the pandemic, and that I know continue to be made.</p>

<p>In line with the usual process for ministerial directions, I am also copying this letter to the
Cabinet Secretary, the Comptroller and Auditor General (who will inform the Public
Accounts Committee) and to the Treasury Officer of Accounts.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p>Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP</p>
