<p>2 February 2021</p>

<p>Dear Nicola,</p>

<p>Our joint mission to vaccinate the people of the United Kingdom is the most important
peacetime endeavour this country has ever undertaken.</p>

<p>Protecting the public from COVID-19 offers our best hope of defeating the pandemic
and returning to normal life.</p>

<p>After so much pain and loss, and after so many months of difficult restrictions, nothing
matters more.</p>

<p>It is essential that all parts of the UK fight the pandemic together so we are able to
ease restrictions and exit lockdown together.</p>

<p>As we have agreed previously, there are significant advantages to moving in lockstep
on major decisions.</p>

<p>It means we can communicate more clearly and present consistent messages on
travel between the UK and our friends and partners overseas.</p>

<p>With Scotland at the heart of our integrated UK internal market, it is also essential for
our economic recovery as we strive to protect not just lives but also livelihoods.</p>

<p>I am writing today to restate the UK Government’s full support in rolling out the
vaccination programme and fighting the pandemic across the whole country.</p>

<p>I’m sure you would agree with me that it is in everyone’s interests that progress in
vaccinating the people of Scotland matches the best efforts of the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we stand ready to offer any support or assistance we can give you
to accelerate your rollout programme.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, has underlined our
open offer of mutual aid between health services around the UK.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben Wallace, the Secretary of State for Defence, has been clear the
Ministry of Defence stands ready to work with the Scottish Government on further
requests for military assistance.</p>

<p>In the course of the past year, we have learned how working together as one UK is
the most effective way to fight COVID-19.</p>

<p>The UK Government has invested more than £300 million in developing vaccines and
we have secured 400 million doses. It is thanks to this striking UK effort we can now
see light at the end of a very dark tunnel.</p>

<p>The UK Government has established more than 50 walk-through and mobile testing
centres across Scotland.</p>

<p>The Glasgow Lighthouse Lab analyses tests conducted in Scotland and other parts of
the UK, around the clock.</p>

<p>The British Military has played a key role setting up testing sites and, in recent weeks,
has begun a new programme to create 80 vaccination centres across Scotland.</p>

<p>We are in the process of bringing more military personnel into the vaccination
programme.</p>

<p>Our health services have also pulled together, with ambulance services in Scotland
and England joining forces to ensure calls are answered without delay.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that to put the nightmare of COVID-19 behind us as quickly as
possible, we must collaborate as closely as possible.</p>

<p>THE RT HON. ALISTER JACK MP
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND</p>
