<p>This guidance should be read before making any application to register a boat on Environment Agency waterways.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Boat name and registration number</h2>

<p>We keep registration data (including boat names) for 7 years in line with our data retention policy in the privacy notice. This means a boat name will become available to others if not used for 7 years.</p>

<p>Boat names must be unique for registration purposes on the Thames and Upper Medway.</p>

<p>It is acceptable for owners of narrowboats to display the boat name in the traditional way on each side of the cabin.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Registered owner</h2>

<p>Only one person or organisation may be registered as the owner.</p>

<p>Please note, if you sell your boat, it is your responsibility to notify us of the change of ownership in writing. You must complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-waterways-change-of-ownership-or-address-form">change of ownership form</a>. Until you do so, you remain the legal owner of the boat and are therefore responsible for it. This means you are still responsible for registering it and paying any charges due.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Usual mooring or location of boat</h2>

<p>This is the permanent mooring or storage location of your boat.</p>

<p>For a boat with both summer and winter berths, please enter summer berth only.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Boat details</h2>

<p>Please give length and beam measurements in metres and tenths.</p>

<p>‘Length’ is overall hull length excluding moveable items such as rudder or outboard engine. 
‘Beam’ is measured at the widest part of the hull.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Sanitary facilities</h2>

<p>We expect boats with sanitary facilities to have a suitable means of sewage disposal; not a direct discharge into the river. It is a criminal offence to put into the water any liquid or solid matter that is poisonous or injurious to fish, spawning ground or food of fish.</p>

<p>River Thames - Boats fitted with a lavatory or sanitary holding tank capable of discharge to the river must have these appliances sealed to prevent discharge whilst on the Thames. Owners of boats fitted with such appliances are legally obliged to inform the Lock Keeper at the lock nearest to the boat’s point of entry to the river in order that arrangements for sealing can be made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Propulsion</h2>

<p>Where the main engine(s) is of the outdrive/sterndrive type, tick the ‘inboard’ box.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Construction and equipment standards</h2>

<p>You must make sure your powered boat complies with our construction and equipment standards at all times it is kept or used on Environment Agency waterways.</p>

<p>We may refuse to issue a registration or suspend a current registration if we find a boat does not comply with these standards at any time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) Declaration of Conformity</h3>

<p>We will accept a valid RCD Declaration of Conformity made by the boat’s builder instead of BSS Certification for the first four years from new. This is because CE marked craft conforming to the Essential Requirements of the RCD should also comply with the construction and equipment safety standards of the Boat Safety Scheme.</p>

<p>RCD Declarations of Conformity are valid for a maximum of four years from the date of issue, but all boat owners are responsible for making sure their boat complies with safety standards at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Boat Safety Scheme (BSS) Certification - Private</h3>

<p>These standards are set out in the BSS Examination Checking Procedures for Privately Owned and Managed Boats.</p>

<p>All boats carrying fuel or fitted with domestic cooking, heating, refrigerating or lighting appliances must have BSS Certification with the exception of boats covered by a Recreational Craft Directive Declaration of Conformity and privately owned unpowered open boats.</p>

<p>BSS Certification is not required for a privately owned outboard engine, open boats providing it is not carrying or fitted with domestic cooking, heating, refrigerating or lighting appliances, other permanent electrical systems and it is propelled solely by an outboard engine without a fixed fuel system. This type of boat must still comply with the relevant BSS requirements of the BSS Examination Checking Procedures for Privately Owned and Managed Boats parts 3, 4, 5 and 6 as appropriate. We strongly recommend fire extinguishers are also carried.</p>

<p>BSS certification are valid for a maximum of four years from the date of issue, but all boat owners are responsible for making sure their boat complies with safety standards at all times. The Boat Safety Scheme requirements and lists of authorised Boat Safety Scheme examiners are available from:</p>

<p>Call 0333 202 1000 or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.boatsafetyscheme.org">Boat Safety Scheme website</a>.</p>

<p>Note: A boat which has any form of enclosed accommodation or which is decked‐over the greater part of the hull is not regarded as an open boat for the purposes of these requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Boat Safety Scheme (BSS) Certification – Non-Private</h3>

<p>For other non‐private boats, these standards are contained in the Boat Safety Scheme Guide (2002 edition). Examples of these boats are;</p>

<ul>
  <li>small passenger boats</li>
  <li>shared‐ownership boats managed jointly by the private owners</li>
  <li>workboats</li>
  <li>emergency service boats and rescue boats</li>
  <li>club/society/not-for-profit organisation/charity activity boats</li>
  <li>hotel boats, boats let as residences or longer term accommodation, for example advertising a cabin aboard, or even the whole boat, as rentable accommodation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Insurance - private powered boats and unpowered enclosed boats</h2>

<p>You must have in force an insurance policy for the boat, provided by a company that is authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority, which covers third‐party liabilities of at least one million pounds. We do not need a copy of the insurance certificate but we carry out sample checks on declarations.</p>

<p>We recommend all unpowered open boat owners have insurance which covers third‐party liabilities of at least one million pounds. We do not need to see a copy of the insurance certificate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Public liability insurance - not for profit organisations or charities only</h2>

<p>Operators of all not-for-profit organisation or charity boats must hold a valid public liability insurance policy covering liabilities of at least two million pounds for each claim. You will need to provide details of your public liability insurance on the form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Business boats: additional requirements</h2>

<p>Operators of business boats will need to meet additional requirements in order to register the business boat with the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>The requirements you need to meet are shown next to the business category(s).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span>Anglian Pass</h3>

<p>The Anglian Pass is a joint arrangement between the Environment Agency, the Conservators of the River Cam and the Middle Level Commissioners to allow powered boaters, annual unrestricted access across the three authorities’ navigations.</p>

<p>You will require a valid annual boat registration when applying for the Pass. For the Environment Agency, you will require an annual powered boat registration that covers the Great Ouse system and River Nene.</p>

<p>The Pass is a fixed price, based on boat length, for the year starting 1 April and ending the following 31 March. The Pass can be purchased at any point during the year, but there are no reductions in the cost if obtained part way through the year. However, boaters still have the option of purchasing short-term/visitor registrations/licences, from the respective navigation authorities, if they so choose.</p>
