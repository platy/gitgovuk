<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Eligibility to claim</h2>

<p>The following providers are eligible to make claims using the online form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>state-funded schools</li>
  <li>further education, sixth form and tertiary colleges</li>
  <li>independent training providers</li>
  <li>apprenticeship training providers</li>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>When to claim</h2>

<p>Claims should be submitted after all costs have been incurred. Cancellation charges are ineligible unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated. For example, where local restrictions prevent candidates from taking exams at a venue where payment has already been made and cannot be refunded, but not in circumstances such as the centre deciding to hold exams on its own premises.</p>

<p>The deadlines for submitting claims are outlined below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Claim type</th>
      <th scope="col">Deadline</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Private candidates</td>
      <td>10 January 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Priority appeals</td>
      <td>10 January 2022</td>
    </tr>

      <td>6 April 2022</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Claims can be amended or deleted up until the deadlines by state funded schools, further education, sixth form and tertiary colleges only. It will not be possible to grant any extensions to the deadlines.</p>

<p>For any amendments submitted after a deadline or for private centres, you need to complete an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a> with the details.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Accessing the claim form</h2>

<p>Select <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/exam-funding">the link to the claim form</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Before you start</h3>

<p>Before you start the claims process, please ensure that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance on how to make a claim</li>
  <li>have a <a href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">UKPRN number</a> and a <a rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">DfE sign-in account</a> (as appropriate)</li>
  <li>are an <a class="govuk-link" href="#Introduction">eligible establishment</a>
</li>
  <li>have your vocational and technical or functional skills <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfe-exam-support-service-claiming-costs">qualification numbers</a>
</li>
  <li>have registered your <a href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/provide_information_about_your_banking_and_payments_to_DfE" class="govuk-link" rel="external">bank details with DfE</a> at least 15 working days before the claim form closes if you do not already receive your funding through ESFA</li>
  <li>have completed the spreadsheet templates to upload for private candidates or priority appeal claims - the templates can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfe-exam-support-service-claiming-costs" class="govuk-link">GOV.UK coronavirus (COVID-19) qualifications funding page</a>
</li>
  <li>have evidence of your costs available to upload for autumn 2021 exam series, and private candidate appeals costs charged by awarding organisations if applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>Select <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/exam-funding" rel="external">the link to the claim form</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have moved on from the initial page by selecting âstart nowâ you will then be asked to select your organisation. Please select the type that best describes your organisation.</p>

<p>To access the claim form, you will need to enter your 8-digit UK provider registration number (UKPRN).</p>

<h4>If you do not have a UKPRN</h4>

<p>If you do not know the UKPRN for your school or college, you can find it on the <a rel="external" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">get information about schools</a> database on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>If you do not have a UKPRN, you can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/ukrlp/ukrlp_registration.page_pls_regProviderStep1">register as a UK learning provider</a>. If your school or college is not already set up with a <a href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">DfE sign-in</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukrlp.co.uk/" class="govuk-link">UKPRN</a>, you should set this up in advance of making a claim, so that payment is not delayed.</p>

<h4>For state funded schools, further education, sixth form and tertiary colleges you will then log in to your DfE Sign-in account</h4>

<p><strong>1</strong>)	When prompted, enter your <a rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">DfE Sign-in</a> credentials (this is just for authentication).</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>)	Choose the organisation for whom you are completing the form.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>)	The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you logged in. This will show the name, address and Unique Reference Number (URN) or UKPRN of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who logged into DfE Sign-in.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong>)	If these details are correct, then all you need do is to select âContinueâ to step to the next page.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>)	If you believe they are incorrect, complete the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form">ESFA online enquiries</a> form and we will investigate.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong>)	Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</p>

<p><strong>7</strong>)	To access the form for another organisation, sign out and follow steps 1 to 4 again.</p>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation you are completing the claim form for. You do not need to add any services in DfE Sign-in, it is only used for authentication purposes.</p>

<h4>If you are a state-funded school or a further education, sixth-form or tertiary college and do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h4>

<p>You will need to create one.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>)	Select the âcreate accountâ button from the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/">DfE Sign-in page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>)	Enter your name and email address (it is best to use your work email address or one that is clearly associated with your organisation).</p>

<p><strong>3</strong>)	We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong>)	Create a memorable password of 12 characters or more (we recommend joining 3 or more familiar words).</p>

<p><strong>5</strong>)	Sign in using your new credentials, and request access to the organisation for which you would like to submit a claim.</p>

<p>Once your request to access an organisation has been approved, you can follow the steps outlined under <a class="govuk-link" href="#log%20in%20to%20your%20DfE%20Sign-in%20account">already have a DfE account</a> to complete the form.</p>

<p>You might have noticed the term âapproverâ during account creation. An approver is someone at your organisation responsible for controlling who has access to DfE Sign-in and the services within the system. It is usually a senior person, such as an administrator or manager.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisationâs approvers before you can access the form.</p>

<h4>If you need further assistance</h4>

<p>If you are having problems using the DfE Sign-in service, follow <a rel="external" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact" class="govuk-link">DfE Sign-in Help</a>. You will be able to request further assistance if required. When raising a support request, please select âotherâ.</p>

<p>If you believe you are eligible to claim but have problems accessing the form, please <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form">get in touch with us</a>, selecting the âDfE exam support serviceâ button.</p>

<h4>For all other organisation types</h4>

<ul>
  <li>You will be asked to confirm your UKPRN and then âsearch for organisationâ</li>
  <li>Confirmation of your organisation name and UKPRN will be presented</li>
  <li>If your UKPRN is not found, please either <a href="#If-you-do-not-have-a-UKPRN" class="govuk-link">register for a UKPRN</a> or if you think there is a problem <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">contact us</a>, selecting the DfE exam support service button.</li>
  <li>You will then be asked if you have a vendor number (a letter followed by 7-digit number)</li>
  <li>If you do not, select âNoâ and you will receive a notice that advises you that you can still proceed with your claim, but that you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/provide_information_about_your_banking_and_payments_to_DfE" rel="external">register your bank details</a> in order to receive your claims payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will then be asked to enter your name and contact details including contact telephone number and email address.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Autumn 2021 exam types</h3>

<p>Select the exam type for Autumn 2021 that you wish to claim funding for.</p>

<h4>Autumn 2021: VTQs &amp; FSQs</h4>

<p>You will only see this page if you have selected VTQs and FSQs at the autumn 2021 exam type page.</p>

<p>This section will give you a brief introduction of vocational and technical qualifications (VTQs), functional skill qualifications (FTQs) and other general qualifications. You need the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfe-exam-support-service-claiming-costs" class="govuk-link">qualification number</a> of any VTQ or FSQs exams to check that they are in scope for funding.</p>

<p>How many VTQ or FSQ Exams were held?</p>

<p>You can select between 1 and 20 exams from the drop-down and can also select qualification number from the drop-down list.  You must input qualification number for the exam to proceed with claim form.</p>

<h4>Autumn 2021: Exam fees</h4>

<p>This section gives you a brief introduction of exam fees and explains eligible and ineligible costs.</p>

<p>If you select âyesâ as an answer to claim for exam fees, you will be asked to provide information regarding rebates for 2021 exam series, total number of eligible exam entries and total value of all eligible exam entries for October 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<p>We will only fund autumn exams fee amounts which exceed any rebates or credit notes you receive for summer 2021. Additionally, for VTQs, you should only claim for funding for costs which exceed your usual autumn/spring exam costs (and which are not covered by any 2021 rebates you receive).</p>

<h5>Eligibility</h5>

<p>Subject to verification of the evidence provided, you are eligible to claim â[total value of all eligible exam entries] â [rebates]â You will only be asked to provide a statement if you have selected âyesâ to previous question.</p>

<h4>Autumn 2021: invigilation costs</h4>

<p>You can claim back the deficit of invigilation costs for the period October 2021 to March 2022 (plus any costs you paid for invigilation over summer 2021) that exceed your usual invigilation costs (likely for the academic year 2018 to 2019).</p>

<p>These should not include training courses as these can be claimed for separately (see invigilator training costs). Costs can include time invigilators spend receiving training on venue-specific information.</p>

<p>If you select âyesâ as an answer to claim for invigilation costs, you will be asked about your total invigilation costs from a previous year (likely to be for year 2018 to 2019) and a breakdown of invigilation payments for this year.</p>

<p>You should enter all payments excluding VAT, unless you are unable to reclaim through other means.  If your claim includes VAT, you will be asked to make an additional declaration before submitting this claim.</p>

<h5>Eligibility</h5>

<p>Subject to verification of the evidence provided you are eligible to claim â[total invigilation costs for the period October 2021 to March 2022] + [ Total invigilation costs for summer 2021] - [Total costs for invigilation in typical year]â. You will only be asked to provide a statement if you have selected âyesâ to previous question.</p>

<h4>Autumn 2021: Invigilator training costs</h4>

<p>This funding is available to provide financial support to schools and colleges to train new invigilators to support the delivery of exams of the autumn 2021 exam series.</p>

<p>If you select âyesâ as an answer to claim for the costs, you will be asked about total invigilation training costs from October 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<p>You should enter all payments excluding VAT, unless you are unable to reclaim through other means.  If your claim includes VAT, you would be asked to make an additional declaration before submitting this claim.</p>

<h4>Autumn 2021: Venue costs</h4>

<p>This funding is available to provide financial support to schools and colleges to find alternative sites to run the autumn exams where it is not possible to run them on their own sites (or collaboratively) without disruption to study.</p>

<p>If you select âyesâ as an answer to claim for venue costs, you will be asked about number of venues used that incurred a cost including venue name, postcode, largest number of candidates and number of days venue used, with the dates they were used on.</p>

<p>You need to enter total cost of all venues that you wish to claim.  You should enter all payments excluding VAT unless you are unable to reclaim through other means.</p>

<p>If your claim includes VAT, you would be asked to make an additional declaration before submitting this claim.</p>

<h4>Supportive evidence</h4>

<p>You can upload up to 4 files to support your claim.  If you need to provide additional evidence, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfe-exam-support-service-claiming-costs">user guidance</a>.</p>
