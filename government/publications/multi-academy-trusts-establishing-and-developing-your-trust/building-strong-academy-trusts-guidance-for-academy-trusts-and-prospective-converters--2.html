<h2>Growing existing academy trusts</h2>

<p>Talk to your RSC office about the possibility of growth. They will want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be sure that you are able to meet the needs of the schools currently within your academy trust</li>
  <li>understand your motivations for growth</li>
</ul>

<p>The ESFA can provide advice on your financial plans, to ensure that growth will not impact upon longer-term financial sustainability.</p>

<h3>Due diligence</h3>

<p>Academy trusts must strike a balance between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting additional schools</li>
  <li>maintaining standards at the schools they already manage</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering whether to grow, an academy trust will need to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the geographical fit of schools</li>
  <li>the educational, financial and capital risks</li>
</ul>

<p>The process of considering these factors is often referred to as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/due-diligence-in-academies-and-maintained-schools">due diligence</a>.</p>

<p>The growth of church academy trusts will be in accordance with the wider diocesan strategy. Academy trusts and dioceses must work closely with their RSC office when considering growth.</p>

<p>The decision about whether a school joins your academy trust should be taken by both the governing body of the school and your academy trust board before being taken to the RSC for a final decision.</p>

<p>To support academy trusts to grow, the Trust Capacity Fund 2021-22 , was announced in April 2021.</p>

<h3>Sponsoring a school</h3>

<p>You may be approached by your RSC team to consider <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sponsor-an-academy">sponsoring a vulnerable school</a> with an Academy Order. If a non-diocesan school has been served with an Academy Order it means that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school must join an academy trust for urgent and sustainable improvement</li>
  <li>decision about which sponsoring academy trust the school will join lies with the RSC, although they will take the school’s views into consideration</li>
  <li>transfer should take no more than 9 months</li>
</ul>

<p>If a church school has an Academy Order, conversations will place between the RSC and the diocese as per the MOUs between the churches and the department.</p>

<p>RSCs will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sponsor-an-academy">assess you as a sponsor</a> and look at your academy trust’s track record of driving improvement. The assessment can take place at the same time as the decision about the school with the Academy Order joining your academy trust.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider both the short and long-term needs of the school</li>
  <li>work with the local authority and RSC on any immediate short-term support for the school</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the decision is made about which academy trust will sponsor the school, the academy trust can become more involved in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>direct improvement work</li>
  <li>finance and governance support</li>
  <li>decisions about staffing</li>
</ul>

<p>There are funded tariffs to support schools with an Academy Order once they have joined an academy trust which your RSC will talk to you about.</p>

<h3>Converting a school</h3>

<p>Non-diocesan academy trusts that have capacity to grow should be active in engaging schools in their local area that may be interested in conversion.</p>

<p>Trust Partnerships  is a sector-led initiative which allows schools to collaborate with academy trusts in order to decide whether conversion is right for them.</p>

<p>Before voluntary conversion, both parties should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the short and long-term needs of the school and academy trust</li>
  <li>the opportunities that growth presents</li>
  <li>what capacity you will need to support schools joining</li>
  <li>what the school(s) bring or what they need from the academy trust</li>
  <li>how the academy trust board or leadership may need to adjust once the school is in the academy trust</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Education_and_Skills_Funding_Agency__ESFA__enquiry_form" rel="external">Contact your RSC’s office or the ESFA</a> for further discussions about growth and planning.</p>

<h3>Academy trust transfers and mergers</h3>

<p>MATs can grow by consolidating with other academy trusts.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Case study: consolidating with another academy trust</h4>

<p>In 2020 Anglian Learning merged with Chilford Hundred Education Trust (CHET) – a multi academy trust operating four primaries and one secondary in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<h5>Before merger</h5>

<p>In 2018 CHET talked to several academy trusts about a possible merger and identified Anglian Learning as an academy trust that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shared similar aims and values</li>
  <li>had the capacity to develop school improvement and effective leadership across its academies</li>
</ul>

<p>CHET and Anglian Learning worked together over 12 months to make sure that the merger was the right option for both trusts. They collaborated on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leadership meetings</li>
  <li>joint trust inset days</li>
  <li>community engagement</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach helped to develop a clear understanding of what a merger would mean for the trusts, their academies and their communities.</p>

<h5>The benefits of merger</h5>

<p>Anglian and CHET’s approach to merger resulted in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>successful working partnerships</li>
  <li>a stronger single academy trust structure</li>
  <li>greater long-term benefits for the academies and their communities</li>
</ul>

<p>Anglian Learning is now a multi-academy trust of 14 academies working across both primary and secondary sectors.</p>
</div>

<p>Small academy trusts can choose to merge together to form a bigger trust which can have a greater impact across the area.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Case study: merging to form a bigger academy trust</h4>

<p>Westcountry Schools Trust (WeST) in the South West became a MAT in 2010. On 1 September 2019, WeST welcomed all 5 academies in the Plym Academy Trust as part of a strategic voluntary merger process. The benefits to merging both trusts included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased opportunities for pupils and staff</li>
  <li>a greater depth of school improvement capacity</li>
  <li>a more robust, single operating structure</li>
</ul>

<h5>Leadership</h5>

<p>Plym Academy Trust’s CEO was appointed as WeST’s Director of Primary School Improvement. This role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>created significant school improvement capacity within WeST</li>
  <li>retained the expertise of a skilled CEO</li>
</ul>

<p>In early 2019, the regional schools commissioner (RSC) for the South-West:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approved Plym Academy Trust’s merger with WeST</li>
  <li>worked closely with both academy trusts to deliver the merger</li>
  <li>ensured the academies were part of the same trust structure in time for the start of the 2019/20 academic year</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of WeST, the 5 academies previously in Plym Academy Trust remain Ofsted rated Good or Outstanding. WeST now has 22 schools across the South-West.</p>
</div>

<p>Most academy trust transfers or mergers, involve the academies from one academy trust legally joining another, rather than establishing a new legal body with associated costs.</p>

<p>A new legal body is usually established when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a standalone academy trust transfers into a larger MAT</li>
  <li>a smaller academy trust or academy trust with vulnerable schools joins a stronger academy trust</li>
  <li>two academy trusts of equal size or capacity want more of an equal merger</li>
</ul>

<p>A new legal body may involve consultations on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vision</li>
  <li>name change</li>
  <li>changes to the academy trustees and leadership structures</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Case study - a new ethos to support merger</h4>

<p>Epworth Education Trust became a multi-academy trust with a Methodist designation in 2020 after the voluntary merger of 2 smaller multi-academy trusts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wesley Methodist Trust</li>
  <li>Acorn Trust</li>
</ul>

<h5>Before merger</h5>

<p>In 2018 Wesley and Acorn’s CEOs began informal discussions about merger. They set up a working party of staff and trustees from both trusts to explore the challenges and opportunity a merger would present. Both trusts prioritised the importance of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the alignment of vision and values</li>
  <li>central trust functions</li>
  <li>governance structures</li>
  <li>championing the Methodist designation across the trusts</li>
</ul>

<h5>A new ethos and governance model</h5>

<p>The trusts agreed that a Methodist designation would underpin Epworth’s ethos and become a part of the master funding agreement and Articles of Association. The trust’s core principles centre on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Methodist values and the ethos of ‘where the need is most’</li>
  <li>supporting local communities</li>
  <li>high-quality professional development</li>
  <li>a dynamic, creative curriculum for its pupils</li>
</ul>

<p>Epworth Education Trust now operates 5 Ofsted rated Good and Outstanding primary academies across the North-West. It sponsored the sixth school into its academy trust on 1 December 2020.</p>
