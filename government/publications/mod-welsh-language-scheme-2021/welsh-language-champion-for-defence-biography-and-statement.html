<p>Air Commodore Adrian Williams was born in St Asaph, Denbighshire. He was brought up in the town of Denbigh and attended Ysgol Uwchradd Glan Clwyd, St Asaph and was also a member of Number 1286 Squadron Air Training Corps, Denbigh. Subsequently, he attended the University College of North Wales, Bangor.</p>

<p>He joined the Royal Air Force in December 1980 as a Logistics Officer and has held a range of appointments over many years of service, both within the United Kingdom and overseas. This includes a very enjoyable tour between 1988-90 as Officer Commanding Supply and Movements at RAF Brawdy in Pembrokeshire.  Other postings have included tours at RAF fast jet bases in Germany during the Cold War, within the Ministry of Defence in London, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Air Power Centre in Kalkar, Germany, and a posting with the UK Defence Equipment and Support Organisation, developing logistics and Information Technology procedures and equipment to support our Armed Forces on operations.</p>

<p>In 2009, Air Commodore Williams left the regular RAF to become the Director of Planning and Resources for the Countryside Council for Wales. In August 2014, he was appointed as the Director of Resources for Dyfed Powys Police. Throughout this period to date, Air Commodore Williams has been a RAF Reserve, continuing to serve in the role of Air Officer for Wales, which is the senior RAF Officer in Wales, and in which he is also Aide de Camp to Her Majesty The Queen.</p>

<p>Air Commodore Williams is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport and also has an MA in Defence Studies from King’s College London.  He is married to Sulwen, both of whom are Welsh speakers. They have two grown up daughters; Catrin and Lowri. Air Commodore Williams is a keen sportsman and in recent years he has become increasingly active in studying and researching the history of the RAF in Wales, together with the stories of the many Welsh people who have served in the RAF over the last 100+ years.</p>

<h2>Air Commodore Adrian Williams’ statement</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is a great privilege to be appointed MOD’s Welsh Language Champion. As someone who was brought up in a Welsh speaking household, and who went to a Welsh speaking school, I have always been passionate about our native language and understand its central importance to people and communities across Wales. MOD has recently updated its Welsh Language Scheme which has further strengthened our abilities to operate bilingually in Wales whilst underlining our continuing commitment to be able to engage effectively in both Welsh and English. My role as Welsh Language Champion will help the MOD deliver its Welsh Language Scheme commitments and I will work hard to ensure we always remain an effective bilingual organisation.</p>
