<p>This data element cannot be used with self-representation.</p>

<h3>All declaration categories</h3>

<p>Exporter is defined (in Article 1(19) as:</p>

<p>a) a private individual carrying goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union where these goods are contained in the private individual’s personal baggage,<br><br>
b) other cases where a) does not apply:<br><br>
(i) a person established in the customs territory of the Union who, has the power to determine and has determined that the goods are to be taken out of that customs territory;<br>
(ii) Where (i) does not apply, any person established in the customs territory of the Union who is a party to the contract under which goods are to taken out of that customs territory.</p>

<p>Enter the full name and address of the exporter, including the postcode.</p>

<p>Where a country does not use a postcode or equivalent code, (for example, US zip code), enter ‘NA’ in this section of the data element.</p>

<p>The details of the exporter (name and address and postcode) are to be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1, as defined in Article 1(19) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1063, amending Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/2446, are to be entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 is used to declare the Exporter’s name and address and postcode. If the exporter identification reference number (<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>) quoted in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2 is recognised by <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> then <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/1 need not be completed.</p>

<h3>Name and address</h3>

<p>Enter the full name and address of the Exporter, including the postcode.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>To provide compatibility with the Export Control System (<abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr>), the ‘Name’ and ‘Street and Number’ components of this Data Element are restricted to ‘an..35’.</p>

<p>Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1063, amending Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/2446 provided additional clarification on the definition of the exporter as follows:</p>

<p>‘…the new definition of ‘exporter’ should be less restrictive and limit the conditions for being an exporter to the essential requirements for the functioning of the export procedure: the exporter must have the power to determine that the goods are to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union and, in line with Article 170(2) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, the exporter must be established in the customs territory of the Union. Only in cases where the business partners do not agree on the person who may act as exporter or the person is not established in the customs territory of the Union, the exporter is determined by the customs legislation…’</p>

<p>Please note that the consignor/exporter details (formerly Box 2) are now covered under 6 different data elements under <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where a representative/agent delegates the making of a clearance request to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the clearance request on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the clearance request’s particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (Declarant’s identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Any person may appoint a representative (agent) to perform the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules.</p>

<p>Where self-representation is used, the details entered in the Declarant (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18) and Exporter (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/2) data elements should be the same and <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code 00400 must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 (Additional Information). <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 and 3/21 (Representative) should be left blank.</p>

<h3>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the clearance request on the exporter’s/legal declarant’s behalf:</h3>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a customs clearance request in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a clearance request is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example, exporter) is completing the clearance request themselves under ‘self-representation’, they shall be liable for the content of all clearance requests so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another person’s behalf. This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: the representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person. The liability rests with the original party (usually the exporter). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original party’s instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: the representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of Council Reg. (EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<p>A customs representative shall be established within the customs territory of the Union, except where the customs representative acts upon behalf of persons who are not required to be established within the customs territory of the Union.</p>

<h3>Direct Representation:</h3>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a ‘direct’ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the clearance request under the representative’s/agent’s own user identity, the representative/agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.  The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code ‘2’.</p>

<h3>Direct representation and sub-agents:</h3>

<p>Where a representative/agent delegates the making of a clearance request to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the clearance request on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the clearance request’s particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (Declarant’s identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs clearance request and formalities on behalf of the exporter, must be declared as the Representative on the clearance request and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 (Representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party. The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the clearance request is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the exporter.</p>

<h3>Indirect Representation:</h3>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an ‘indirect’ representative in his/her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the electronic clearance request will be deemed to be acting in his/her own name and on his/her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representative’s details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>. The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code ‘3’.</p>

<h3>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</h3>

<p>Where a representative/agent delegates the making of a clearance request to a sub-agent, in an ‘indirect’ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agent’s user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarant’s identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarant’s Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the customs clearance request and formalities on behalf of the exporter must be declared as the Representative on the clearance request and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 (representative’s identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the exporter, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the exporter.</p>
