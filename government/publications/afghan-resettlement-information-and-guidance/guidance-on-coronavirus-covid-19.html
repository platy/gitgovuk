<p>Dear Guest,</p>

<p>Firstly, we would like to thank you for your continued support and efforts with reducing the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>As of the 1 April 2022, the COVID-19 guidance was updated with changes to the testing process as the country moves towards “Living with Covid”. The information below will help you, should you develop COVID-19 symptoms and advise of the steps you should take.</p>

  </li>

  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Any of these symptoms may also have another cause</strong></p>

<p>From the 1 April 2022 you are not required to take a PCR or LFT test if you have COVID-19 symptoms. As such the ability to order tests via 119 or online is no longer available.</p>

<p>If you or your family have symptoms and you are concerned that they are worsening or you are not sure what to do, please call the NHS on 111 for advice. Here is a link that may help you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://111.nhs.uk/" rel="external">Get medical help - NHS 111</a></p>

<p>If you or your child are very unwell and getting worse or you think there’s something seriously wrong, call 999.</p>

<h2>If you have COVID-19 Symptoms:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Guests over 18 should try to stay in your hotel room and avoid contact with other people for 5 days to reduce spreading the virus. This starts from the day of your symptoms or the day after you tested positive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guests under 18 has symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19, they should try and stay in their hotel room and avoid contact with other people for 3 days. This starts from the day after they did a test or the day their symptoms started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should avoid being in close contact with people at higher risk for 10 days. This is particularly important if their immune system means they’re at a higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, even if they’ve had a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meals will be delivered to your room, please contact the hotel reception desk so that arrangements can be made to deliver meals and refreshments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Vulnerable Guests</h2>

<p>COVID-19 can make anyone seriously unwell but for some people the risk is higher. For vulnerable guests, this risk is significantly reduced by vaccination.</p>

<p>People who are known to be at higher risk from COVID-19 include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>older people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who are pregnant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those who are unvaccinated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people of any age who have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">severely weakened immune system</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>people of any age with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus/" rel="external">certain long-term conditions</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Yours faithfully</strong></p>

<p><strong>Home Office ARAP/ACRS Team</strong></p>

<h2>We can all prevent the spread of COVID-19 by following the guidance below</h2>

<p>The most effective way to avoid passing on COVID-19 when symptomatic or having tested positive is to:</p>

<p>Stay in your hotel room and avoid contact with other people. This is not always possible, but you should follow the guidance as closely as possible</p>

<p>Keep your distance from other people you live with and spend as little time as possible in shared areas such as kitchens and communal areas. This is particularly important if someone you live with is unvaccinated or at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell from COVID-19, especially those with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-people-whose-immune-system-means-they-are-at-higher-risk">severely weakened immune system</a></p>

<p>If you need to leave your hotel room or spend time in shared areas wear a well- fitting face covering that fits snugly against your face and has more than 1 layer</p>

<p>Avoid indoor or crowded places (including public transport or large social  gatherings) or where there is not much fresh air</p>

<p>Cover your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of tissues into a rubbish bag and immediately wash your hands or use hand sanitiser</p>

<p>Do any exercise outdoors and where you will not be in close contact with people</p>

<p>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser after coughing, sneezing, and blowing your nose and before you eat or handle food</p>

<p>Avoid touching your face</p>

<p>Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles and remote controls, and shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms</p>

<p>Do not attend work. If you are unable to work from your hotel room, you should talk your employer about options available to you. You may be eligible <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay">Statutory Sick Pay</a></p>

<p>Ask friends &amp; family to get food and other essentials for you</p>

<p>Do not invite social visitors into your hotel room, including friends and family</p>

<p>Cancel routine medical and dental appointments. If you are concerned about your health or you have been asked to attend an appointment in person during this time, discuss this with your medical contact and let them know about your symptoms or your test result</p>
