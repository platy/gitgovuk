<p>All changes made to the page reflect previously announced requirements on schools, there are no new requirements or policies announced in this update.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following are required to hold each of these policies and other documents, and must meet the requirements that apply to their school or trust:</p>

<ul>
  <li>school leaders in all schools</li>
  <li>governing bodies in local-authority-maintained schools</li>
  <li>proprietors of academies and independent schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Schools and trusts are not always required to hold a specific policy for each requirement. It is possible to meet several requirements collectively, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>The drafting of school policies can be delegated to any member of school staff, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<p>This document covers how often each policy must be reviewed. Where it doesn’t, we strongly advise you to review the policy annually. Where there’s a change in the law or circumstances, you will need to revise your policies or documentation accordingly.</p>

<p>It also shows the level of approval required. Not all policies need to be signed off by the full governing body.</p>

<p>Throughout this guidance we use the term ‘governing body’ to represent both governing boards and trust boards.</p>

<p>There are instances where statutory guidance states that policies and procedures should be in place, although this is not the same as a legal requirement. Each piece of linked guidance which is not statutory makes clear the nature of the requirement.</p>

<p>Where possible, model policies have been included within the linked guidance. Organisations, such as your local authority, can provide free support and model policies which we suggest you consider.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>Each section sets out who the guidance applies to. Academies and free schools have greater freedoms than local-authority-maintained schools in relation to school policies and other documents.</p>

<p>We have outlined arrangements applying to these schools in legislation or in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook">funding agreements</a>. This may vary between individual academies and free schools.</p>

<h2>List of policies</h2>

<p>The table below outlines for local-authority-maintained schools and academies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each policy</li>
  <li>who it applies to</li>
  <li>the review period</li>
  <li>
    <p>approval level</p>
