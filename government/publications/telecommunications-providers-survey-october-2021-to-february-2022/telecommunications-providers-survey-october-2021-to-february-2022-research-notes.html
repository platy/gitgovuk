<p>As the UK government continues to work to support digital infrastructure in the UK, it is crucial that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport has a clear and accurate understanding of the telecommunications providers that are operating within the UK.</p>

<p>Telecommunications providers are the primary group that own and operate the UK’s digital infrastructure. Any policy proposal or government decision should consider the market structure and capabilities of telecommunications providers, as well as the impact of any intervention on these groups.</p>

<p>To further the evidence base, in the last quarter of 2021, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport commissioned Team Telemarketing LTD to conduct a telephone based market research survey aimed at telecommunications providers in the UK.</p>

<p>The purpose of the telecoms market research survey is to help further understand and classify the types of providers of telecommunications networks and/or services in the UK. This includes understanding more about the number of telecoms providers operating in the UK including their size, activities of companies providing electronic telecommunications networks and services as well as the segments they operate in and their expected growth and whether they will be affected by the Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021. The telecoms market research survey is designed for DCMS to gain a better understanding of telecommunications providers to further support the development of the UK’s digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>Please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Shamraze.Mahmood@dcms.gov.uk">Shamraze.Mahmood@dcms.gov.uk</a> if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results in more detail.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The telecoms market research survey ran from 1st December 2021 to 3rd February 2022.</li>
  <li>This project was undertaken by Team Telemarketing LTD who was awarded the contract through Invitation To Tender.</li>
  <li>Team Telemarketing LTD sourced a dataset of 4,101 records.</li>
  <li>From the dataset of 4,101 records, over 18,000 calls were made to companies in the dataset of which 759 business owners/business decision makers were spoken to.</li>
  <li>450 telephone surveys were completed. A further 309 companies that were contacted were screened out on the opening qualifying question due to not being in scope (not providing an Electronic Communication Network, Electronic Communication Service or Associated Facility).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The project is comprised of two phases:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Develop a comprehensive list of the types of company that can be considered a ‘telecommunications provider’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out research into the characteristics of telecommunications providers by surveying a sample of telecommunications providers operating in the UK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For phase 1 of the project, the definitions in section 32 of the Communications Act 2003 were used as a starting point to identify the types of companies that could be considered as a ‘telecommunications provider’. The research then also considered other telecommunications providers that are not clearly defined in the Communications Act.</p>

<p>Team Telemarketing LTD researched the SIC codes linked to the telecommunications industry and identified four SIC codes that companies are registered under. They are 61100, 61200, 61300 and 61900.</p>

<p>Team Telemarketing sourced a dataset of 4,101 records that were not registered as TPS or CTPS<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and therefore could be contacted for research purposes.</p>

<p>The dataset is broken down as follows:</p>

<table class="js-barchart-table mc-auto-outdent">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Total (all businesses)</td>
      <td>4101</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Micro (0 to 9)</td>
      <td>2796</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Small (10 to 49)</td>
      <td>980</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Medium-sized (50 to 249)</td>
      <td>285</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Large (250+)</td>
      <td>40</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The data sourced by Team Telemarketing LTD is a representative sample of the telecoms industry as a whole and was purchased for the second phase of the project.</p>

<p>For phase 2 of the project, Team Telemarketing LTD and DCMS identified the survey sample required for each size bracket that will reflect the number of companies within the telecommunications SIC codes.</p>

<p>The survey then commenced on 1st of December 2021 and ended on the 3rd of February 2022.</p>

<h2>Caveat</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Please bear in mind the sample size when referring to any survey results.</li>
  <li>This was a data gathering exercise to understand the types of companies from all sizes with a specific focus on micro and small companies.</li>
  <li>Results from the survey are unweighted, with each business assigned the same weight regardless of turnover or size.</li>
  <li>Self-selection bias may be present. Therefore, responses are illustrative and they should be treated with caution as results reflect the characteristics of those who completed the survey and not necessarily the wider business population.</li>
</ul>
