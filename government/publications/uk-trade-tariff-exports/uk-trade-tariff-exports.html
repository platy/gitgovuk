<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>The law</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>All goods exported from the UK to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> countries must be declared to customs</h3>

<p>In the UK all export declarations must be made electronically to the National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>). Electronic declarations can be made by the exporter or their appointed representative to Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>). In some circumstances (for example a personal export) customs will enter export details to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> on behalf of the exporter.</p>

<p>More about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-exports/uk-trade-tariff-exports#manual-procedures">manual declarations.</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>The legal provisions governing export declarations</h3>

<p>The legal provisions governing export declarations are included in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations and National legislation below.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Regulations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 952/2013 Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) commission delegating and implementing regulations 2015/2446 and 2015/2447</li>
  <li>Commission implementing regulation</li>
</ul>

<p>National Law:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customs and Excise Management Act (<abbr title="Customs and Excise Management Act">CEMA</abbr>) 1979 as amended by SI 1991 no 2724 - Section 52-68 (exports) commissioners’ directions 2002</li>
  <li>Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 467</li>
  <li>Value Added Tax Act 1994 - Section 16.1</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Export Control System (<abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr>) and safety and security</h3>

<p><abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr> controls indirect exports by exchanging electronic messages with other member states. <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> legislation requires pre-departure information which will be risk assessed in advance of the export movement. Pre-departure declarations can take the form of a customs declaration, a re-export declaration or an exit summary declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Deadlines for the lodgement of pre-departure declarations</h3>

<p>The delegated regulation gives minimum deadlines for lodging export declarations. Full details can be found in Article 244 of (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) regulation 952/2013, in summary it states that the deadline is at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li>24 hours before the goods are loaded for containerised cargo</li>
  <li>30 minutes before departure from an airport for air traffic</li>
  <li>1 hour before departure for road and inland waterways traffic</li>
  <li>2 hours before the goods leave <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> territory for rail traffic</li>
</ul>

<p>Some commercial carriers (particularly in the maritime industry), may need the information included in an export declaration before the statutory deadlines, so they can meet safety, security and commercial responsibilities.</p>

<p>Find more on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-exports/uk-trade-tariff-exports#the-national-export-system-nes-and-the-export-control-system-ecs">new requirements.</a></p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - exports which are not customs cleared before 1 May 2016 will be released under the UCC provisions.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Making an export declaration</h3>

<p>Declarations may be made by any person who is able to present the goods in question, or to have them presented, with all the supporting documentation required. Where acceptance of a declaration imposes obligations on a specific person, the declaration must be made by that person or on their behalf. The declarant must be established in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. However, the conditions regarding establishment in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> shall not apply to person who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a declaration for transit or for temporary admission</li>
  <li>declare goods only on an occasional basis, provided that the customs authorities consider this to be justified</li>
</ul>

<p>Any person may appoint a representative to perform the acts and formalities laid down by customs rules. Representation may be by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a direct representative - acts in the name of, and on behalf of, another person</li>
  <li>an indirect representative - acts in their own name but on behalf of another person</li>
</ul>

<p>A representative must state that they are acting on behalf of the person represented and specify whether that representation is direct or indirect and be empowered to act as the representative. Failure to comply on any of these conditions will result in the person concerned being deemed to be acting in their own name on their own behalf.</p>

<p>Article 15 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) provides that without prejudice to the possible application of penal provisions, the lodging of a declaration by the declarant or their representative shall render them responsible under the provisions in force for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the accuracy of the information given in the declaration</li>
  <li>the authenticity of the documents attached</li>
  <li>compliance with all the obligations relating to the entry of the goods in question under the procedure concerned</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that although there is no pre-printed declaration on the form as to the accuracy of the information it contains, the submitter of the declaration is legally responsible for its accuracy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Indirect exports</h3>

<p>An indirect export means goods are declared for export in one <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> member state and then leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state. The office where the goods are declared and presented for export is the customs office of export. The office where the goods leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> is the customs office of exit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>Direct exports</h3>

<p>Direct exports are where the whole of an export operation takes place in the territory of a single member state. The customs office where the declaration is presented can be both an office of export and an Office of Exit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Tariff data held on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the Tariff data held on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and to incorporate changes and corrections as promptly as possible. However, in cases where the information on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is at variance with that contained in the appropriate <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation published in the ‘Official Journal of the European Communities’, the latter will represent the correct legal position.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Export declarations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Full export declarations</h3>

<p>Full declarations are needed for most goods being exported outside the customs territory of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> as defined in Article 4 of regulation (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>).</p>

<p>They are also required for goods being sent to one of the following special territories of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Aland Islands (Finland)</li>
  <li>the Canary Islands</li>
  <li>the Channel Islands</li>
  <li>French Overseas Department of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte and Reunion Mount Athos ⁄ also known as Agion Poros (Greece)</li>
</ul>

<p>Common Agricultural Policy (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) goods exported to entitled destinations as provided for in Article 36 of Regulation 800/99 may also need a full export declaration. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supplies within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> for victualling on seagoing vessels or aircraft serving on international routes, including intra-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> routes</li>
  <li>supplies to international organisations in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>
</li>
  <li>supplies to armed forces stationed in the territory of a member state but not serving under its command</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Simplified export procedures</h3>

<p>Simplified export procedures change under the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>. <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> implementation has removed Local Clearance Procedure (<abbr title="Local Clearance Procedure">LCP</abbr>) as a simplification.</p>

<p>The simplifications available are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr>)</li>

<span class="number">3.1 </span><abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> is the UK’s national export system. Under <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> all export entries are processed electronically through the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Master Reference Number</h3>

<p>Under the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> the Movement Reference Number is renamed as the Master Reference Number (<abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr>).</p>

<p>All export declarations are issued with an <abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr>. This is a key reference generated by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. The <abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr> is generated for both direct and indirect exports.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Office of export</h3>

<p>Where the export goods that have been entered onto <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> are to leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state (an indirect export), a message is sent from the Office of Export to the member state of exit, informing them of the details of the goods that are on their way.</p>

<p>On exit from the member state the Office of Exit they will send an exit result response to the UK to say that the goods have left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This response message is passed back to the trader through <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to facilitate zero rating VAT claims. The outgoing message is triggered by the completion of box 29 (Office of Exit).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Full export declaration</h3>

<p>The usual method of providing details of exports is by electronically completing a full export declaration into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="#introduction-to-export-declarations">rules around the data requirements for the full declaration.</a></p>

<p>Except in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-export-prohibitions-and-restrictions">specific circumstances</a> there’ll be no need to present pre-shipment supporting documents to customs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> export refund goods must always be declared on a full export declaration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>This procedure allows authorised traders to submit a pre-shipment advice (<abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>) containing fewer data elements than a full export declaration at the time of export but should include the safety and security data set out in Annex B of the delegated regulation.</p>

<p>Under <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>, the <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr> must be followed within 14 days of receiving permission to progress (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) by a post- shipment supplementary declaration. All <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr> and supplementary declarations must be submitted electronically.</p>

<p>Find more on the <a class="govuk-link" href="#export-completion-rules-sad-c88ess-boxes">data requirements by box for all types of declaration.</a></p>

<p>Except in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-export-prohibitions-and-restrictions">specific circumstances</a>, there will be no need to present pre-shipment supporting documents to customs, though they will need to be retained for audit purposes.</p>

<p>There are no circumstances when consignments exported under <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> can be declared on the same electronic (C88/ESS) as consignments for which a full declaration is required.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - under the UCC transition period, traders authorised for SDP can continue with their current authorisations until they are re-authorised by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> allows a trader to lodge their customs declaration in their own records. Applicants will need to fulfil certain Authorised Economic Operator (<abbr title="Authorised Economic Operator">AEO</abbr>) criteria, (Articles 39(a) (b) (d) of 952/2013).</p>

<p>For exports, <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> can only be used where both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the requirement for a pre-departure declaration is waived (Article 182 of <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>, Article 150  and 245 of Delegated Regulation), and</li>
  <li>the export  is a direct export</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> can’t be used for excise goods, unless Article 30 of directive 2008/118/EC is applicable.</p>

<p>Where an authorisation for <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> is set up, a control plan has to be put in place in accordance with Article 182910 of 952/2013 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>, providing for the supervision of the <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> procedure. Obligations of the holder of the procedure are set out in Article 227 Implementing Regulation.</p>

<p>There will also be revised datasets for simplified declarations which will be applied once the upgrade from CHIEF to CDS is completed. A C21 will still be required to remove the goods from the air port inventory system.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Exit Summary Declaration (<abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>An electronic <abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr> into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> is only required when goods departing the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> are not covered by an export declaration or re-export declaration containing safety and security data. They must be submitted to the customs office of exit.</p>

<p>Article 271 of 952/2013 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> defines who can lodge the <abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Examples of when an <abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr> is required are:</p>

<ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Designated export place (<abbr title="designated export place">DEP</abbr>)</h3>
<p>Currently a <abbr title="designated export place">DEP</abbr> allows authorised operators to consolidate and clear goods at approved premises considered to be a frontier location before their removal to the air port.

<span class="number">4.9 </span>Disaster relief/humanitarian aid</h3>

<p>The UK practices a recommendation of the World Customs Organisation (<abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr>) aimed at speeding up the release of relief consignments. The <abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr> recommendation provides for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>official certification of lists of the contents of relief consignments</li>
  <li>the securing of goods under customs seals to aid the passage of goods through the territories of other <abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr> signatory countries and their eventual admission into the destination country</li>
</ul>

<p>While these types of consignments are routinely expedited by customs, they must comply with all normal export procedures including pre-entry, export licensing or any other export restrictions and controls.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span>Special arrangements for goods and supplies to offshore installations</h3>

<p>Special arrangements are available for goods delivered to Non UK Offshore installations. Goods from the UK or other UK installations are to be treated as exports. Offshore installations are deemed as equipment and devices installed in the high sea in order to search for and exploit mineral resources. Non-UK installations are deemed as installations of which the natural or legal person responsible for the commercial use is established in a non-UK country.</p>

<p>These arrangements cannot be used for goods exported that are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subject to export licensing (and equivalent certification)</li>
  <li>subject to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> control requirements</li>
  <li>from registered, entered or licensed premises</li>
  <li>subject to a claim for excise drawback</li>
</ul>

<p>Where special arrangements apply, the electronic C88/ESS must be completed as a normal <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>, but with the specified commodity code (box 33) as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>99312400 Goods from Chapters 1 to 24 of the Harmonised System</li>
  <li>99312700 Goods from Chapter 27 of the Harmonised System</li>
  <li>99319900 Goods Classified elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>The information required is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>country code of installation</li>
  <li>the quantity in net mass</li>
  <li>the value</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span>Simplifications for exports of industrial plant component parts</h3>

<p>‘Industrial plant’ is defined in the statistical legislation as ‘a combination of machines, apparatus, appliances, equipment, instruments and materials which together make up large-scale, stationery units producing goods or providing services’. The essential character of the overall product is assigned to the most appropriate commodity within the CN.</p>

<p>‘Component part’ is defined as ‘a delivery for an industrial plant which is made up of goods which all belong to the same chapter of the CN’.</p>

<p>Where the overall statistical value of the industrial plant is in excess of 3 million euros (approximately £2.5 million), exports of component parts may be classified as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first 4 digits shall be 9880</li>
  <li>the fifth and sixth digits shall correspond to the CN chapter to which the goods of the component part belong</li>
  <li>the seventh and eighth digits shall be 0</li>
</ul>

<p>For quantity, only the net mass is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span>Arrangements for ships and aircraft stores and supplies</h3>

<p>Special arrangements are in place for the simplified reporting of the supply of certain goods to non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> owned vessels and aircraft that are visiting a UK port or airport. These arrangements are for stores and supplies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for the consumption by passengers and crew or for the operation of the engines, machines or other equipment during the journey</li>
  <li>delivered to a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (and non-UK) owned ship or aircraft visiting a UK port or airport</li>
</ul>

<p>Stores and supplies for the consumption by passengers and crew refers to goods ‘consumed’ by them, for example, food and drink. Stores and supplies for the operation of engines and machinery refer to goods such as oil and fuel.</p>

<p>These arrangements cannot be used for goods exported that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stores and supplies delivered to vessels and aircraft located in the territory of another country (ie outside the UK)</li>
  <li>durable goods which remain on the vessel or aircraft (eg bed linen, TV sets for cabins)</li>
</ul>

<p>For goods eligible to use these arrangements, an electronic export declaration is completed as normal. However, the following simplified codes should be used:</p>

<h4>Country of destination:</h4>

<p>The country code ‘QS’ should be used in box 17a.</p>

<p>Country code ‘QS’ cannot be used for deliveries to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (but not UK) owned vessels or aircraft. These deliveries are reported on the Intrastat system using the code ‘QR’.</p>

<h4>Commodity code:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>9930 2400 Goods from Chapters 1 to 24</li>
  <li>9930 2700 Goods from Chapter 27</li>
  <li>9930 9900 Goods classified elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>The above commodity codes cannot be used for goods subject to <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> Export Refunds or deliveries from customs or excise warehouses. In such cases, the actual commodity code must be used.</p>

<p>Details of the name and nationality of the vessel or aircraft on which the stores or supplies are loaded or are ultimately destined must be declared in box 44. Packing lists to support the declaration as ships stores/supplies must also be made available on request by customs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.13 </span>Postal exports</h3>

<p>With the exception of goods held under one of the customs special procedures and other goods not in free circulation, most postal exports only require the international postal customs declarations. These are the green label (form CN22) for letter post and the white label (form CN23) for parcel post.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-143-a-guide-for-international-post-users">Notice 143 ‘A Guide to International Post Users’</a> gives information about those exports where an export declaration is required. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">Notice 3001</a> contains details about temporary admission, inward processing and outward processing relief.</p>

<p>The green or white labels should normally accompany each package, unless they are going to another member state (except for packages sent to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#specialterritories">special territories</a>).</p>

<p>Packages that contain goods not in free circulation within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> must also be accompanied by a Yellow Label (form C1130) if they are being sent to another member state or to Turkey. You can obtain more information from The Royal Mail International Service Guide or The Parcelforce International, International User Guide, these should be available at any main Post Office.</p>

<p>You will need a certificate of posting on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-certificate-of-posting-of-goods-ce132">form C&amp;E132</a> for goods subject to specific control.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.14 </span>Preference exports</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> has a number of preferential trade agreements with certain individual countries or groups of countries. These enable goods manufactured in accordance with specified rules to be imported at a nil or lower rate of duty, these agreements are normally reciprocal.</p>

<p>Such goods may be exported under cover of a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-movement-certificate-eur1-c1299">movement certificate EUR1</a> (or subject to a value limit, an invoice declaration), on which the exporter declares that the goods meet the conditions required for its issue.

<p><abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr> is an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> sponsored registration system that authorises exporters in General System of Preference (<abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr>) beneficiary countries to issue a self-certificate (known as a statement on origin) for eligible goods to be imported under preference to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The statement on origin replaces the <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> form A and invoice declaration. <abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr> traders will be issued with a number by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, which they will include on their statements on origin made on their commercial documents such as a delivery note or packing list. These documents may be transmitted and stored electronically.</p>

<p>Importers should always be able to obtain the required statement and have it available for presentation if necessary, at the time of release of the goods to free circulation and should no longer have to provide security for the full rate of duty payable because the required proof of origin is not available at the time preference is claimed.</p>

<p>Proofs of origin must still be retained for 3 years from when the goods were released to free circulation.</p>

<p>The following UK traders will be able to apply for <abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr> registration from 1 January 2017:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK traders who export materials to <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> beneficiary countries that are used to manufacture products to be imported to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (known as bi-lateral cumulation) - as of 1 January 2018 EUR1’s will no longer be issued for bi-lateral cumulation with <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> beneficiary countries</li>
  <li>UK established re-consignors of <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> goods to other member states, for the purpose of issuing replacement statements on origin</li>
</ul>

<p>Customs representatives are not eligible for <abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr> registration.</p>

<p>From 1 October 2017 the European Commission will make available via the internet a central database of exporters registered to export under the <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr>. UK companies importing under the <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> will be able to consult it prior to importation, to confirm the registration number of their supplier.</p>

<p><abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr> will be phased in for all <abbr title="General System of Preference">GSP</abbr> beneficiary countries from 1 January 2017 to 31 July 2020. The Commission will publish details of those countries implementing <abbr title="Registered Exporter">REX</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.16 </span>Exports from approved warehouses</h3>

<p>Exports from warehouses approved for customs warehousing or excise warehousing must be declared using the appropriate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-customs-procedure-codes">customs procedure code (<abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr>)</a> in box 37. As different <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPCs</abbr> can apply to each type of warehousing, it is essential to insert the correct <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> applicable to the consignment concerned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.17 </span>Excise goods</h3>

<p>Certain goods which are produced in the UK and liable to Excise Duty can be exported from registered or entered excise premises without payment of duty. The goods affected by these provisions are wine and made-wine, cider and perry, beer, tobacco products, hydrocarbon oil and methylated spirits. The goods to be exported must be pre-entered on a Single Administrative Document (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>) or National Export System (<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>) equivalent indicating the appropriate <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> in box 37. For tobacco products, a specification of goods must be attached to the pre-shipment declaration giving details of the packages.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Manual procedures</h2>

<p>All declarations are expected to be made electronically, if you don’t have access to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> you should consider arranging for a third party to submit the declaration on your behalf. Sometimes it may be necessary to use the manual process. For example, someone taking commercial goods with them in their baggage to raise sales for a new company that does not yet have access to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before any goods can be granted Permission to Progress (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) and leave the country they must be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Manual processing is carried out by the National Clearance Hub at Salford.</p>

<p>Manual declarations will be processed according to the Department’s Charter Standards. However, they are likely to take longer to be processed than those submitted electronically to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by or on behalf of the exporter/declarant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>) numbers</h2>

<p>The use of a <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> is mandatory for all <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> declarations, it is the means by which you and customs can identify your goods to your records.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is a reference of up to 35 characters (plus an optional numeric ‘Part’ identity) allocated by a trader to a consignment of goods and recorded on the relevant customs declaration(s). <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will initially ensure that a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is unique and once it is recorded on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> cannot be amended.</p>

<p><abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> must be included on all Full Export Declarations, C21 customs clearance requests, Exit Summary Declarations and on both <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr> and Supplementary Declarations submitted by traders authorised for simplified procedures.</p>

<p>For simplified procedures, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> links the <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr> to the Supplementary Declaration(s) and provides an audit trail in the authorised traders’ records. Linking <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr> to Supplementary Declarations is the only instance where a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> can exist more than once. If there’s more than one <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> per <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part field is used to make the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> unique for each shipment under the <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The standard format of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> used in the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> is based on the recommended World Customs Organisation draft which is up to 35 characters in length in 4 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first part - the year the <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> was allocated, for example ‘5’ if allocated in 2015</li>
  <li>second part - the country where the <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> was allocated. Typically ‘GB’ for UK export declarations</li>
  <li>third part - the identity of the (authorised) trader as known to customs. In the UK this will be the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>, followed by a hyphen</li>
  <li>fourth part - a unique (within a trader’s system) series of characters which a trader devises which provides an audit trail within their commercial accounting systems (this part is restricted to numbers between 0 to 9, upper case letters A to Z or a hyphen’-’)</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> based on the above is ‘2GB123456789012-ABC1234’. Any unused spaces should be left blank, unlike the ARC number, that is, you do not need to include zeros to make the length the full 35 characters.</p>

<p>There’s an additional field of 4 characters that may be used in conjunction with the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>. This field contains the Check Letter calculation automatically generated by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and which may be used to guard against mis-keying.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> doesn’t insist that a Check Letter is input, when a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is used against a movement, but when one is input, it is checked and the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> rejected if found not to match that generated at the time of declaration input.</p>

<p>The remaining 3 characters in this field are for the optional input of a Part identity and which allows several export declarations to have the same core Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>. It is this, in combination with the (up to) 35 character <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> which must be unique.</p>

<p>An example of Part identity use would be a large consignment covered by a single <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> but being exported on 3 vessels over a period of weeks or months. Ideally, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would use a common identifier in the trader’s records, but each movement of the goods would have a separate <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declaration, using the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> but designated as Part 001, 002 and 003.</p>

<p><abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> have been implemented on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> so that <abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr> <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> standards are compatible with <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>, allowing non-UK <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> to be quoted on <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> declarations.</p>

<p>For traders authorised for simplified procedures the same Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) must be supplied on both the <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr> and linked <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> to supply an audit trail into the traders’ records.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - datasets for export declarations will be revised under UCC IT implementation. Any changes to datasets will be implemented once the upgrade from CHIEF to CDS is completed. This may mean that the configuration of the UCR, or the data field it is entered to may change.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Master Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>) consolidation</h3>

<p>Whereas a declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> directly relates to an individual <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> declaration, master <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr> are normally used to associate or link several declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr>. For example, when a container holds a number of consignments from different exporters, each of whom has a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Rather than quoting many individual <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> for each consignment or consolidators, the inventory systems can advise <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> that each of the Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr> in the container is associated with a single Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>. Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr> can be associated with other Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr>. Although a Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> can be associated with one or many Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment References">UCRs</abbr> a Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> can only belong to one Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Association can be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the time of declaration by advising the declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> and master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> on the declaration</li>
  <li>by authorised traders (such as consolidators and inventory systems) on arrival (anticipated and/or actual) at a customs controlled location-by providing the Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> and Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> in the arrival message</li>
  <li>by an explicit association transaction through which one can also -
    <ul>
      <li>dis-associate a <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> from a Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>
</li>
      <li>associate a Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> or Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> with a (higher level) Master <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> MUCRs have one of the formats listed below</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>For Air</h4>

<p>Use ‘A’ followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>either 3 alpha characters</li>
  <li>a maximum of 8 numbers</li>
  <li>a maximum length of 13 characters overall</li>
</ul>

<h4>For courier traffic</h4>

<p>Use ‘C’ followed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 alpha characters</li>
  <li>at least 3 more alphanumeric</li>
</ul>

<p>The courier <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> must be at least 8 numbers long.</p>

<h4>Other <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> formats</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>GB/iii-s…s - GB = country, then followed by 3 characters identifying the inventory system and then at least another 5 alpha/numeric characters (minimum 12 characters in total)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GB/iiii-s…s - same as above yet with 4 character inventory reference (minimum 13 characters in total)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GB/<abbr title="Trader’s Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr>-s…s - GB, followed by the slash, then a valid <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>, hyphen and then at least one alpha or numeric character</p>

</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - datasets for export declarations will be revised under the UCC IT implementation.

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Bulk Consignment Reference (Bulk <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>An export declaration usually covers a single consignment from one exporter however, for groupage consignments an agent/representative can submit one declaration for consignments for up to 99 different commodities on behalf of up to 99 separate consignors and consignees.</p>

<p>The bulk <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> is not supported as a reference by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, and does not need to be unique, however, the declarants must be able to use this bulk <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> to trace consignments back through their records.</p>

<p>Bulk declarations are not permitted for licensable goods, goods on which a <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> refund is being claimed or Inward Processing (<abbr title="Inward Processing">IP</abbr>) goods being re-exported.</p>

<p>If the consignor/exporter is the same for all items, box 2 of the declaration (Consignor/Exporter) must only be declared at the header level. If there is more than one consignor details of each consignee are to be supplied at item level.</p>

<p>Freight agents are not to be entered in box 2 unless they are the owners of the goods or have similar right of disposal over them at the time when the declaration is accepted.</p>

<p>If there is only one consignee, the consignee details in box 8 should be supplied at header level. If there is more than one consignee details of each consignee are to be supplied at item level.</p>

<p>There are separate arrangements for Fast Parcel Operators who have been granted approval for <abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> status.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Other references</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span><abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The use of a trader’s <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is mandatory for almost all export declarations. The <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number consists of <a class="govuk-link" href="#EORInumber">a 9 digit VAT registration number prefixed with GB (without spaces) plus a suffix of 3 zeros</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Private exporters</h3>

<p>For all private exports where there is no commercial interest (personal goods) GBPR can be used in box 2 of the declaration. However, the conditions that apply are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full name and address of the GBPR individual must be entered into box 44 (miscellaneous text box)</li>
  <li>for personal goods in free circulation <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 10 00 096 can be entered into box 37</li>
  <li>for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-export-prohibitions-and-restrictions">goods subject to licensing or customs controls</a>, the appropriate <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> should be entered in box 37 and the declarant’s <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number used in box 2</li>

</ul>

<p><abbr title="Customs Procedure with Economic Impact">CPEI</abbr> re-export <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> must be entered in box 37.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will not accept the entry unless these mandatory fields are completed as stated above. Export entries entered to GBPR cannot be used as official evidence for VAT zero rating purposes as they are deemed non-commercial exports.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Processing of export declarations</h2>

<p>Export declarations must be positively cleared by customs before the goods are allowed to leave the UK. Clearance can only be obtained through the provision of a goods arrival message that formally enters the goods into customs control (legal acceptance).</p>

<p>Following the input of the goods arrival message, the message sender will receive a routing by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, either holding the goods for examination or documentary checks or giving the goods permission to progress (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>).</p>

<p>Find <a class="govuk-link" href="#dataitemsGAM">data items required in an arrival message.</a></p>

<p>It is the message sender’s responsibility to disclose the route to the exporter, agent and/or loader, depending on where the declaration was first lodged and by whom.</p>

<p>The goods departure message is given when the goods leave the UK. This message provides exporters evidence of export for VAT zero-rating and other customs reliefs, by electronic means for both customs and the trade.</p>

<p>Find <a class="govuk-link" href="#dataitemsGDM">data items required in a departure message.</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>When are arrival/departure messages not required?</h3>

<p>These are goods that leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via the UK.</p>

<p>The UK acts as an office of export and office of exit for goods that leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via the UK. Goods that are to be shipped directly to a third country must arrive and depart at the frontier air port.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> processing the goods arrival message is triggered within <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> as this status will have been given at the inland premises for clearing the port inventory.</p>

<p>Goods that are to be shipped directly to a third country must re-arrive and depart at the frontier air port.</p>

<h4>Indirect exports</h4>

<p>These are goods that will exit the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state and are covered by an Export Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>), which provides evidence of exit from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>Indirect exports must arrive at the frontier air port, that is the port of departure from the UK. This applies to the majority of UK exports.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> these goods do not need to re-enter at the frontier. The exception is excise goods and <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> refund goods, which must always re-arrive at the frontier, for example the air port of departure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Community system providers (<abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The majority of UK exports go through ports/airports and systems run by <abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr>. <abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr> operate cargo inventory control systems at most of the UK’s ports and airports, and at a number of inland locations. These systems can also control the movement of cargo within the port and between remote, inventory linked locations.</p>

<p>The customs export declaration and the cargo are linked by the inventory control system using the Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>) number. The various messages produced by the <abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr> systems provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the necessary audit links for control</li>
  <li>exception reports and cargo accounting mechanisms for air or sea port control purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2 important messages for customs control are the goods arrival message and the goods departure message.</p>

<p>At inventory linked locations these messages will be automatically sent to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by the <abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr> inventory control systems.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Non inventory linked environments (<abbr title="Non-inventory linked environments">NILE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Non inventory linked ports, docks and wharves (those not operating Inventory Control Systems) must also provide <a class="govuk-link" href="#manualarrdeptmsg">goods arrival and departure messages</a> to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The goods <a class="govuk-link" href="#dataitemsGAM">arrival message</a> should be sent by the person or company that has physical control of the goods from the time they reach the port. This is usually the responsibility of the ‘loader’.</p>

<p>Approved loaders are issued with <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> badges and roles allowing them to send arrival and departure messages to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> via the web.</p>

<p>The goods departure message should be sent by the loader within 12 hours of the vessel departing the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The goods arrival and departure messages will trigger responses from <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, and these will be recorded as versions of the declaration and create an auditable record of events.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>How arrival and departure messages are sent</h3>

<p>These messages are submitted to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr></li>
  <li>internet web forms</li>
  <li>internet email using EDIFACT message attachments</li>
  <li>XML ‘wrap around’ EDIFACT messages</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#manualarrdeptmsg">customs <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> facilities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of electronic transmission will depend on volume, required speed of response, balanced against costs and other business needs.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr> route has a high level of functionality and will allow the message sender to view and arrive/depart declarations ‘online’. Multiple declarations can be arrived and departed in on transmission and response times are immediate. This route is usually part of a much wider air or sea port management operation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span>Manual arrival and departure messages</h3>

<p>If you’re unable to provide electronic arrival and/or departure messages <a class="govuk-link" href="#otherdocs">you may be permitted to provide a paper declaration C88/ESS</a> and load list. This will contain all the relevant details (including the data elements incorporated within the goods arrival message) together with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-presentation-of-goods-for-export-arrival-c1601">form C1601</a> and must be presented to customs to be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> (within Charter Standards) before <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> can give permission to progress. Details are to be faxed to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>.</p>

<p>For goods departure information must be supplied using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notification-of-exit-of-goods-c1602-departure">form C1602</a> within 12 hours of the departure time of the exporting vessel/aircraft.</p>

<p>Paper documents will only be accepted by the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> for input of arrival/departure messages.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span>Data items required in a goods arrival message</h3>

<p>A goods arrival message can be either for an individual consignment declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) or for a consolidation Master Unique Consignment Reference <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>). The message may also advise of a consolidation associating the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>The arrival message must contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>custom entry reference (Entry Processing Unit - Entry Number - Date)</li>
  <li><abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr></li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> if appropriate</li>
  <li>goods location code - box 30</li>
  <li>where appropriate, shed identify if one exists - box 30</li>
</ul>

<p>Border Force anti-smuggling teams may also need to take action because the goods arrival message usually only provides fiscal clearance. Non inventory linked locations do not have an anti-smuggling net (as provided by <abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr> at inventory linked ports) and even though <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> may give ‘permission to progress’ it may be that local anti-smuggling staff will want to intercept. These arrangements are agreed locally between the loader and customs management.</p>

<p>If this happens the anti-smuggling staff will need details of the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>port of origin</li>
  <li>port of destination</li>
  <li>country of destination</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - datasets for export declarations will be revised under UCC IT implementation. Any changes to datasets will be put in place once the upgrade from CHIEF to CDS is completed. This may mean that the content of the arrival message may change.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span>Arrival of split loads/multiple deliveries</h3>

<h4>Frontiers declarations</h4>

<p>The goods arrival message for frontier clearance establishes the date into customs control. The exception is <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, where an export declaration has goods split over multiple containers/loads, a goods arrival message can be submitted for each part of the consignment.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods</h4>

<p>The rules are different for the export of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, because the date of acceptance into customs control determines the refund rate and licence attribution. When an export declaration has <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods split over multiple containers/loads, it is a requirement that all of these goods must be available to customs’ satisfaction. This means they must all be onsite at the port/airport, before the goods arrival message  is entered to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.
<br><br>
If the <abbr title="goods arrival message">GAM</abbr> is entered before all the <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods are available to custom’s satisfaction, the goods may be delayed for further checking. If all of the declared goods are not onsite before the arrival message is entered the declarant may be subject to civil penalty action by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and administrative penalty action by the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>).</p>

<h4>Inland declarations (<abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>)</h4>

<p>Consignments under <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> may also be travelling in more than one container/load. It is a requirement that all of the goods must be available at the nominated inland location at the goods available ‘from’ time. For <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> cleared goods exiting the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state no further messaging is required in the UK.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> goods shipping direct to a third country, will require a second goods arrival message to be entered into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. With the exception of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods, for goods split over multiple containers/ loads the same facility for multiple arrivals is available (see above).</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods</h4>

<p>For export declarations with <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> goods split over multiple containers/loads all of these goods must be available to custom’s satisfaction. This means they must all be onsite at the inland location at the ‘goods available from time’ (when the first goods arrival message  will be entered to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) and afterwards all of these goods must be onsite at the port/airport before the second goods arrival message  is entered to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Non complaint <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> traders will be subject to the same penalties as above.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.8 </span>Data items required in a goods departure message</h3>

<p>The goods departure message can be either for an individual consignment <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) or for a consolidation <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>). For a consolidation, <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will record as departed declarations recorded on the system. Although messages may be received out of the logical sequence of (pre-lodge/arrival/departure), it will highlight to customs as possible non-compliance issues and restrict trader’s future use of their <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> badges.</p>

<p>If a consignment is transported on a number of separate vessels, then departure should be advised repeatedly with the different transport details.</p>

<p>The departure message must contain all of the following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr></li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> if appropriate</li>
  <li>date of departure</li>
  <li>place of loading - box 27</li>
  <li>transport mode code - box 25</li>
  <li>exporting vessel name - box 21</li>
  <li>flag code - box 21</li>
</ul>

<p>If all of this information is not supplied then the departure message will be ‘frustrated’ and the Status of Entry (<abbr title="Status of Entry">SOE</abbr>) code will default to status ‘D’ indicating that the goods have been removed inland. This may affect your VAT Zero rating.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - datasets for export declarations will be revised under the UCC IT implementation. Any changes to datasets will be put in place once the upgrade from CHIEF to CDS is complete. This may mean that the content of the arrival message may change.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.9 </span>Who can submit arrival and departure messages</h3>

<p>The person/company giving the goods arrival and goods departure messages must be approved to do so. The ‘role’ that allows arrival and departure message transactions in <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> can only be given to an Approved Loader who has had their Loader procedures verified by <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Without this ‘role’ you will not be able to input either message.</p>

<p>If you want to become an Approved Loader please contact the Export Presentation Approvals Team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:exportpresentationapprovals@hmrc.gov.uk">exportpresentationapprovals@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If arrival or departure messages are required for a roll on roll off location, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sending-goods-to-the-eu-through-roll-on-roll-off-ports-or-the-channel-tunnel">roll on roll off guidance</a> as in most circumstances the ‘arrived declaration’ facilitation removes the requirement for an Approved Loader.</p>

<p>For more detailed information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/chief-user-guides-and-technical-specifications"><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> user guides and technical specifications</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.10 </span>What happens if an export declaration is not arrived</h3>

<p>When data is entered to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> for export but the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is not arrived, customs will contact the declarant (the person placing the data onto <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) using an automated print (P9) that explains that data needs to be actioned.</p>

<p>This P9 print is generated automatically 22 days after data has been input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. The print is recognised by the declarant under its reference P9. This print confirms the export reference number and reminds the declarant that the data remains on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The P9 print also gives the legislation governing arrivals within <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> (Statutory Instrument 2003 No 467) and the possible imposition of customs civil penalties (<abbr title="customs civil penalties">CCPs</abbr>) should action not be taken.</p>

<p>It’s important that data queried under the P9 procedure is correctly processed as routine cancellation/deletion may prevent VAT zero rating, <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> refunds or gain export reliefs.</p>

<p>Declarants that fail to take action will see their entry data automatically deleted from <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> after a further 38 days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.11 </span>What action should be taken to resolve P9 generated enquiries for non-arrived exports</h3>

<p>Customs expects the declarant to fully investigate where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the export is still to take place</li>
  <li>the goods have physically been exported</li>
</ul>

<p>The declarant should make sure that these details are then confirmed through to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Where the export has still to take place</h4>

<p>Consideration should be given to extending the life of the data to avoid systems deletion. This can be done via <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> format AEXD.</p>

<p>Insert the Entry Processing Unit (<abbr title="Entry Processing Unit">EPU</abbr>), entry number and date, or <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> in the relevant fields and the reason for amendment in the plain text box ‘Receipt of P9’. PARA must be in the box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, pressing the return key should bring the entry data as input onto the screen.</p>

<p>If there’s an expected date of export entered, which is earlier than the amendment, this date should be amended or removed. To achieve an extension in time this data should then be committed to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Where export has actually taken place</h4>

<p>The declarant should confirm that no duplicate set of data has been transmitted. If it has a request for cancellation of the original data (that is under P9 query 0 should be made using <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> format XTCE).</p>

<p>If no duplicate entry has been input the process described above, to extend the life of the data, should be followed. The declarant should then contact customs at the place of export.</p>

<h4>Where goods are not going to be exported</h4>

<p>The declarant should make a request for cancellation of the original data (that is under P9 query) using <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> format XTCE.</p>

<h4>Presentation to Border Force</h4>

<p>In the event of goods being shipped without permission to progress, an application should be made to Border Force at the place of export. Border Force will consider the control aspect and the means by which the arrival message should have been generated, for example inventory, web loader or <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> by customs.</p>

<p>Application to process data that has generated a P9 report for goods that have been shipped without <abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr> must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of the export <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>an export entry reference number, for example <abbr title="Entry Processing Unit">EPU</abbr>-Entry Number-Date</li>
  <li>a letter of explanation (reason for non-arrival to be established by the declarant not customs)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-notification-of-retrospective-arrival-c1603">form C1603</a> detailing the export goods in question and references</li>
  <li>a certified copy of Bill of Landing or Airway Bill</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional papers may be called for at the discretion of the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> where doubts exist over the actual export, ‘arrival’ will not be performed until the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> are fully satisfied that the actual export took place.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> are satisfied that the goods have been shipped, an arrival message of the data/<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> will be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> by them.</p>

<p>Following ‘arrival’, the declarant or the exporter should retain evidence of export for future audits as under no circumstances should a departure message be input. All P9 arrivals will receive an ‘assumed departure’ message instead. These exports will require commercial documentation to support a claim for VAT zero rating or a duty relief.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Transitional arrangements apply - datasets for export declarations will be revised under UCC IT implementation. Any changes to datasets will be put in place once the upgrade from CHIEF to CDS is completed. Current treatment of retrospective export declarations may change under CDS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.12 </span>Merchandise in baggage</h3>

<p>Goods of a commercial or business nature which are exported as accompanied baggage are referred to as ‘merchandise in baggage’ (<abbr title="merchandise in baggage">MIB</abbr>). Passengers leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> with <abbr title="merchandise in baggage">MIB</abbr> are advised to submit an export declaration well before their schedule departure.</p>

<p>In almost all cases declaration should be submitted electronically into <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> by one of the authorised data transmission routes available. A copy of the pre-lodged declaration can then be presented with the goods to the export officer at the port/airport. The declaration must also be accompanied by any other documentation required for the goods, for example an export licence.</p>

<p>Where it has not been possible to input your export declaration to <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> before arriving at the port/airport a completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-european-community-exp-sadsec-c88ess">paper C88/ESS</a> must be presented to the export officer. Customs will key this onto <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Paper declarations C88/ESS declarations are likely to take longer to clear than those submitted directly to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. This may impact on the time of release of any goods.</p>

<p>If in these circumstances you require a certificate of export for VAT purposes you must ensure that copy 3 or <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> is stamped by the export officer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span>Pre-lodgement</h3>

<p>It is a requirement that export declarations are pre-input in advance of shipment. This means that the arrival indicator will always be ‘No’ with subsequent declaration acceptance/arrival being activated by a company with a <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> loader role (arrival notification completed in box 1, second subdivision).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span>Trader identification <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>All exporters and other parties involved in international trade need to quote their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/economic-operator-registration-and-identification-eori-scheme"><abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is a combination of the country code of the issuing country and the identity reference allocated by that country. In the UK traders enter GB followed by the traders <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>.</p>

<p>To apply for <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> registration please email the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>/<abbr title="Trader’s Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr> team in Cardiff <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:turnwhmrc@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">turnwhmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>In the UK the majority of <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> numbers will be based on a 2 digit country code, followed by 12 numeric characters usually comprising of a 9 digit UK VAT number followed by a 3 digit suffix (000) - for example, GB 123 4567 89 000. Traders who are members of a VAT group registration will have a 3 digit suffix which should be used for exports.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Some government departments/agencies have been issued with special registration numbers.
<br><br>
If a UK trader is not registered for VAT they can apply for an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:eori@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk">eori@hmrc.gsi.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Private individuals can use the GBPR indicator where there’s no commercial purpose involved, for example household effects.</p>

<p>Non-UK traders who have an identity issued by another <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country must enter those details.</p>

<p>If a trader has a UK allocated <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>, this must be declared even if the trader also has non UK identities.</p>

<p>For non <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> traders declaring temporary admission goods for re-export who don’t require an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number, enter ‘00500’ in the ID field prefaced by the non <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country code of the exporter followed by their name and address.</p>

<p>Identities should be shown on paper declarations after ‘Number’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.9 </span>Export procedure followed by transit procedure</h3>

<p>All goods for export must obtain customs clearance or ‘Permission to Progress’ (<abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr>) from <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Where goods must remain under customs control on one of the transit procedures, they must subsequently be declared to the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> transit system. CIP 18 (2015) explains the full procedures.</p>

<h4>Free circulation goods in excise duty suspension</h4>

<p>The Excise Movement and Control System (<abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>) is an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>-wide computer system that’s used to record duty suspended movements of excise goods taking place within the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. Where goods are leaving the union the excise movement is entered into the export declaration.</p>

<p><abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> system - an electronic Administrative Document (eAD) is completed on the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr>.  <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> generates the Excise Administrative Reference Code (ARC) number.</p>

<p>Export (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system - an export declaration is completed on the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> system.  Box 29 must be completed to identify the appropriate office of exit.  The ARC number generated by the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> system must be placed in box 40, using Administrative Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Accompanying Administrative Document">AAD</abbr>) in the previous document field.</p>

<p>The Additional Information (<abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr>) code TRANS must be shown in box 44. Where fall-back procedures have been agreed, the fall-back accompanying document (FAD) number must be shown instead in the previous document field.</p>

<p><abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> transit system - a T2 community transit declaration is completed on the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr> of the export declaration is to be included in box 40.</p>

<p>The goods are presented to both the office of export and the transit office of departure in the UK.</p>

<p>A release to both the export and the transit procedures must be obtained before moving the goods.</p>

<p>The goods and Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>) must be presented at each office of transit.</p>

<p>The goods are presented together with the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> at the office of exit and with the <abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr> being presented at the transit office of destination.</p>

<h4>Duty suspended goods (including goods in excise suspension) being re-exported</h4>

<p>Where goods are released for export and are placed under the external transit procedure, the customs office of exit becomes the customs office of departure for the transit operation. The T1 transit procedure provides security for the goods and should not be used in conjunction with the <abbr title="Excise Movement and Control System">EMCS</abbr> system.</p>

<p>Export (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>) system - an export declaration is completed on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span>Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>) and <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part</h3>

<p>Trader reference based <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> are required in the UK. Traders should enter their own declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> numbers into box 44 of the export declaration as these are recognised across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>When printing an Export Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>) the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> number in box 44 should be printed into box 7 of the paper <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> as this satisfies the ‘safety and security’ requirement for a unique trader reference to be provided.</p>

<h4>UK trader generated <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The format of the UKs <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> conforms to a trader reference based <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> structure recommended by the World Customs Organisation (<abbr title="World Customs Organisation">WCO</abbr>).</p>

<p>The format of a UK trader generated <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is year/GB/<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>/ - /reference/, where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>year is the last digit of the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated, for example 3 if allocated in 2013 or 4 for 2014</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> is the identity of the trader as known to customs - in the UK this was formerly the 12 character Trader’s Unique Reference Number (<abbr title="Trader’s Unique Reference Number">TURN</abbr>) but prefixed by GB (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will accept <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> numbers issued in other member states)</li>
  <li>a hyphen (-) and reference are a unique series of characters (up to a maximum of 19), which the trader whose <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> devises and which provides an audit trail within their commercial records - this component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters viz. 0 to 9, A to Z, -, ( and ). Forward slashes (/) and colons (:) must not be used</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> based on the above is 9GB123456789012-ABC1234.</p>

<p>For export declarations, the <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and trader reference are to be incorporated into a UK trader generated <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the consignor/exporter (as declared in box 2) is using simplified procedures (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> or <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr>), or there is no declarant/representative (for example, box 14 is not completed) then the exporters <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and reference is to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If the exporter is not using simplified procedures but the declarant is, then the declarants <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and reference is to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If neither the exporter nor the declarant is using simplified procedures but both have an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number then if the exporter has supplied both an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and a reference then those details are to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>. If the exporter has not supplied a reference then the declarants <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and reference is to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If the declarant has an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number but the exporter is shown as GBPR, then the declarants <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and reference is to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If the declarant is GBPR but the exporter has supplied an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and a reference then the exporters <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number and reference is to be incorporated into the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If the declarant is GBPR and the exporter has supplied an <abbr title="Economic Operator Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number but not a reference leave this field blank. <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will then automatically generate a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If both the exporter and the declarant are GBPR leave this field blank. <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will then automatically generate a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part</h4>

<p>Additionally in the UK, to allow 2 or more declarations to have the same core <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and provide a check letter, a further optional field (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part) of up to 4 characters has been made available. It is this, in combination with the (up to) 35 character <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr>, which must be unique, but if the suffix is not used it can be ignored, there is no need to enter spaces or zeros.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part field can contain an optional up to 3 numeric part number followed by an optional check letter. So this field can be omitted, contain a part number, contain a part number and a check letter or just contain a check letter. If a check letter is supplied then the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and any part number are checked and the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part rejected if found invalid.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> always provides the relevant check letter in any response(s) relating to the declaration.</p>

<p>An example of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix is 789A.</p>

<p>On paper declarations, the Declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> is declared as a header level document in box 44 with the document code 9DCR, for example, 9DCR9GB123456789012-ABC1234. If a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part suffix is also supplied then the suffix is to be prefixed by part%.</p>

<p>An example of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> with a part suffix is 9DCR9GB123456789012-ABC1234 part%789.</p>

<h4>Simplified declaration considerations</h4>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> ensures that the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part is unique for the declaration. The only exception to this rule is where the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part must be quoted on both the initial declaration and the related supplementary declaration. The initial and <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> can have the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part.</p>

<p>If there is more than one <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> for a single initial declaration, then the same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be used for all the supplementary declarations with the part used so each <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> is uniquely identified by a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part.</p>

<p>If there is more than one initial declaration for one <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> then on the <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> enter the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> for the first <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>/<abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> in this field and declare the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part for each of the other <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr>/SDs as a header level document in box 44 with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-certificate-and-authorisation-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">document code 9DCS</a>.</p>

<p>Irrespective of how they are differentiated, the audit trail between the <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr> and <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> must be maintained in the trader’s records and through <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> submissions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.11 </span>Additional information (<abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr>) statement format</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr> Format</h4>

<p>If no additional information text is required declare the 5 character additional information code.</p>

<p>If text is required it must be followed by a hyphen and then the appropriate additional information code.</p>

<p>Where the text has separate components (for example, name, street, city) separate each component with a comma.</p>

<h4>Document format</h4>

<p>The format of a document declaration is [document code]-[status]-[reference] - P = [part]- Q= [ quantity]-[reason], where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a document declaration starts with the appropriate 4 character document code followed by a hyphen and then the document details as required</li>
  <li>declare the status in square brackets ([ ])</li>
  <li>a part needs to be declared (for example, a licence line number) prefix it with P =</li>
  <li>a quantity needs to be declared (for example, for a licence) prefix it with =</li>
  <li>the status requires a reason, enclose the text in quotes (”)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.12 </span>Provision of safety and security details</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> legislation required pre-departure safety and security data provision to be made. The UK has incorporated these additional data items into the full declaration on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> but where a full declaration is not required, an <abbr title="Exit Summary Declaration">EXS</abbr> should be used.</p>

<p>The current UK full declaration already includes most of the pre-departure information but <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has identified a number of additional pre-departure notification items which are required in certain circumstances. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>country of export (box 15a required at all times)</li>
  <li>countries of routing (where known) (ROUTE-CNTRY) at header or item level as appropriate</li>
  <li>the method of payment of the transport charges (TRPTCHGE-MOP)</li>
  <li>for UN defined dangerous goods enter the appropriate UNDG code (UNDG-CODE)</li>
  <li>customs office of exit (box 29 for indirect exports)</li>
  <li>seal number</li>
  <li>goods description - this must be entered in box 31 for IEXS transaction</li>

<p>The consignors/exporters identity and, depending on the circumstances, their name and address is to be provided.</p>

<p>The consignor/exporter can be declared at the header level or for each item.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>The exporter is the person on whose behalf the export declaration is made and who owns the goods or has a similar right of disposal over them at the time when the declaration is accepted.</p>

<p>Where ownership or right of disposal belongs to a person established outside of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, pursuant to the contract on which the export is based, the exporter shall be considered to be the contracting party established in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Commission Regulation 2454/93 Article 788(2)).</p>

<p>For example, the UK seller would be entered as exporter/consignor in respect of ex-works sales and the name and address of the overseas buyer entered as additional information into box 44 of the declaration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-additional-information-codes-for-harmonised-declarations"><abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr> codes under general statements</a>).

<p>This field must be completed.</p>

<p>The goods described in this box must all be subject to the same Binding Tariff Information Reference Number if held for the goods commodity code.</p>

<p>Enter a description of the goods sufficient to identify them. If the goods described here do not comprise the whole contents of a package, enter part case or part container as appropriate. The description of the goods must be the normal trade description expressed in sufficiently precise terms to enable immediate and unambiguous identification and classification. This does not mean copying out the full description as set out in the tariff.</p>

<p>For example, magnesium potassium sulphate (heading 31.04 commodity code 310490000) should be described in those terms and not as other mineral or chemical fertilisers, potassic.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr>, for other than excise goods, if box 33 is completed then an unambiguous description is still needed where the heading is a general catch-all heading. For <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr> and full declarations for excise goods a full description of the goods including the volume, brand name, container sizes and strength etc must always be provided, for example 1000 c/s Old St Andrews golf ball whisky miniatures 12x5cl at 40%, rotn 232/02.</p>

<p>For Exit Summary Declarations, a full and unambiguous goods description must be supplied if a commodity code is not declared.</p>

<p>For goods re-exported from a customs warehouse or exported from an excise warehouse, the relevant stock numbers must be entered. When the goods are exported from an excise warehouse, which has customs approval to load goods into export container(s), the seal number(s) used to secure the container must be entered in box D (see under box 54 below).</p>

<p>Otherwise packages are declared as for export declarations, identify the packaging that holds the packaging that immediately surrounds the goods, the number of individual items packaged, in such a way that they cannot be divided without first undoing the packing, or number of pieces, if unpackaged.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for beer the packaging might be the crate or carton and not the bottle in which the beer is contained or if the goods are contained immediately within cartons contained on a pallet (eg books), the pallet instead should be declared</li>
  <li>for a single consignment in one or a number of containers, the containers themselves can be deemed to be the outer packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>There is only a need to supply the marks and numbers, quantity and container numbers. In effect, in this example, the container number(s) will be the marks need only be entered as container details but with reference to this entered in the marks (for example package kind, CNsee Container Id details entered).</p>

<p>However, where the goods are subject to different duty or VAT rates, for example mixtures of red and white wine or children and adults clothing, the lowest divisible level of packaging must be declared in order to aid identification. So, bottles, wrapping or other packaging will be more appropriate in these examples.</p>

<p>For each kind of package, enter:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any marks and numbers on the packages. Taking into account the packaging examples given above, where there is one common identifying number for all of the packaging then only this number need be entered. If there is insufficient space to record all the information, create another set of package details with the same kind of packages code. On paper declarations precede the marks and numbers by PM%, for example PM%ABC123.</li>
  <li>The quantity of packages, or for unpackaged goods (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-kind-of-packages-codes">UK Trade Tariff: kind of packages codes</a>) the number of pieces.

<p>Since the introduction of <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr>, trader reference based <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr> are required in the UK. It is important that traders enter their own declaration <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> numbers into box 44 as these are recognised across the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and remove the requirement to enter additional references into box 7.</p>

<p>When printing an <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> number in box 44 should be printed into box 7 of the paper <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and the optional part must be unique and must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#exportprocfllwdtrstpro">rules and be in a certain format</a>.</p>

<p>Couriers and fast parcel operators, authorised under the MOU arrangements must supply a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part.</p>

<p>The declaration of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part also enables <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to detect duplicates and so identify potential problems at an early stage.</p>

<p>On supplementary declarations enter the related <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part(s) for the linked <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>(s). If a <abbr title="supplementary declaration">SD</abbr> covers more than one <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr>, use the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> of first <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSA</abbr> as the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Part for the supplementary declaration. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Parts of each of the other <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr> are to be declared as separate 9DCS documents.</p>

<p>A licence is declared as a document with the code given in the above tables for the particular licence type being declared.</p>

<p>A status code and a document reference must always be declared. The document reference is currently required when the status identifies that a particular licence is not to be supplied (X-series status codes). This is to identify the licence type because the document code is not currently sufficient to identify. Other details that can be declared for a document depend on the status and the licence.</p>

<h4>Status code</h4>

<p>Enter the appropriate status code from the table below. The status must be permitted for the licence type and the commodity.</p>

<p>Find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-document-status-codes-for-harmonised-declarations">list of status code definitions.</a></p>

</ul>

<p>In circumstances where some goods covered by the declared commodity code require a licence and others do not (ex-heading), then <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-additional-information-codes-for-harmonised-declarations"><abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr> code LIC99 can be declared instead of the ‘XX’ status</a> when the licence does not apply to the goods.</p>

<h4>Document reference</h4>

<p>Enter the document reference. The document reference for a licence is in the format - ‘country code licence type, licence identifier, country code’.</p>

<p>Do not enter any separator or space between the 3 parts. The licence identifier is not supplied when the status identifies that a particular licence is not being declared.</p>

<p>For all UK government department/agency issued licences/<abbr title="Advance Fixing Certificate">AFCs</abbr>/permits including those which were originally issued in another member state but which were subsequently reissued - including any ‘extracts’ by a UK government department/agency) enter ‘GB’</p>

<p>For licences issued in another member state enter the relevant country code, for example for France enter ‘FR’.</p>

<p>Licence type (as identified above).</p>

<p>Licence identifier - enter the licence identifier allocated by the issuing authority. If the licence does not have a reference, enter the title of the licence. A licence identifier is not supplied when the status identifies that a particular licence is not being declared (for example, status code is in the X-series).</p>

<h4>Part</h4>

<p>Some licences cover many products with each one defined as a line. The document part field is used to identify the line number when required. If omitted, it defaults to 1 and the attribution applies to the first (or only) line of the licence.</p>

<h4>Quantity</h4>

<p>For licences monitored by a quantity enter the quantity in the units specified for the licence (line), for example if the licence (line) is specified in kilograms enter a quantity in (or converted to) kilograms.</p>

<p>For licences monitored by value the value (converted into the relevant currency if necessary) declared in box 46 (statistical value) will be used to attribute the licence.</p>

<h4>Reason</h4>

<p>A reason must be supplied for some status values.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9110– [AE] GBEWP234567 Q%123.456</li>
  <li>X018– [UP] GBCEX “eaten by dog-replacement in the post”</li>

<p>Only completed on paper declarations.</p>

<p>Where the declarant is completing the declaration themselves under ‘self representation’, they shall be liable for the content of all declaration so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>The declaration must be signed according to the following rules. If the consignor is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an individual, by that individual or an employee who has been authorised in writing</li>
  <li>a partnership, by one of the partners, or one of their employees authorised in writing by a partner</li>
  <li>a company incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act, by a director or the secretary, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by a director or the secretary</li>
  <li>a corporation incorporated in the UK by statute, by a person authorised by law to sign for the corporation, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
  <li>a foreign firm or company, or a corporation incorporated abroad by statute, by a person authorised by the law of the country in which the firm or company, is established or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively the declaration may be signed on behalf of the consignor by any firm, company or individual to whom the consignor has given the authority to act as a declarant for customs purposes.</p>

<p>The manner of the authorisation is a matter of arrangement between consignor and their representative but, in giving authority to a representative, the consignor will be assumed to have given authority to the clerks and servants authorised by the representative to carry out all of the consignor’s customs business.</p>

<p>Customs may at any time require evidence that a representative has been authorised by a consignor to sign declarations on the consignor’s behalf.</p>

<p>If the representative is acting under direct representation, enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place at which the declaration was made and the date</li>
  <li>the name of the declarant</li>
  <li>‘pp’ or ‘by’ the name of the representative</li>
  <li>handwritten signature/or approved electronic equivalent of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>full name of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>status of the person completing the form (eg director, clerk)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the representative is acting under indirect representation, enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place at which the declaration was made and the date</li>
  <li>the name of the representative</li>
  <li>the handwritten signature/or approved electronic equivalent of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the full name of the person completing the form</li>
  <li>the status of the person completing the form (eg director, clerk)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Manifests</h2>

<p>After export goods have been loaded the operators of the ship or aircraft (or their agents) as part of the outward clearance arrangements must, on request, provide customs with a list of goods on board the export means of transport. The document listing the loaded goods is termed the manifest. The information that must be shown on the manifest is set out below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Goods exported by ship</h3>

<p>For each consignment, the ship’s manifest must contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name of the consignor, or forwarding agent or shipper</li>
  <li>the marks and numbers of the packages</li>
  <li>the number and type of packages, or quantity for bulk goods</li>
  <li>a description of the goods</li>
  <li>customs status, for example T1 or T2</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally for goods exported in containers, the manifest must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the identify number of the container</li>
  <li>the name(s) of the operator(s) of the container</li>
</ul>

<p>When requested, ship’s manifest must be presented to customs within 14 days of date of departure of the vessel except where local arrangements apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Goods exported by aircraft</h3>

<p>Except the airlines using computerised freight inventory systems approved by customs, aircraft manifests must show, for each consignment, the required particulars on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-cargo-manifest-c257">form C257</a>. The manifest must be presented to customs when applying for outward clearance for the aircraft.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Exports leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state</h2>

<p>Where goods are declared for export in the UK, but leave the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via another member state, a customs <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> must accompany the goods to the office of exit. This is evidence that the consignment has been subject to export control in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> law requires that the export declaration is lodged in the exporter’s member state. Goods arriving at offices of exit in other member states without evidence that the export declaration has been made in the UK are likely to be returned to the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span>Exports by road, via another member state</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> must travel with the goods to the office of exit at the external frontier to prove the goods have been cleared for export in the UK. In certain circumstances a commercial document may be used in place of an <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>. You should check with customs before using a commercial document.</p>

<p>Neither Greece nor the Republic of Ireland will accept commercial documents in lieu of official documents for exports leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via their countries.</p>

<p>Customs at the office of exit will scan the <abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr> barcode on the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> and update <abbr title="Export Control System">ECS</abbr> to close the movement to evidence that the goods have left the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span>Exports under a Single Transport Contract (<abbr title="single transport contract">STC</abbr>) via another member state</h3>

<p>The customs location where goods are exported under a single transport contract is the office of exit. In these circumstances an <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> is not required to travel with the goods. Box 29 of the export declaration should not be completed, but box 44 should include the <abbr title="additional information">AI</abbr> code STC99I.</p>

<p>As stated in paragraph 9.8 <abbr title="single transport contract">STC</abbr> cannot be used for the exportation of excise goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span>Exports from another member state leaving the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> via the UK</h3>

<p>A customs clearance request (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-customs-clearance-request-c21">form C21</a>) using <abbr title="customs procedure code">CPC</abbr> 10 00 043 should be submitted to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Box 40 of the C21 must accurately state the <abbr title="Master Reference Number">MRN</abbr> the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> produced at the office of export in the originating member state. Once clearance by <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> has been obtained the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> should be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Freepost
<br>BT OPS
<br>EAD
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Where goods are travelling by rail, post, air or sea under a <abbr title="single transport contract">STC</abbr> for carriage to a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country the office of exit, formalities will have already been carried out and there will be no <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr>. Instead, the transport document which should have been endorsed ‘export’ and stamped must be presented to customs as evidence that the goods have already been cleared for export in the originating member state.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is where a bilateral agreement has been concluded in respect of the operator. In this case no document is required.</p>

<p>Exports originating in other member states may require a C21 electronic declaration to clear inventory controlled locations. The entry (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-customs-clearance-request-c21">form C21</a>) reference number should be written on the reverse of the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> before it is sent to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Exports not cleared in the exporter’s member state</h4>

<p>Most exports will be cleared in the exporter’s member state. Only where there are ‘duly justified good reasons’ why this was not possible, the export declaration may be made in the UK. Examples of ‘duly justified good reasons’ are change of contract and diversion of goods. Closure of a customs office is not a ‘duly justified good reason’.</p>

<p>Where customs is satisfied that there is a good reason an export declaration should be made in the UK the <abbr title="Export Accompanying Document">EAD</abbr> will be returned to you for forwarding to the exporter in the other member state.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Non availability of computer systems: fallback</h2>

<p>When breaks in connectivity to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> routes occur a decision may be made to revert to manual paper declarations. The procedures adopted are known as ‘fallback’. Development of electronic services means that breaks in transmission are always a possibility, although any planned changes in the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> services will be notified in advance of any downtime via the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Noticeboard and our web pages.</p>

<p>In cases where other routes are likely to be affected, for example <abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr> downtime, <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will need to know, in advance of any changes to these systems. Details should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how much anticipated downtime there will be</li>
  <li>when the system will be fully restored</li>
  <li>what recovery measures will be undertaken should the planned changes fail or be delayed</li>
</ul>

<p>It is therefore important that any extended break in communication or ongoing computer failure is brought to the attention of both customs and traders immediately.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span>Notice to traders</h3>

<p>Messages will be given to the trade to let them know when <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will be unavailable on this website, <abbr title="community system providers">CSP</abbr> lists and the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> helpline in Cardiff. Details will also be given to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise and Customs Helpline</a>.</p>

<p>If a break occurs with one of the routes into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and/or the Government Gateway, customs will first investigate the reason behind the failed connections before considering the adoption of fallback measures.</p>

<p><abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr> have developed their own fallback measures for <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> failure and exporters routing their entries through <abbr title="community system providers">CSPs</abbr> should familiarise themselves with these procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span>What to do when fallback is invoked</h3>

<p>The failure of an electronic route into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> for <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> can cause problems. Irrespective of the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> route into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, the failure of a trader’s chosen route can cause delays. Even though <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> offers a wide variety of access channels, it is not always a viable alternative for some traders to use another route by which to submit their export declarations.</p>

<p>Traders are encouraged to persist in their efforts and keep trying their chosen route. Alternatively, they may opt for one of the other available routes into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> to affect early clearance or make use of a pre-arranged fallback partner if such an arrangement is in place.</p>

<p>Connectivity is normally down for short periods of time only. Therefore it is not practicable to introduce fallback measures, but when directed may use the following fallback procedures.</p>

<p>When it’s confirmed that any of the available routes into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> have been down for at least half a working day (and are expected to be unavailable for the foreseeable future), <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will invoke fallback entry procedures for users of the affected access route only. Fallback will be announced via a number of mediums, including the <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> Notice board, the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> Helpdesk and/or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/excise-enquiries">Excise and Customs Helpline</a>.</p>

<p>Under fallback, declarants will be required to present 3 documents:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-european-community-exp-sadsec-c88ess">form C88/ESS</a> declaration - traders authorised for the <abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr> or <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> will be allowed to submit partially completed C88/ESS forms as <abbr title="pre-shipment advice">PSAs</abbr>.<br>Traders who are not authorised for simplified procedures must complete all the required boxes on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-european-community-exp-sadsec-c88ess">form C88/ESS</a> for a full export declaration.</li>
  <li>This declaration is to be supported with a written undertaking to commit the C88/ESS export declaration electronically, once services resume. This is to be made on a C1402.</li>
  <li>A completed C130EX which customs will authenticate, to indicate that the goods have Permission to Progress, (where such manual releases can be accepted by loaders).</li>
</ol>

<p>Local arrangements may be made in those ports using either CNS or MCP inventory linking for an override mechanism to authorise loading. In these circumstances the load list should be marked for audit purposes post recovery.</p>

<p>For goods shipping via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (indirect exports) any frontier presentation/arrival should be accompanied by either a <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> Copy 3 print or a manual Copy 3. These forms should be headed ‘Fallback’ with a matching <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> or <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> reference in box 44.</p>

<p>Responsibility for lodging these documents with customs and presenting evidence of permission to progress to loaders, remains with the exporter/declarant.</p>

<p>Priority will be given to categories of goods normally recognised as requiring urgent treatment by their nature (for example perishable goods).</p>

<p>Processing of other fallback requests may be subject to availability of resources and Charter Standards timescales.</p>

<p>Although customs will issue manual <abbr title="permission to progress">P2P</abbr> (C130EX) this does not guarantee that export loaders will be able to process and ship the consignments (for example, if their own inventory linked systems are still working). This is a commercial matter outside of customs control.</p>

<p>For exports via CCS-UK airports CNS and MCP ports and other inventory linked environments, there may also be fallback requirement for existing entries to be associated and/or closed by the declarant on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. Where possible, declarants should make arrangements with other trade user to undertake this on their behalf.</p>

<p>In some situations, there may be a need for customs to undertake association of a consignment to a <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr>. Where this occurs the trader is to supply details of the correct <abbr title="Master Unique Consignment Reference">MUCR</abbr> and a list of the individual <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment References">DUCRs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Goods already declared and reported as arrived at a <abbr title="designated export place">DEP</abbr> that still have not received permission to progress, must remain at that location until released by customs. Goods not yet reported to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> at a <abbr title="designated export place">DEP</abbr> can either remain at the <abbr title="designated export place">DEP</abbr> (until the system is available), or be removed and entered at a frontier location. Fallback is not allowed at a <abbr title="designated export places">DEPs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> consignments will be controlled on a local basis, with the option of being declared at a frontier location remaining. If a trader has made a <abbr title="Customs Supervised Exports">CSE</abbr> declaration and undue delays occur <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> staff will be able to release using a C130EX where necessary.</p>

<h4>Additional points</h4>

<p>It’s recommended that traders hold a master copy of forms for instances of fallback.</p>

<p>The only form of <abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr> fallback is by <abbr title="customs input of entries">CIE</abbr> on C88/ESS’s and C88/ESS (<abbr title="Common Agricultural Policy">CAP</abbr>) CIES presented by fax or post to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>.</p>

<p>Association of consignments may be made on behalf of traders by the <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> Helpdesk in Cardiff.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span>Documents to be retained by traders</h3>

<p>Traders using fallback should retain a copy of the C88/ESS and a copy of the C1402 undertaking. On recovery, the information is to be input to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> and if <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> rejects the data the entry may be suitably amended and all the changes notified to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> on the copy of the undertaking.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span>Customs actions during fallback</h3>

<p>Entries submitted during fallback will be face vetted and validated as far as possible by customs. If satisfied the entry will be given a fallback reference number and the undertaking attached to the C88/ESS. The C130EX will be issued showing the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> reference number for control purposes where deemed necessary.</p>

<p>If systems recover before the shipment of goods takes place any <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> entry made will replace the manual clearance previously given. In these circumstances, the C130EX should be retained by the shipper and the entry reference number noted on the form.</p>

<p>After shipment, customs will interrogate the system to ensure that suitable electronic entries have been made. A reasonable amount of time will be given to agents who have <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> entries outstanding. Once the systems recover electronic entries must be made within 7 days. Action will be considered where there is evidence that no <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> declaration has been entered into <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> within this time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span>Uncleared Direct Trader Input (<abbr title="Direct Trader Input">DTI</abbr>) export entries</h3>

<p>There may be occasions where goods are entered to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> exports yet fallback measures are introduced prior to release, for example, examinations. In these circumstances the consignment may be released using a C130EX. The loader should send a ‘goods departed’ message to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> on resumption of the service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.6 </span>Clearance of goods not subject to <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> procedures</h3>

<p>Goods not subject to <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> controls may be released using a C130EX. Traders who use a C21 (<abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> format IECR) for non-<abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> consignments, for example, inventory control purposes, may enter details to <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> (once the system is restored). The use of a C21 (IECR) is not mandatory during fallback for non <abbr title="National Export System">NES</abbr> traffic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>National Clearance Hub (<abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>) interim <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> export fallback arrangements</h2>

<p>This information forms the basis of how the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will deal with <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> outages for exports. It is considered a short term solution in the absence of ‘agreed’ national fallback arrangements.</p>

<p>This will not cover every eventuality and therefore the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> roster duty manager, in conjunction with <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> senior management, will still have the authority to deal with any situation that arises in the most appropriate manner.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.1 </span>Timescales</h3>

<p>All of the procedures listed refer to short term fallback only and will allow for the manual processing of goods during <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> downtime.</p>

<p>Short term fallback is for outages of up to 4 hours only. Any system disruption that continues for over 4 hours will require further detailed arrangements. Long term fallback requires Grade 7 approval or above, and the decision to invoke this will be made by either an <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> or customs senior manager.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span>Exports short term fallback</h3>

<p>For the first 4 hours of any outage the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will only clear entries as follows.</p>

<h4>Under 1 hour</h4>

<p>On presentation of entry paperwork or a completed C1402F fallback request, C130EX manual release note, manual C88/ESS and supporting docs, clearance will be given to life or death consignments only.</p>

<h4>After 2 hours</h4>

<p><abbr title="Memorandum of Understanding">MoU</abbr> operators<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> will be allowed to send goods of a value less than £2,000 and not restricted or covered by a licence.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will not require sight of the paperwork prior to export.</p>

<p>For the port of Dover only after 2 hours the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will liaise with Border Force and put in place a local fallback arrangement which Border Force will manage.</p>

<p>All other exports are to be sent to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> for clearance and will need a completed C1402F fallback request, C130EX manual release note, manual C88/ESS and supporting docs.</p>

<p>Priority will continue to be given to life or death consignments and then to airfreight traffic.</p>

<h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Completion of manual form C88/ESS (<abbr title="Single Administrative Document">SAD</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-european-community-exp-sadsec-c88ess">form C88/ESS</a> can be completed using a computer, typewriter or word processor.</p>

<p>In the top left hand corner of box 2 of the form there is an alignment box. If the first character is typed or printed carefully in that box the form will be correctly aligned for completion by typewriter or word processor.</p>

<p>Completion of the form by hand is acceptable, provided it is legibly printed in ink using block capitals.</p>

<p>There must be no erasures or overwriting on the forms. Alterations must be made by crossing out the incorrect details and, where necessary, adding those required. Alterations made in this way must be initialled by the person making them. Where it is necessary customs will require a fresh declaration.</p>

<p>When continuation sheets are used any ‘description of goods’ boxes, for example box 31 are not completed they must be crossed through.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Supporting documentation requirements</h2>

<p>For certain types of export there is a requirement to produce supporting documentation. There are specific rules for the handling and processing of these documents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.1 </span>Electronic licences</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> has electronic links with the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<abbr title="Department for Business, Innovation and Skills">BIS</abbr>) to process export licences electronically. Details of the licences issue are supplied to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and set up on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will validate the information it receives from the exporter and will reject any entry for which a valid licence is not on file or insufficient. <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> will attribute the licence automatically when the trader inputs the licence type, number, line number, and quantity (as per the licence) and licence status information.</p>

<p>The status flag can be used to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and the issuing authority that the licence is being surrendered or is to be treated as exhausted. Once all outstanding export movements have been completed the licence will be closed. Once the licence is exhausted or expired information about the use of the licence will be sent back to the issuing authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.2 </span>Paper licences</h3>

<p>Where a paper licence is held, the paper licence must be attributed to show the correct amount of goods being declared for export.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Unique Consignment Reference">UCR</abbr> and export declaration reference must be shown on the licence against the amount being written off. Exhausted licences must be sent to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>. On request you must surrender any export licence to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr>.</p>

<p>Paper licences may be issued by other member states for use in another member state. They can include <abbr title="Advance Fixing Certificate">AFCs</abbr> and refund certificates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18.3 </span>Other documents</h3>

<p>There are a number of control documents that will still need to be faxed/supplied with to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> at the pre-shipment stage. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accompanying Administrative Document (<abbr title="Accompanying Administrative Document">AAD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>hazardous waste control document issued by the DEFRA</li>

  <li>preference certificates for authentication and supporting evidence (please note these forms must be authenticated either at the customs office in Salford or with the British Chamber of Commerce)</li>
  <li>INF forms - will need to be endorsed by an officer at the frontier who will either fax a copy of the endorsed INF2 to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> or inform them that this has been done - the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will then clear the goods</li>
  <li>for globalised INF2s, an initial copy should be faxed to the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> - the <abbr title="National Clearance Hub">NCH</abbr> will account for the goods from each separate declaration against the globalised INF2, ensuring there is an adequate quantity available, and then release the goods</li>
  <li>T5s</li>
  <li>export licences (applicable only where the licence is in the form of document)</li>
