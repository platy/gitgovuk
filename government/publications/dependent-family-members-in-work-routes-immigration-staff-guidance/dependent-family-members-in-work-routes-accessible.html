<h3>Version 5.0</h3>

<p>This guidance tells caseworkers how to consider applications from people who wish to enter or remain in the UK as the dependent family member of those who currently have permission on a work route, or who have settled in the UK on a work route.</p>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This guidance tells you how to consider applications from people who wish to enter or stay in the UK as a dependent family member of those who currently have permission on a work route, or who have settled in the UK on such a route.</p>

<p>If the applicant is the dependant of someone who holds or is applying for permission as a student (including Tier 4), they should apply under the Student route.</p>

<p>If the applicant is the dependant of someone who holds or is applying for permission as a graduate, they should apply under the Graduate route.</p>

<p>If the applicant is a dependant of a lead applicant who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is an Irish citizen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>settled via a route not listed below</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has permission in a route not listed below and is not applying to switch into one of those routes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has permission under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) they cannot apply under these routes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a dependant holds valid permission independently of the lead applicant, such as under the EUSS, they may not have to make an application as a dependant under these rules.</p>

<p>This guidance is based on the dependant paragraphs contained in the relevant appendices of the Immigration Rules, the letters in brackets indicate how the Rules are referenced:</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 30 May 2022</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<p>This page tells you about who can apply as dependants on a work route and what their conditions of grant will be.</p>

<h3>Assessing applications for dependent partners and dependent children</h3>

<p>If the dependent partner and/or dependent children are applying at the same time as the lead applicant, the applications should be considered together.</p>

<p>Dependent partners and dependent children are not required to apply at the same time as the lead applicant, they can also apply to join the lead applicant at a later date. If a dependent partner and/or dependent children are applying to join a lead applicant who has already been granted permission to stay within the UK, all dependants should be granted permission in line with the end date of the lead applicantâs permission.</p>

<p>Where a lead applicant qualifies to apply under the âHealth and Care visaâ, their application and those of their dependants will be subject to reduced visa fees and no Immigration Health Charge. In all other respects they should be assessed in line with a Skilled Worker consideration.</p>

<h3>When dependants are permitted</h3>

<p>The following people are allowed to come to the UK as a dependant to join a person who has been granted permission in one of the routes listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark1">about this guidance</a> section, or who will be applying at the same time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>spouses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>civil partners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>partners who are not married or in a civil partnership</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dependent children under the age of 18 on the date of application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Adult children and other relatives</h3>

<p>Children who are 18 years old or older on the date of application, who have not previously been granted permission as a dependent of the lead applicant, cannot be granted permission as a dependent child. Similarly, other relatives, for example parents or grandparents, cannot apply.</p>

<h4>Exceptional dependant applications</h4>

<p>Where there are exceptional, compelling and compassionate circumstances raised on behalf of a dependant who cannot meet the requirements to be granted entry clearance, permission or settlement as a partner or child of a lead applicant, you must consider that application outside of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>See: Leave outside the Immigration Rules for further information.</p>

<h3>Irish citizens</h3>

<p>Irish citizens do not need permission to enter or stay in the UK.</p>

<p>Irish citizens have a right to enter or stay in the UK without restriction and can therefore be the âother parentâ if an economic migrant has a child dependant and the Irish citizen lives with them in the UK.</p>

<p>Note that under some circumstances an Irish citizen could be banned from entering the UK and would therefore not be able be the âother parentâ.</p>

<h3>Children from previous relationships</h3>

<p>The rules of the following routes require that any dependent children are either jointly, with their dependant partner, or solely the responsibility of the lead applicant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Skilled Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovator</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creative Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Religious Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Charity Worker</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following routes allow for the partner to have sole responsibility:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graduate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T2 Minister of Religion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Representative of an Overseas Business</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK Ancestry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global Talent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start-up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Sportsperson</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Agreement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government Authorised Exchange</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global Business Mobility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>High Potential Individual</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scale-up</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of parent under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-introduction">paragraph 6</a> of the Immigration Rules is:</p>

<p>âParentâ includes:</p>

<p>(a) the stepfather of a child whose father is dead, and reference to stepfather includes a relationship arising through civil partnership; and</p>

<p>(b) the stepmother of a child whose mother is dead, and reference to stepmother includes a relationship arising through civil partnership; and</p>

<p>(c) the father, as well as the mother, of an illegitimate child where the person is proved to be the father; and</p>

<p>(d) an adoptive parent, where a child was adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent administrative authority or court in a country whose adoption orders are recognised by the UK or where a child is the subject of a de facto adoption in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 309A (except that an adopted child or a child who is the subject of a de facto adoption may not make an application for leave to enter or remain in order to accompany, join or remain with an adoptive parent under paragraphs 297 to 303); and</p>

<p>(e) in the case of a child born in the UK who is not a British citizen, a person to whom there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility on the ground of the original parentsâ inability to care for the child.</p>

<p>If the child or children come from a previous relationship that the dependent partner has had, and the other natural parent is still alive you should be aware that the lead applicant may have become a de facto adoptive parent.</p>

<p>The Immigration Rules, under paragraph 309A, state that a de facto adoption shall be regarded as having taken place if:</p>

<p>(a) at the time immediately preceding the making of the application for entry clearance under these Rules the adoptive parent or parents have been living abroad (in applications involving two parents both must have lived abroad together) for at least a period of time equal to the first period mentioned in sub- paragraph (b)(i) and must have cared for the child for at least a period of time equal to the second period material in that sub-paragraph; and</p>

<p>(b) during their time abroad, the adoptive parent or parents have:</p>

<p>(i) lived together for a minimum period of 18 months, of which the 12 months immediately preceding the application for entry clearance must have been spent living together with the child; and</p>

<p>(ii) have assumed the role of the childâs parents, since the beginning of the 18 month period, so that there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility.</p>

<p>You should also consider if the circumstances may meet the fourth part of the relationship requirement rules listed below.</p>

<p>â(d) the decision maker is satisfied that there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the parent who is applying for or has entry clearance or permission as a [route name].â</p>

<p>Related rules: CRV 14.2, CW 13.2, GAE 16.2, GT 20.2, HPI 14.2, IA 26.2, SNR</p>

<p>18.2, GTR 18.2, UKX 18.2, SSU 18.2, SEC 16.2, INN 27.2, ROB 24.2, RW 13.2, ISP</p>

<p>24.2, SU 17.2, SW 30.2, UKA 22.2.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to questions such as the list below. This is not an exhaustive list. Any application should have a full consideration of welfare issues and the best interests of the child:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is in the best interests of the child?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are they normally living with the lead applicant and their biological parent who is the partner?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do they have consent from the other natural parent to apply?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a child has previously been granted permission as the dependant of the lead applicant there must be extraordinary circumstances not to grant further permission when assessing the relationship requirement.</p>

<h2>Dependant requirements</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the requirements for dependants of lead applicants.</p>

<p>Dependants must meet the requirements found in each dependant section of the lead applicantâs route â see the appropriate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the dependants of a Skilled Worker must meet the requirements of paragraphs SW 26.1 to SW 46.2.</p>

<h3>Validity requirements â Permission to enter or stay</h3>

<p>Before considering suitability and eligibility, you must check the application is valid.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied the application meets all the validity requirements, you should consider whether to request more information, reject the application or proceed to consider.</p>

<h4>Immigration Health Charge</h4>

<p>For further information on the Immigration Health Charge (sometimes called the Immigration Health Surcharge or IHS), please refer to the guidance on the Immigration Health Charge.</p>

<p>Those applying as dependants of a Health and Care visa applicant or holder are exempt from having to pay the Immigration Health Charge and have lower application fees.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>under 6 years old - photograph only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6 to 16 years old - photograph and fingerprints</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>above 16 years old - photograph, fingerprints and signature</p>

<h4>Switching</h4>

<p>An applicant who is in the UK and applying to switch into the lead applicantâs route as a dependant is unable to do so if they have, or were last granted, permission on any of the routes listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>as a Visitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Short-term student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Parent of a Child Student</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Seasonal Worker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as a Domestic Worker in a Private Household</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Neither can they have been granted permission outside the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>There may be exceptional reasons that someone in those circumstances should be allowed to switch to be a dependant, and this should be considered on a case by case basis outside of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<h4>Lead applicant and partner aged 18 or over</h4>

<p>Lead applicant and partner aged 18 or over:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any application with a partner requires that both the lead applicant and the dependent partner are aged 18 or over when the application is made, with the exception of applications on the UK Ancestry route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK Ancestry applications rely on paragraph 277 of the Immigration Rules, which does not allow a partner permission to enter or stay if either the lead applicant or partner is under 18 on the date of arrival in the UK or on the date on which permission to stay would be granted, rather than the date the application is made</p>

<h3>Suitability requirements â Permission to enter or stay</h3>

<h4>Grounds for refusal</h4>

<p>The applicant must not fall for refusal under the grounds for refusal. The grounds for refusal are divided into 5 sections:</p>

<p>1. Defining which Rules are subject to the grounds for refusal.</p>

<p>2. Grounds for refusal, or cancellation of, entry clearance, permission to enter and permission to stay.</p>

<p>3. Additional grounds for refusal of entry, or cancellation of entry clearance or permission, on arrival in the UK.</p>

<p>4. Additional grounds for refusal, or cancellation, of permission to stay.</p>

<p>5. Additional grounds for cancellation of entry clearance, permission to enter and permission to stay which apply to specified routes.</p>

<p>You should check which rules are appropriate for the type of application you are considering.</p>

<p>You should not take into account any breaches of the Immigration Rules whilst the applicant was under the age of 18 when the offence occurred. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">Overstaying</a>.</p>

<h4>Overstaying and Immigration bail</h4>

<p>Before considering any application, you must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except for periods of overstaying which can be disregarded under the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>Full guidance on overstaying is available.</p>

<p>Additionally, a person applying for permission to stay must not be on immigration bail. A foreign national can apply for immigration bail if the Home Office is holding them on immigration matters. This means they might be released from immigration detention, but they will have to obey at least one condition. These individuals do not hold permission to be in the UK.</p>

<h3>Eligibility requirements â Permission to enter or stay</h3>

<p>Eligibility requirements are divided into the following categories:</p>

<h4>Entry clearance</h4>

<p>A dependant must have been granted entry clearance prior to coming to the UK and will be refused entry if they have not done so, unless they are in the Creative Worker route and meet the requirements below.</p>

<h5>Related rules</h5>

<p>CRV 12.1, CW 11.1, GAE 14.1, GT 18.1, HPI 12.1, IA 24.1, SNR 16.1, GTR 16.1,</p>

<p>A person arriving in the UK and seeking entry as a partner or child on the Creative Worker route who does not have a valid entry clearance may be granted permission to enter if all the following requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is not a visa national</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is seeking entry at the same time as the person they are a dependant of, and who meets the requirements at CRV 3.2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant meets the requirements to be granted permission as a partner or child on the Creative Worker route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the Temporary Work - Creative Worker guidance.</p>

<p>CRV 12.2.</p>

<h4>Tuberculosis screening</h4>

<p>Where an applicant is applying for permission to come to the UK as a dependent partner or dependent child for more than 6 months, they will need to provide a valid Tuberculosis (TB) certificate with their application if they have been residing within a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T</a> of the Immigration Rules for the 6 months immediately before the application. This only applies to entry clearance applications.</p>

<p>Further information regarding which applicants are required to obtain a TB certificate before applying and the valid test centres can be found at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa</a>.</p>

<h4>Lead applicant immigration status</h4>

<p>If the lead applicant has obtained settlement or British citizenship through any route covered by this guidance, a dependent can apply for permission to stay, or settlement if they qualify, as a dependant on the economic route, provided they held permission as the lead applicantâs dependant before the lead applicant settled. This is not a requirement for UK Ancestry applications and does not apply to children born in the UK before the lead applicant settled.</p>

<p>If applying for settlement as the dependant of an International Agreement Worker, T2 Minister of Religion or a Representative of an Overseas Business previous dependant leave must be in that route. Other routes can have been granted as a partner in another route.</p>

<p>It is also open for them to apply as the partner or child of a settled person under the family rules.</p>

<p>If a child was born in the UK and does not hold any immigration status at a time before the lead applicant settled, they can apply for settlement through that economic route â except International Agreement, or T2 Minister of Religion.</p>

<p>A child born after settlement of the lead applicant, and who requires permission to stay, should apply through family routes â paragraphs 297 to 304 in Part 8</p>

<h4>Relationship</h4>

<p>The following requirements should be assessed in the round. Evidence of meeting one requirement will often also show the relationship meets the other requirements. If you doubt the evidence provided to meet any of the relationship requirements, you may request an applicant attends an interview.</p>

<p>Where an applicant fails to undertake an interview without a reasonable explanation as to why they are unable to do so, you must consider whether to refuse the application on grounds for refusal related to the failure to attend the interview (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">paragraph 9.9.1</a>).</p>

<p>The interview can only be rearranged if an applicant gives adequate reasons as to why they cannot attend the interview, and the interview team are reasonably satisfied with these reasons.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance on assessing relationships is available.</p>

<p>Note that this guidance has been written for those assessing applications under Appendix FM, but caseworkers considering applications to which this guidance relates may refer to the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Recognition of marriage and civil partnership</p>

  <li>
    <p>Divorce obtained other than by means of court proceedings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Partner requirements</h4>

<h4>Minimum age for partners</h4>

<p>Any application as a dependent partner requires that both the lead applicant and the partner are aged 18 or over on the date of application (except for UK Ancestry applications, where the relevant date is the date of arrival in the UK or on the date on which permission to stay would be granted).</p>

<p>Only UK Ancestry applications which fail this should reach the eligibility stage. Applications on all other routes should have been rejected as invalid.</p>

<h4>Polygamous relationships</h4>

<p>Applications made by dependent partners who are married to or in a civil partnership with the lead applicant must be refused if that relationship is polygamous and another person already holds permission as the spouse or civil partner of the lead applicant, regardless of whether that relationship has ended.</p>

<p>Applications made on the basis of a dependent child relationship should be refused if the childâs parent is party to a polygamous marriage or civil partnership and any application by that parent would be refused as above.</p>

<h4>Relationship with the lead applicant</h4>

<p>Dependent partners must be able to prove the relationship with the lead applicant, who must hold, or be being granted, permission in the route claimed to enable the dependant partner to apply.</p>

<p>Marriage certificates and Civil Partnership certificates can be used to demonstrate proof of relationship, but other documentation is also acceptable as proof of relationship. This could be, for example, a letter from a registrar or government authority from the country in which the marriage was contracted confirming that it was registered properly.</p>

<p>Where the applicants are unmarried or not in a civil partnership, satisfactory evidence provided to meet the relationship requirements below is likely to also satisfy this requirement.</p>

<p>If a dependent partner has previously been granted permission as a dependant of the lead applicant, they do not need to provide this evidence again.</p>

<p>23.1, SU 16.1, SW 29.1, UKA 21.1.</p>

<h4>Genuine and subsisting requirement</h4>

<p>You must be satisfied the lead applicant and their dependent partner are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.</p>

<p>If the lead applicant and the dependent partner are married or in a civil partnership, acceptable forms of evidence include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a valid document providing record of the marriage or civil partnership such as a marriage or civil partnership certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a valid overseas registration document for a same-sex relationship which is entitled to be treated as a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act of 2004</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where the applicants are unmarried or not in a civil partnership, this requirement should be considered based on the evidence provided to meet the relationship requirements below.</p>

<p>23.3, SU 16.3, SW 29.3, UKA 21.3.</p>

<h4>2- year unmarried partner requirement</h4>

<p>If the lead applicant and the person applying as a dependent partner are not married or in a civil partnership, they can demonstrate their relationship by providing evidence they have lived together for 2 years before the date of application. This can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bank / building society statements, council tax, or utility bills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>residential mortgage statements or tenancy agreements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>official correspondence or documents that link the lead applicant and their partner and show they are living at the same address</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list and other documents can be used to demonstrate a relationship is genuine and subsisting.</p>

<p>The 2-year period of living together for a couple who are not married or in a civil partnership must normally have been completed immediately prior to the date of application.</p>

<p>However, the 2-year period does not have to have been completed immediately preceding the date of application if, for example (this is not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the couple are currently living apart for work reasons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one of the couple needs to attend training in another territory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one partner demonstrates they have significant caring responsibilities,</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>provided that the relationship has existed continuously since the 2-year period of co- habitation and continues to be genuine and subsisting at the date of application.</p>

<p>The applicant must demonstrate that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it was not reasonably possible for the other partner to accompany or join them and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is evidence that the relationship continued throughout that period, for example, by visits, letters, logged phone calls, shared financial accounts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any refusal must be discussed with an Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)/HEO Technical Specialist or a Senior Caseworker to agree that it is not unreasonable.</p>

<h4>Intention to live together</h4>

<p>The lead applicant and the dependent partner must intend to live together throughout their stay in the UK. There should be evidence of a clear commitment from both parties that they will live together in the UK immediately following the outcome of the application in question or as soon as circumstances permit thereafter, and âintends to live togetherâ shall be construed accordingly.</p>

<p>If one party needs to travel for work purposes, this is allowed. You should consider such co-location as reasonable for a genuine and subsisting relationship.</p>

<h4>Child requirements</h4>

<p>You should note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>some requirements apply to all applications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some to those aged under 18 only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some to those aged 16 and over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some to those aged 18 and over</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should ensure the requirements are correctly applied.</p>

<h4>Parental relationship</h4>

<h4>All applicants</h4>

<p>Dependent children must submit evidence they are related to the lead applicant as claimed. This can be evidenced by the childâs birth certificate that shows the name of the child and parents; however, other documentation can also be used to evidence the parental relationship with the child.</p>

<p>Official documents issued by overseas governments may not always be in the same format as a UK birth certificate, but you can accept these if the document has been issued by a government or a court, clearly demonstrates a relationship, and is either in English or Welsh or is accompanied by a certified translation.</p>

<p>Acceptable evidence of a parental relationship for a dependent child can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full birth certificate, which includes the names of both parents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a court order such as a special guardianship order</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a government issued household registration certificate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This doesnât represent an exhaustive list as other forms of documentation can be used to demonstrate the dependent child is a child of the lead applicant or the dependent partner or that the applicant has been appointed as the childâs legal guardian.</p>

<p>There may also be circumstances where the lead applicant is not the natural parent but has assumed the parental role through circumstances such as de facto adoption. See also - <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark12">Children from previous relationships</a>.</p>

<p>You cannot accept an affidavit as these are only evidence someone has made a sworn statement regarding a claimed relationship, and not evidence of that relationship by themselves.</p>

<p>24.1, SU 17.1, SW 30.1, UKA 22.1.</p>

<h4>Parental immigration status requirement</h4>

<p>Both parents of a dependent child applicant must be either applying at the same time as the applicant or have permission to be in the UK (other than as a visitor) unless one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the parent with permission is the sole surviving parent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parent with permission has sole responsibility for the childâs upbringing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parent who does not have permission is a British citizen or a person who has a right to enter or stay in the UK without restriction (and who therefore would not apply for permission) - such persons must, however, be (or will be) ordinarily resident in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you are satisfied there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the parent with permission</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Exceptional circumstances - serious and compelling circumstances</h4>

<p>While you should normally be satisfied that a child is either joining both parents, or the work or study migrant is the sole surviving parent, or has and has had sole responsibility, there may be exceptional cases where it is appropriate to issue entry clearance.</p>

<p>As with all decisions involving children, you must consider the best interests of the child and your safeguarding responsibilities in the spirit of section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, in particular that the parent who is not coming to the UK has given their written permission and that care arrangements are suitable.</p>

<p>The following list is not exhaustive, but are examples of scenarios where it may be judged that there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the parent with permission:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>due to employment or study commitments, one parent is delaying their entry to the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one parent is travelling to a territory for reasonable purposes which makes it impossible to care for the child or children for example the father/mother is travelling to a country where it would not be safe for the child or children to join them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one parent is travelling to a territory for reasonable purposes on a short-term basis such that it would be unreasonable to expect care/schooling arrangements to be made for the short length of the trip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one parent is receiving medical treatment abroad and plans to join the family later</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Child dependant aged 18 or over</h4>

<h4>Previous permission as a dependent child</h4>

<p>A person applying as a dependent child who is aged 18 or over on the date of application must only be granted permission if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they are making an application for permission as a dependant of their parent or parents having last held permission as a dependant of their parent or parents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are not leading an independent life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant is aged 18 or over when they make their first application as the child of the family unit they should be refused.

<h4>Child dependant aged 16 or over</h4>

<h4>Child leading an independent life</h4>

<p>A dependent child aged 16 or over on the date of application must not be leading an independent life. They must still be wholly or mainly financially dependent on the lead applicant or their dependent partner. They cannot be married or in a civil partnership. You should assess all evidence provided with an application to decide if a child is still dependent on their parent or parents.</p>

<p>The following list suggests evidence that could be used to demonstrate the dependent child is living with the lead applicant or their dependent partner and relies on them for financial support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bank or building society statement (which may show funds that their parent is providing to support them)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>credit card bills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>driving licence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NHS registration document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an official letter from their current school, college or university that confirms their address</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<p>If a dependent child pays rent or board, they must evidence the amount they pay each month.</p>

<p>If a dependent child is not living with the family unit due to attending school, college or university, you will need to see further evidence the child is not leading an independent life. If the dependent child is living at a separate address, you must be satisfied this is due to study elsewhere. Evidence of this can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>official confirmation of their studies from their school, college or university</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that they are being financially supported by their parents up to the point they are applying (for example, evidence covering a 3-month period prior to the application)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All arrangements for childrenâs care and accommodation in the UK must comply with relevant UK legislation and regulations.</p>

<p>You must also consider your Section 55 duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children aged under 18.</p>

<h4>Unconnected settlement application</h4>

<p>Any application for settlement as the dependant of a person on the International Agreement route can only be validated if the dependant was previously granted permission as a dependant in the specified route.</p>

<h3>Suitability requirements - Settlement</h3>

<h4>Grounds for refusal</h4>

<p>The applicant must not fall for refusal under the grounds for refusal. The grounds for refusal are divided into 5 sections:</p>

<p>1. Defining which Rules are subject to the grounds for refusal.</p>

<p>2. Grounds for refusal, or cancellation of, entry clearance, permission to enter and permission to stay.</p>

<p>3. Additional grounds for refusal of entry, or cancellation of entry clearance or permission, on arrival in the UK.</p>

<p>4. Additional grounds for refusal, or cancellation, of permission to stay.</p>

<p>5. Additional grounds for cancellation of entry clearance, permission to enter and permission to stay which apply to specified routes.</p>

<p>You should check which Rules are appropriate for the type of application you are considering.</p>

<h4>Overstaying</h4>

<p>Before considering any application, you must check the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except for periods of overstaying which can be disregarded under the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>You should not take into account any breaches of the Immigration Rules whilst the applicant was under the age of 18.</p>

<p>Full guidance on overstaying is available.</p>

<h4>Immigration bail</h4>

<p>A person applying for settlement must not be on immigration bail. A foreign national can apply for immigration bail if the Home Office is holding them on immigration matters. This means they might be released from immigration detention, but they will have to obey at least one condition. These individuals do not hold permission to be in the UK.</p>

<h3>Eligibility requirements - Settlement</h3>

<p>Eligibility requirements for settlement should be considered based on the following:</p>

<h4>Lead applicant settled status requirement</h4>

<p>The lead applicant must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be being granted settlement at the same time as the applicant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have previously been granted settlement while holding permission on the relevant immigration route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have become a British citizen, having previously been granted settlement while holding permission on the relevant immigration route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if lead applicants may have become British citizens without first being granted settlement dependants are allowed to apply in these circumstances, provided the lead applicant had permission on the relevant route at the time they became a British citizen.</p>

<p>GT 27.1, IA 34.1, INN 35.1, MOR 30.1, ROB 33.1, ISP 32.1, SW 39.1, UKA 30.1.</p>

<h4>Last grant settlement requirement</h4>

<p>Unless the applicant is a child who was born in the UK before the lead applicant settled, the dependant must have previously been granted permission as the dependant partner or child of the lead applicant. This permission could be in a different route.</p>

<p>This applies to Global Talent, Innovator, Representative of an Overseas Business, International Sportsperson and Skilled Worker.</p>

<p>Applications under some other routes are subject to a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark56">validity requirement</a> regarding the previous grant of permission.</p>

<h5>Related rules</h5>

<p>GT 27.2, INN 35.2, ROB 33.1A, ISP 32.2, SW 39.2.</p>

<h4>Dependent Partners qualifying period</h4>

<p>Dependent partners of Global Talent, International Agreement Workers, Innovator, T2 Minister of Religion, International Sportsperson and Skilled Worker lead applicants must complete a 5-year qualifying period before they qualify for settlement.</p>

<p>If the lead applicant has settlement on the basis of long residence, including where they have subsequently naturalised as British citizens, their partner cannot extend their permission or gain settlement as a dependant under the routes this guidance relates to and must switch into the partner of a settled person category and apply for permission to stay. For more information see Appendix FM guidance.</p>

<p>Where the lead applicant has been granted British citizenship, their dependants can still apply if they held permission as dependants at the time.</p>

<p>If the lead applicant is being granted settlement in, gained settlement through or has been granted citizenship following, UK Ancestry or Representative of an Overseas Business permission, the dependant may apply for settlement without completing a qualifying period and provided they can switch into the route.</p>

<h4>5-year permission requirement: partners</h4>

<p>Those who are required to complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark64">qualifying period</a> must have spent a continuous period of 5 years in the UK with permission as a dependent partner of the lead applicant.</p>

<p>You must not include any absence from the UK during periods of permission granted under the Immigration Rules in place before 11 January 2018 towards the 180 days allowable absences. For example, if a dependent partnerâs qualifying period includes initial permission granted from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2018, and an extension granted from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2020, you must not count any absences before 1 February 2018.</p>

<h4>Both parentsâ settlement requirement</h4>

<p>In an application to settle as a dependent child, both parents must be either being granted settlement at the same time as the applicant or have previously been granted settlement due to permission in the related immigration route unless one of the following applies:</p>

  <li>
    <p>the parent being granted settlement / with settlement granted due to permission in the related immigration route is the sole surviving parent</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h4>Child dependant aged 18 or over</h4>

<h4>Previous permission as a dependent child</h4>

<p>A person applying as a dependent child who is aged 18 or over on the date of application must only be granted permission if:</p>

<ul>

    <p>they are making an application for permission as a dependant of their parent or parents having last held permission as a dependant of their parent or parents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are not leading an independent life</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant is aged 18 or over when they make their first application as the child of the family unit they should be refused.

<h4>Child dependant aged 16 or over</h4>

<h4>Child leading an independent life</h4>

<p>A dependent child aged 16 or over on the date of application must not be leading an independent life. They must still be wholly or mainly financially dependent on the lead applicant or their dependent partner. They cannot be married or in a civil partnership. You should assess all evidence provided with an application to decide if a child is still dependent on their parent or parents.</p>

<p>The following list suggests evidence that could be used to demonstrate the dependent child is living with the lead applicant or their dependent partner and relies on them for financial support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>bank or building society statement (which may show funds that their parent is providing to support them)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>credit card bills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>driving licence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NHS registration document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an official letter from their current school, college or university that confirms their address</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list.</p>

<p>If a dependent child pays rent or board, they must evidence the amount they pay each month.</p>

<p>If a dependent child is not living with the family unit due to attending school, college or university, you will need to see further evidence the child is not leading an independent life. If the dependent child is living at a separate address, you must be satisfied this is due to study elsewhere. Evidence of this can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>official confirmation of their studies from their school, college or university</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence that they are being financially supported by their parents up to the point they are applying (for example, evidence covering a 3-month period prior to the application)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Care requirement</h4>

<p>You must be satisfied the applicant will be living with the lead applicant and any dependent partner in a suitable care arrangement that meets relevant UK legislation, unless they are aged 18 or over.</p>

<p>All arrangements for childrenâs care and accommodation in the UK must comply with relevant UK legislation and regulations.</p>

<p>You must also consider your Section 55 duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children aged under 18.</p>
