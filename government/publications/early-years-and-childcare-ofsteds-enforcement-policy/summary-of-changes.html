<h2>March 2022</h2>

<p>Reviewed throughout and published in HTML for accessibility. Some information about our internal procedures has been moved to internal-only guidance.</p>

<p>New sections added: ‘CCTV’, ‘Childminder agencies’, ‘Data protection’ and a new Annex B listing criminal offences.</p>

<h3>Sections updated</h3>

<p>‘Refusing a registration’ section: clarified the process if a provider resigns before we issue a NOI to refuse a registration.</p>

<p>‘Applying to waive disqualification’:  clarified that we consider a waiver application before, and separately from, any application to register.</p>

<p>‘How we act on information’: explained how we may share information about registered providers and other individuals with other agencies.</p>

<p>‘Notifications to Ofsted’ – this is now in Annex A and we have added details of how to notify us in each scenario.</p>

<p>‘Ofsted’s role at local authority strategy meetings’: clarified our role in strategy meetings.</p>

<p>‘Regulatory activity and inspections’: listed the ways we may respond to concerns.</p>

<p>‘Making the decision to cancel a provider’s registration (Early Years Register)’: clarified that if we have judged a provider as inadequate at 2 consecutive inspections and there is no improvement, we would usually take steps to cancel their registration.</p>

<p>‘Welfare requirements notices’: clarified how we check compliance with these.</p>

<p>‘Raising an action’: clarified that providers that are set actions must notify us within the specified timescale about the action that they have taken.</p>

<p>‘Suspending a registration’: explained how we serve the notice and what information providers should share with us.</p>

<p>‘Voluntary removal/resignation’: explained that if a provider resigns when we have concerns about them, we will record our concerns and may consider them further if the applicant applies to register in the future.</p>

<p>The ‘Prosecution’ section has been reviewed and updated throughout.</p>

<p>‘Referrals to the DBS’: Added more information about the ‘harm test’ and when we can refer individuals to the DBS.</p>
