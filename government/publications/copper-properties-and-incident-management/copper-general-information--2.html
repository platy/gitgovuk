<p>Copper is a reddish-brown metal that is present in the earth’s crust.</p>

<h2>Uses of copper</h2>

<p>Copper is an essential element for all living organisms, hence small amounts are needed in the body. Due to the heat and electrical conductivity of copper, as well as its resistance to corrosion,&nbsp;ductility,&nbsp;and malleability, it has many industrial applications and is widely used in electrical wiring, switches, electroplating, plumbing pipes, coins, metal alloys and fireworks. In addition, it is used in the production of pesticides, ceramics and glass, paints and pigments, and coinage.</p>

<h2>How copper gets into the environment</h2>

<p>Copper can be released into the environment from natural sources such as volcanoes, forest fires,&nbsp;dust&nbsp;and rotting vegetation. It can also enter the environment when copper is mined and from industries that make or use copper compounds as well as from waste dumps,&nbsp;waste water&nbsp;and the burning of fossil fuels and wood.</p>

<h2>Exposure to copper</h2>

<p>As copper is naturally present in the environment, sources of exposure include breathing air, dust, supplements, and soil. The general population is primarily exposed to copper via food and drinking water.</p>

<p>Exposure to copper can also occur during mining and industrial use of copper.</p>

<h2>How exposure to copper can affect your health</h2>

<p>The presence of copper in the environment does not always lead to exposure. For it to cause any adverse health effects, you must&nbsp;come into contact with&nbsp;it. You may be exposed by breathing or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. Following exposure to any chemical, the adverse health effects encountered depend on several factors, including the amount to which you are exposed (dose), the way you are exposed, the duration of exposure, the form of the chemical and if you were exposed to any other chemicals you are exposed to at the same time.</p>

<p>Breathing fumes of copper can lead to metal fume fever, which is characterised by symptoms such as fever,&nbsp;headache&nbsp;and tiredness, as well as cough, sore throat, tightening of the chest. Sometimes a metallic taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting and blurred vision can occur.</p>

<p>Eating foods or drinking water containing high levels of copper can cause stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Symptoms usually resolve once the exposure stops.</p>

<p>Exposure to copper contaminated water can cause blue or green discolouration of the skin and hair. Skin and eye irritation can also occur.</p>

<h2>Copper and cancer</h2>

<p>There is very limited data available on whether copper can cause cancer in humans. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.</p>

<h2>Vulnerable people</h2>

<p>Individuals suffering from the rare condition Wilson’s disease are likely to be more susceptible to copper toxicity. Copper builds up in the liver and other organs of people with Wilson’s disease. Over time this can cause liver disease.</p>

<p>People with long-term liver disease may be more sensitive to the effects of copper.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy and the unborn child</h2>

<p>There is limited data available on the effects of copper during pregnancy and whether it causes harm to the unborn child. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>Exposure to high levels of copper will result in the same effects in both adults and&nbsp;children. Effects may be more severe in children.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are exposed to copper</h2>

<p>It is very unlikely that the general population will be exposed to a level of copper high enough to cause adverse health effects. Low-level exposure from the correct use of products that contain copper would not be expected to cause any adverse health effects.</p>

<p>If you have any health concerns regarding exposure to copper, seek guidance from your GP or contact NHS 111.</p>
