<p>On 1 October the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-health-security-agency-to-lead-response-to-future-health-threats" class="govuk-link">came into being</a> as a result of an act of parliament (Health Security (EU Exit) Regulations 2021). <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is an executive agency within the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and it combines many of the health protection activities previously undertaken by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) together with all of the activities of the NHS Test and Trace Programme and the Joint Biosecurity Centre (<abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>).  The processing activities and the data processors have not changed. Individual rights are not affected by this change.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is responsible for planning, preventing and responding to external health threats, and providing intellectual, scientific and operational leadership at national and local level, as well as on the global stage. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will ensure the nation can respond quickly and at greater scale to deal with pandemics and future threats.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document provides an overview of how personal information about you and others is collected, used, shared, stored, and disposed of in the provision of the response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by NHS Test and Trace programme, which is now a part of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. It also explains your rights and how they can be exercised.</p>

<p>This programme has the following components:</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Testing identifies who has COVID-19, and who has had COVID-19. The detailed privacy notice for testing can be accessed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-privacy-information" class="govuk-link">Testing privacy notice</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tracing</h3>

<p>Tracing identifies people who have or may have been exposed to COVID-19 through contact with people who have tested positive, to advise them to self-isolate, how to obtain support whilst self-isolating  and how to ensure they comply with self-isolation requirements. The detailed privacy notices for tracing and the NHS COVID-19 mobile application can be accessed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://contact-tracing.phe.gov.uk/help/privacy-notice" rel="external">NHS contact tracing service privacy notice</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-app-privacy-information/nhs-test-and-trace-app-early-adopter-trial-august-2020-privacy-notice" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Contain</h3>

<p>Contain works with local authorities to identify clusters and outbreaks of COVID-19, to take coordinated action to deal with outbreaks, and to support local communities in preventing future outbreaks. The contain division has no privacy notice of its own as all the required information is outlined in the testing and tracing privacy notices.</p>

<h3>Joint Biosecurity Centre (<abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr> is integrated into <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and forms part of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It operates as a central analysis and insight function and contributes to national and local decision making.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr> brings together data science, data assessment and public health expertise to provide analysis and insight on COVID-19 in the UK. It does not collect personal information directly from individuals but instead draws upon data from a range of health and non-health sources, as well as other information feeds. This data is then analysed to advise the chief medical officers on the COVID-19 pandemic, including in relation to the alert levels for all 4 nations of the UK. The information is also used to develop insight to complement and build on this data to assist local decision-makers in taking effective action to protect public health.</p>

<p>The data processed includes personal and special category personal information. We recognise that the use and disclosure of personal and special category personal information has implications both for us and for the individuals whose personal information we process.</p>

<p>There is no separate privacy notice for these activities as all the required information is outlined in both this overarching notice and the respective testing and tracing privacy notices.</p>

<h2>Data controller</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has commissioned <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> on behalf of the UK government and will be the data controller for the purposes of data protection legislation. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> decides what information is required and how it needs to be used.</p>

<p>If you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, further information about your governments work to tackle the pandemic can be found here:</p>

Our lawful basis for doing this is section 2A of the NHS Act 2006. Suitable measures to safeguard your rights, freedoms and interests have all been put in place as required by Article 22 of the UK <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Appendix 2: lawful basis for processing</h2>

<h3>Sharing of personal information</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> (formerly Test and Trace, <abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) relies on section 2A of the NHS Act 2006 for the processing of personal information.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State used these powers to amend the Control of Patient Information (<abbr title="Control of Patient Information">COPI</abbr>) notice to allow the sharing of confidential personal information between eligible permitted organisations which are outlined in the <abbr title="Control of Patient Information">COPI</abbr> notice.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Control of Patient Information">COPI</abbr> notice</h3>

<p>The Secretary of State issued the <abbr title="Control of Patient Information">COPI</abbr> notice, on 20 March 2020 (under Regulation 3(4) of the Health Service Control of Patient Information Regulations 2002).</p>

<p>This notice was amended on 29th July and re-issued to protect public health as required under section 2A (1) of the NHS Act 2006 to extend the notice to the end of March 2021. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> delivers the statutory obligations under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to establish and operate the function as per the Secretary of State’s direction to protect public health.</p>
