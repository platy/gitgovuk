<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance contains information for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>members of the public who identify a death outside of a healthcare setting</li>
  <li>first responders managing a death in the community</li>
  <li>general practitioners (GPs) managing a death outside of a healthcare setting</li>
  <li>staff in adult social care and residential settings including care homes and hospices</li>
  <li>funeral directors and others managing a death in the community</li>
  <li>staff and appropriately trained volunteers<sup>†</sup> who manage deceased people suspected or confirmed as infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) including:
    <ul>
      <li>coroners</li>
      <li>mortuary operators</li>
      <li>pathologists and anatomical pathology technologists</li>
      <li>medical practitioners</li>
      <li>funeral directors and embalmers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>those who are participating in or supporting faith and belief practices that involve close contact with the deceased</li>
  <li>those involved in the transport of the deceased</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>† In some communities, deceased bodies are cared for by appropriately trained volunteers. If you are a volunteer with an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19, you should consider seeking advice from your health professional on whether you should provide care for the deceased.</p>
</div>

<p>Where there has been a death in secondary care, healthcare workers should follow the recommendations in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: infection prevention and control (IPC)</a>.</p>

<h2>Main messages</h2>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail. The guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation as required.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed for people who may be involved in managing the body of a deceased person during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes deaths where COVID-19 infection was present.</p>

<p>It has been developed to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the deceased are treated with sensitivity, dignity and respect</li>
  <li>people who come into contact with the deceased or who work in services providing care for the deceased are protected from infection</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic" class="govuk-link">funerals or commemorative events in England during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p>

<p>There are still cases of COVID-19 in England and there is a risk you could catch or pass on the virus, even if you are fully vaccinated. While no situation is risk free, there are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">actions we can take to protect ourselves and others</a> around us. Those who come into close contact (less than 2 metres) with the deceased should assume that COVID-19 infection may be present and take account of the precautions described in this guidance.</p>

<p>Those handling bodies of the deceased should be aware that there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from body fluids and tissues where COVID-19 infection is suspected or confirmed. Although the risk of infectious transmission is lower than for living patients, action should be taken to mitigate that risk. Standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>) and transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr>) should be used to ensure safe ways of working when handling the deceased, these include additional precautions for aerosol-generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol-generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where alternative causes of death are clearly known and features are solely consistent with that known cause, care of the deceased should follow usual management practices.</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) guidance: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm" rel="external">Managing infection risks when handling the deceased</a>, which, whilst not specific to COVID-19, details the standard infection control precautions and transmission-based precautions that should be followed by all those handling the deceased</li>
  <li>Royal College of Pathologists (<abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr>) and Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology (<abbr title="Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology">AAPT</abbr>) guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rcpath.org/uploads/assets/0b7d77fa-b385-4c60-b47dde930477494b/G200-TBPs-Guidance-for-care-of-deceased-during-COVID-19-pandemic.pdf" rel="external">Transmission-based precautions: Guidance for care of deceased during COVID-19 pandemic</a>, which details the Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) required for <abbr title="transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> that should be used by any professional involved in the care of the deceased during the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance has been developed in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive, the advisory group for the management of the deceased (Deceased Management Advisory Group), which represents the funeral, cremation and burial sector and representatives of faith communities.</p>

<h2>Sharing information</h2>

<p>It is critical that all clinical and non-clinical professionals handling the deceased are informed if the deceased presents an infection hazard so that they follow the appropriate infection control guidance, particularly with regard to <abbr title="aerosol-generating procedures">AGPs</abbr> which may be undertaken by a funeral director and others.</p>

<p>This information must be handled sensitively and shared only with those who need it to carry out an appropriate risk assessment and to enable appropriate precautions to be taken. While it is not essential to provide the specific details of the infectious agent, the information should include the detail of likely routes of transmission to ensure that adequate precautions may be taken.</p>

<p>This approach is supported by General Medical Council (<abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr>) guidance on <a href="https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/confidentiality/managing-and-protecting-personal-information#paragraph-134" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Managing and protecting personal information</a> which states that ‘disclosure is justified in the public interest to protect others from a risk of death or serious harm’.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance</a> also advises that where there is a known or suspected risk of infection, sufficient information must be provided to enable people handling the deceased to supplement the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> with appropriate additional precautions to minimise exposure.</p>

<h2>Members of the public who identify a death outside of a healthcare setting</h2>

<p>If you are a member of the public or a family member and you come into contact with a person who has died, including a loved one, please follow this advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>try not to touch the deceased person</li>
  <li>if there has been contact with the deceased, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds</li>
  <li>move to at least 2 metres away or to another room, in order to be able to maintain a distance from the deceased</li>
  <li>if indoors, let fresh air in by opening windows if possible</li>
  <li>call the deceased person’s GP (if the GP is not available you will be connected to the out of hours service) or call NHS 111 for further advice</li>
  <li>if the death was unexpected and you have not been engaging with the healthcare system regarding the patient’s condition prior to the death, please call 999 and explain the situation</li>
  <li>use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance on cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a> for managing the deceased’s laundry and waste</li>
</ul>

<h2>First responders managing a death in the community</h2>

<p>If you are responding to a 999 call-out and are entering a home to assess whether a death has occurred, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on entry to the home, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>advise others not to enter the room in order to maintain at least 2 metres distance from the deceased</li>
  <li>stay at least 2 metres away from other household members, who may be in their self-isolation or quarantine period</li>
  <li>if indoors, let fresh air in by opening windows if possible</li>
  <li>wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as indicated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders">COVID-19: guidance for first responders</a> if you are required to assess for signs of life</li>
</ul>

<p>Among first responders, ambulance staff and paramedics have different requirements for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as they may be required to perform <abbr title="aerosol-generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>. Additional specific <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-ambulance-trusts/covid-19-guidance-for-ambulance-trusts#personal-protective-equipment">guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is available for ambulance staff and paramedics</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-verification-of-death-in-times-of-emergency/coronavirus-covid-19-verifying-death-in-times-of-emergency" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19): verifying death in times of emergency</a>.</p>

<p>You should notify those who are handling the deceased when a death is either suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 related. Sharing this information will enable correct management of the infection risk.</p>

<h2>GPs managing a death outside of a healthcare setting</h2>

<p>If you are a GP and are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-verification-of-death-in-times-of-emergency">verifying death</a> and/or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-notes-for-completing-a-medical-certificate-of-cause-of-death">certifying the cause of death</a> of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outside a healthcare setting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on entry to the home, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>stay at least 2 metres away from other household members, who may be in their self-isolation or quarantine period</li>
  <li>advise others not to enter the room in order to maintain at least 2 metres distance from the deceased</li>
  <li>if indoors, let fresh air in by opening windows if possible</li>
  <li>wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as indicated in <a href="#Table2" class="govuk-link">Table 2. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements for care of the deceased in non-clinical settings</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>GPs should notify those who are handling the deceased when a death is suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 related as required. This information will enable correct management of the infection risk.</p>

<h2>Staff in adult social care and residential care settings including care homes and hospices</h2>

<p>If a resident or client dies with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in an adult social care or residential care setting where you are a member of staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that all residents maintain a distance of at least 2 metres or are in another room from the deceased person</li>
  <li>avoid all non-essential contact with the deceased to minimise risk of exposure</li>
  <li>if you need to provide care for the deceased, this should be kept to a minimum and correct <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used as indicated in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to work safely in care homes</a>
</li>
  <li>you should follow the usual processes for dealing with a death in your setting, ensuring that infection prevention and control measures are implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>You should notify those who are handling the deceased when a death is either suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 related. Sharing this information will enable correct management of the infection risk.</p>

<h2>Funeral directors managing a death in the community</h2>

<p>Funeral directors, in addition to faith and belief representatives, will often be the primary support to households in the immediate period after a death, including attending the home to collect and transfer the deceased. Where possible, support and advice should be provided over the phone. If you are required to meet with the bereaved but will not make direct contact with the deceased, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain a safe distance (at least 2 metres) from the bereaved and other members of the household, who may be in their self-isolation or quarantine period</li>
  <li>wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds on entry to the home and again when leaving the property – where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
  <li>wear a face covering, as is expected and recommended in crowded and enclosed spaces. It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and before and after taking them off. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Please see further detail in guidance on when and where to wear face coverings</a>
</li>
  <li>ask if windows and/or vents may be opened to ventilate the room</li>
</ul>

<p>This advice should be followed for all deaths in the community, including if someone in the household is symptomatic or self-isolating, or if the household is isolating.</p>

<p>If you are required to have close contact with the deceased, for example, to move them, the following precautions should be taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table2">Table 2</a>
</li>
  <li>to be able to maintain 2 metres distance from the deceased person, and other household members if they are self-isolating or in quarantine, household members should be asked to leave the room containing the deceased, including any room that the deceased will travel through as they are moved from the premises</li>
  <li>placing a barrier, such as a cloth or mask, over the mouth of the deceased when moving them may prevent the release of droplets from the respiratory tract</li>
  <li>body bags are not essential although it is recognised that they are used routinely, as part of usual safe ways of working, to prevent leakage affecting the immediate environment and to help maintain dignity, including during repeated movement</li>
  <li>body bags are recommended where capacity in the usual management processes for the deceased is exceeded and management and/or transport of the deceased is being undertaken by individuals who may not be familiar with safe ways of working and appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>cloth wrappings (shrouds or wraps) and coffins may be used to manage the risk of contact transmission but are not a replacement for body bags in situations where they are recommended</li>
  <li>wipe down the external surface of the body bag or coffin with a combined detergent disinfectant solution as normally used within mortuary practice. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dilution, combination, application and contact times for all detergents and disinfectants</li>
  <li>if body bags are used for cremation, they must not contain any PVC or any highly chlorinated materials</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">guidance for people with symptoms of COVID-19, or who have tested positive, and their households</a>. There is additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">guidance for people who have been identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>Guidance for staff who manage the deceased</h2>

<p>This includes mortuary staff, pathologists, anatomical pathology technologists, funeral directors and embalmers and appropriately trained volunteers.</p>

<p>Any member of staff who develops symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should be sent home immediately and advised to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a>.</p>

<p>If the member of staff lives in a household where someone else has symptoms of COVID-19, or has tested positive for COVID-19, they should also follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a>.</p>

<p>Any member of staff who is a recent close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">guidance for contacts of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person</a>.</p>

<p>If you are working with the deceased, including in temporary mortuaries, you should follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Following a risk assessment of potential post-mortem risk pathways, Public Health England developed this guidance with specific reference to the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> set out in the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm" rel="external">managing infection risks when handling the deceased</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance provides advice on the risks of infection from work activities involved with handling the deceased. It also provides guidance for those involved in funeral services, including embalmers, and those involved in the exhumation of human remains.</p>

<p>It covers the safe handling, storage and examination of bodies in hospitals, mortuaries and post-mortem rooms.  <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance is not specific to COVID-19 but the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> described are sufficient for managing the risk with additional precautions taken for <abbr title="aerosol-generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Characteristics of the virus that causes COVID-19</h4>

<p>The exact duration that SARS-CoV2 virus (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) can remain infectious in body fluids and tissues in a deceased body is unknown and will depend on several factors. Residual hazard of infection from COVID-19 may arise from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>droplet generation emanating from the deceased during their care</li>
  <li>post-mortem examination or implant removal involving the use of power tools, which is a risk for aerosol generation</li>
  <li>direct contact with contaminated material such as soiled clothing or bedding from the deceased and the surrounding environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Placing a barrier, such as a cloth or mask, over the mouth of the deceased when moving them may prevent the release of droplets from the respiratory tract.</p>

<p>Other than circumstances where body bags are recommended, their use is not essential and, the deceased may be wrapped in cloth or a shroud to manage the risk of contact transmission.</p>

<p>Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV2 virus can be present for up to 72 hours on some types of environmental surfaces. Other human coronaviruses have been identified on environmental surfaces for up to 9 days so as a precaution, the principles of <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="transmission-based precautions">TBPs</abbr> should continue to apply while deceased individuals remain in the care environment even if beyond 72 hours.</p>

<p>There are currently no reliable data on how long the virus can persist on the deceased under refrigeration conditions. Refrigeration should still be used, and the deceased should be considered a potential source of infection while they remain in the care environment whether refrigerated or not. The appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn when handling the deceased (see <a href="#Table1" class="govuk-link">Table 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table2">Table 2</a>).</p>

<h4>Preparations and final disposition</h4>

<p>Viewing, hygienic preparations such as washing and post-mortem investigations are permitted when overseen or undertaken by those trained in handling bodies of the deceased.</p>

<p>Embalming can take place when necessary, with appropriate consideration of procedures which may generate aerosols. Cremation is permitted and where the deceased has a medical device that requires removal prior to cremation, this should be done using <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of medical device removal will require droplet precautions only (for example, pacemakers and intrathecal pumps). Where there is the potential for aerosol generation through the use of high-speed tools or the removal of fixion nails, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used as indicated in the <abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr> and <abbr title="Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology">AAPT</abbr> guidance for autopsy procedures in <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.rcpath.org/uploads/assets/0b7d77fa-b385-4c60-b47dde930477494b/G200-TBPs-Guidance-for-care-of-deceased-during-COVID-19-pandemic.pdf">Transmission-based precautions: Guidance for care of deceased during COVID-19 pandemic</a> and as described in the second column of <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>*The outside of the body bag or coffin should be wiped down with a combined detergent disinfectant solution as normally used within mortuary practice. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dilution, combination, application and contact times for all detergents and disinfectants.</p>

<p>**Eye and face protection is recommended only if there is an anticipated/likely risk of contamination with splashes or droplets of blood or body fluids.</p>

<h2>Hygienic preparations, faith and belief practices and final disposition</h2>

<p>For those for whom care of the deceased is part of their faith, rituals such as viewing, keeping watch and hygienic preparations such as washing are an important part of the mourning process.</p>

<p>Where such practices involve close contact with the deceased, those handling the deceased should be aware that in cases where COVID-19 infection has been identified or is suspected, there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from body fluids and tissues.</p>

<p>We strongly advise that any rituals or practices that bring people into close contact with the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be undertaken using appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#Table2">Table 2</a>), under supervision of somebody trained in its use.</p>

<p>Individuals with an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness if they were infected with COVID-19 should consider seeking advice from their health professional before having contact with the deceased.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic">Guidance for funerals and commemorative events during the coronavirus</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Transporting the deceased</h2>

<p>Despite the additional precautions required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, every effort should be made to treat the deceased with sensitivity, dignity and respect.</p>

<p>Other than circumstances where body bags are recommended, their use is not essential. Cloth wrappings (shrouds or wraps) and coffins may also be used to manage the risk of contact transmission but are not a replacement for body bags in situations where they are recommended.</p>

<p>If neither body bag nor coffin has been used, cleaning of the vehicle should be in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings outside the home</a>.</p>

<h2>Associated legislation</h2>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature and that an employer should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.</p>

<p>In the event of any conflict between this guidance and any applicable legislation, the applicable legislation will prevail.</p>
