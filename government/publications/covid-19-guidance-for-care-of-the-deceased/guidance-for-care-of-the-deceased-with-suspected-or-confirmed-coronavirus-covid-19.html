<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance contains information for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first responders managing a death in the community</li>
  <li>general practitioners (<abbr title="general practitioners (family doctors)">GPs</abbr>) managing a death outside of a healthcare setting</li>
  <li>those who are managing a death in secondary care</li>
  <li>staff in residential care settings including care homes and hospices</li>
  <li>funeral directors and others managing a death in the community</li>
  <li>staff and appropriately trained volunteers* who manage deceased people suspected or confirmed as infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) including:
    <ul>
      <li>coroners</li>
      <li>mortuary operators</li>
      <li>pathologists and anatomical pathology technologists</li>
      <li>medical practitioners</li>
      <li>funeral directors and embalmers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>those who are participating in or supporting faith and belief practices that involve close contact with the deceased</li>
  <li>those involved in the transport of the deceased</li>
</ul>

<p>*In some communities, deceased bodies are cared for by appropriately trained volunteers. If you are a volunteer who is <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/whos-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">clinically vulnerable</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">clinically extremely vulnerable</a> you are advised not to provide care for the deceased.</p>

<h2>What you need to know</h2>

<p>This guidance is of a general nature and should be treated as a guide. In the event of conflict between any applicable legislation (including the health and safety legislation) and this guidance, the applicable legislation shall prevail. The guidance remains under review and may be updated in line with the changing situation as required.</p>

<p>This guidance is designed for people who are required to manage the body of the deceased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes deaths where COVID-19 infection was present.</p>

<p>It has been developed to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the deceased are treated with sensitivity, dignity and respect</li>
  <li>people who need to come into contact with the deceased or who work in services providing care for the deceased are protected from infection</li>
</ul>

<p>There is separate guidance for funeral directors and others on <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.dmag2020.org/important-updated-guidance-covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2/" rel="external">managing a funeral in England during the coronavirus pandemic</a> and for members of the public on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic">arranging or attending a funeral</a>.</p>

<p>We are currently in a period of widespread community transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Where alternative causes of death are clearly known and features are solely consistent with that known cause, care of the deceased should follow usual management practices.</p>

<p>Where it is not possible to determine if COVID-19 is suspected, those who come into close contact (less than 2 metres) with the deceased should assume that COVID-19 infection may be present and take account of the precautions described in this guidance.</p>

<p>Those handling bodies should be aware that there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from body fluids and tissues where COVID-19 infection is suspected or confirmed. Although the risk of infectious transmission is lower than for living patients, action should be taken to mitigate that risk. Standard infection control precautions (<abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr>) and transmission-based precautions (<abbr title="Transmission-Based Precautions">TBPs</abbr>) should be used to ensure safe ways of working when handling the deceased, these include additional precautions for aerosol-generating procedures (<abbr title="Aerosol Generating Procedures">AGPs</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance should be read in conjunction with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) guidance: <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm">Managing infection risks when handling the deceased</a>, which, whilst not specific to COVID-19, details the standard infection control precautions and transmission-based precautions that should be followed by all those handling the deceased</li>
  <li>Royal College of Pathologists (<abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr>) and Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology (<abbr title="Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology">AAPT</abbr>) guidance <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.rcpath.org/uploads/assets/0b7d77fa-b385-4c60-b47dde930477494b/G200-TBPs-Guidance-for-care-of-deceased-during-COVID-19-pandemic.pdf">Transmission-based precautions: Guidance for care of deceased during COVID-19 pandemic</a>, which details the Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>) required for <abbr title="Transmission-Based Precautions">TBPs</abbr> that should be used by any professional involved in the care of the deceased during the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance has been developed in consultation with the Health and Safety Executive, the advisory group for the management of the deceased (Deceased Management Advisory Group), which represents the funeral, cremation and burial sector and representatives of faith communities.</p>

<h2>Sharing information</h2>

<p>It is critical that non-clinical professionals handling the deceased are informed if the deceased presents an infection hazard so that they follow the appropriate infection control guidance, particularly with regard to <abbr title="Aerosol Generating Procedures">AGPs</abbr> which may be undertaken by a funeral director and others.</p>

<p>This approach is supported by General Medical Council guidance on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/confidentiality/managing-and-protecting-personal-information#paragraph-134">Managing and protecting personal information</a> which states that âdisclosure is justified in the public interest to protect others from a risk of death or serious harmâ.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm"><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance</a> also advises that where there is a known or suspected risk of infection, sufficient information must be provided to enable people handling the deceased to supplement the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> with appropriate additional precautions to minimise exposure. This information must be handled sensitively and shared only with those who need it to carry out an appropriate risk assessment and to enable appropriate precautions to be taken: Whilst it is not essential to provide the specific details of the infectious agent, the information should include the detail of likely routes of transmission to ensure that adequate precautions may be taken.</p>

<h2>Members of the public who identify a death outside of a healthcare setting</h2>

<p>If you are a member of the public or a family member and you come into contact with a person who has died, including a loved one, please follow this advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>try not to touch the deceased person</li>
  <li>if there has been contact with the deceased, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds</li>
  <li>move to at least 2 metres away or to another room</li>
  <li>call the deceased personâs <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> (if the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> is not available you will be connected to the out of hours service) or call NHS 111 for further advice</li>
  <li>if the death was unexpected and you have not been engaging with the healthcare system regarding the patientâs condition prior to the death, please call 999 and explain the situation</li>
  <li>use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance on cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a> for managing the deceasedâs laundry and waste</li>
</ul>

<h2>First responders managing a death in the community</h2>

<p>If you are responding to a 999 call-out and are entering a home to assess whether a death has occurred, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on entry to the home, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>advise others not to enter the room</li>
  <li>stay at least 2 metres away from other household members</li>
  <li>wear <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> as indicated in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-interim-guidance-for-first-responders" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: guidance for first responders</a> if you are required to assess for signs of life</li>
</ul>

<p>Among first responders, ambulance staff and paramedics have different requirements for <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> as they may be required to perform <abbr title="Aerosol Generating Procedures">AGPs</abbr>. Additional specific <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-ambulance-trusts/covid-19-guidance-for-ambulance-trusts#personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link">guidance on <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr></a> is available for ambulance staff and paramedics.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-verification-of-death-in-times-of-emergency/coronavirus-covid-19-verifying-death-in-times-of-emergency" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19): verifying death in times of emergency</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="general practitioners (family doctors)">GPs</abbr> managing a death outside of a healthcare setting</h2>

<p>If you are a <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> and are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-verification-of-death-in-times-of-emergency">verifying death</a> and/or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-notes-for-completing-a-medical-certificate-of-cause-of-death" class="govuk-link">certifying the cause of death</a> of a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 outside a healthcare setting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on entry to the home, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>stay at least 2 metres away from other household members</li>
  <li>advise others not to enter the room in order to maintain at least 2 metres distance from the deceased</li>
  <li>wear <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> as indicated in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table2">Table 2. <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements for care of the deceased in non-clinical settings</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="general practitioners (family doctors)">GPs</abbr> should notify those who are handling the deceased when a death is suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 related as required. This information will enable correct management of the infection risk.</p>

<h2>Managing deaths in secondary care</h2>

<p>Where there has been a death in secondary care, healthcare workers should follow the recommendations in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: infection prevention and control (IPC</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-aerosol-generating-procedures" class="govuk-link">guidance on donning and doffing <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>: Droplet precautions</a>.</p>

<h2>Staff in residential care settings including care homes and hospices</h2>

<p>If a resident dies with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a residential care setting where you are a member of staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that all residents maintain a distance of at least 2 metres or are in another room from the deceased person</li>
  <li>avoid all non-essential contact with the deceased to minimise risk of exposure</li>
  <li>if you need to provide care for the deceased, this should be kept to a minimum and correct <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used as indicated in: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>) â resource for care workers working in care homes during sustained COVID-19 transmission in England</a>
</li>
  <li>you should follow the usual processes for dealing with a death in your setting, ensuring that infection prevention and control measures are implemented</li>
</ul>

<p>You should notify those who are handling the deceased when a death is either suspected or confirmed to be COVID-19 related. Sharing this information will enable correct management of the infection risk.</p>

<h2>Funeral directors managing a death in the community</h2>

<p>Funeral directors, in addition to faith and belief representatives, will often be the primary support to households in the immediate period after a death, including attending the home to collect and transfer the deceased. You should follow guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Working safely during the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)</a> and where possible, other support and advice should be provided over the phone.</p>

<p>If you are required to meet with the bereaved but will not make direct contact with the deceased, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain a safe distance (at least 2 metres) from the bereaved and other members of the household</li>
  <li>wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds on entry to the home â where facilities to wash hands are not available, hand sanitiser should be used</li>
  <li>avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth</li>
  <li>wash your hands (or use hand sanitiser) again when leaving the property</li>
  <li>wear a face covering in indoor places where social distancing may be difficult and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and before and after taking them off. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Find further detail on when and where to wear face coverings</a>
</li>
  <li>ask if windows and/or vents are opened to ventilate the room if possible without it getting uncomfortably cold</li>
</ul>

<p>This advice should be followed for all deaths in the community, including if someone in the household is symptomatic or self-isolating, or if the household is isolating.</p>

<p>If you are required to have close contact with the deceased, for example, to move them, the following precautions should be taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn as described in <a href="#Table2" class="govuk-link">Table 2</a>
</li>
  <li>to maintain social distancing, household members should be asked to leave the room containing the deceased, including any room that the deceased will travel through as they are moved from the premises</li>
  <li>placing a barrier, such as a cloth or mask, over the mouth of the deceased when moving them may prevent the release of droplets from the respiratory tract</li>
  <li>body bags are not essential although it is recognised that they are used routinely, as part of usual safe ways of working, to prevent leakage affecting the immediate environment and to help maintain dignity, including during repeated movement</li>
  <li>body bags are recommended where capacity in the usual management processes for the deceased is exceeded and management and/or transport of the deceased is being undertaken by individuals who may not be familiar with safe ways of working and appropriate use of <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>cloth wrappings (shrouds or wraps) and coffins may be used to manage the risk of contact transmission but are not a replacement for body bags in situations where they are recommended</li>
  <li>wipe down the external surface of the body bag/coffin with a combined detergent disinfectant solution as normally used within mortuary practice. Follow manufacturerâs instructions for dilution, combination, application and contact times for all detergents and disinfectants</li>
  <li>if body bags are used for cremation, they must not contain any PVC or any highly chlorinated materials</li>
</ul>

<p>Any member of staff who develops symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should be sent home and stay at home immediately and for at least 10 full days from onset of symptoms. If the member of staff lives in a household where someone else is unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 then the staff member must remain at home and not leave the house from the day of onset of illness and for the next 10 days, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, any member of staff who is legally required to self-isolate for example, if instructed by NHS Test and Trace because of recent close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, or due to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk" class="govuk-link">recent international travel into England</a>, must stay at home for the required period.</p>

<h2>Management of a funeral</h2>

<p>The grieving process and other religious, belief-based or commemorative events linked to a personâs death, through which the bereaved mourn the passing of loved ones, are important for the health and wellbeing of the bereaved.</p>

<p>There is separate guidance for funeral directors and others on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="http://www.dmag2020.org/important-updated-guidance-covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2/">managing a funeral during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> and for members of the public on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic" class="govuk-link">arranging or attending a funeral</a>.</p>

<h2>Guidance for staff who manage the deceased</h2>

<p>This includes mortuary staff, pathologists, anatomical pathology technologists, funeral directors and embalmers and appropriately trained volunteers.</p>

<p>Any member of staff who develops symptoms of COVID-19 (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste or smell) should be sent home immediately and stay at home from onset of symptoms and for the next 10 full days. If the member of staff lives in a household where someone else is unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 then the staff member must remain at home and not leave the house for 10 days, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person">guidance for contacts of people with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, any member of staff who is instructed by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate because of recent close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 must stay at home for the period instructed by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>If you are working with the deceased, including in temporary mortuaries, you should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Working safely during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)</a> and should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain at least 2 metres from others</li>
  <li>wash your hands more frequently than usual with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>Following a risk assessment of potential post-mortem risk pathways, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has developed this guidance with specific reference to the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Transmission-Based Precautions">TBPs</abbr> set out in the <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance on <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg283.htm" class="govuk-link">managing infection risks when handling the deceased</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance provides advice on the risks of infection from work activities involved with handling the deceased. It also provides guidance for those involved in funeral services, including embalmers, and those involved in the exhumation of human remains.</p>

<p>It covers the safe handling, storage and examination of bodies in hospitals, mortuaries and post-mortem rooms.  <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> guidance is not specific to COVID-19 but the <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Transmission-Based Precautions">TBPs</abbr> described are sufficient for managing the risk with additional precautions taken for <abbr title="Aerosol Generating Procedures">AGPs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Characteristics of the virus that causes COVID-19</h4>

<p>The exact duration that SARS-CoV2 virus (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) can remain infectious in body fluids and tissues in a deceased body is unknown and will depend on several factors. Residual hazard of infection from COVID-19 may arise from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>droplet generation emanating from the deceased during their care</li>
  <li>post-mortem examination or implant removal involving the use of power tools, which is a risk for aerosol generation</li>
  <li>direct contact with contaminated material such as soiled clothing or bedding from the deceased and the surrounding environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Placing a barrier, such as a cloth or mask, over the mouth of the deceased when moving them may prevent the release of droplets from the respiratory tract.</p>

<p>Other than circumstances where body bags are recommended, their use is not essential and, the deceased may be wrapped in cloth or a shroud to manage the risk of contact transmission.</p>

<p>Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV2 virus can be present for up to 72 hours on some types of environmental surfaces. Other human coronaviruses have been identified on environmental surfaces for up to 9 days so as a precaution, the principles of <abbr title="Standard Infection Control Precautions">SICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Transmission-Based Precautions">TBPs</abbr> should continue to apply while deceased individuals remain in the care environment even if beyond 72 hours.</p>

<p>There are currently no reliable data on how long the virus can persist on the deceased under refrigeration conditions. Refrigeration should still be used, and the deceased should be considered a potential source of infection while they remain in the care environment whether refrigerated or not. The appropriate <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> should be worn when handling the deceased (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#Table2" class="govuk-link">Table 2</a>).</p>

<h4>Preparations and final disposition</h4>

<p>Viewing, hygienic preparations such as washing and post-mortem investigations are permitted when overseen or undertaken by those trained in handling bodies of the deceased.</p>

<p>Embalming can take place when necessary, with appropriate consideration of procedures which may generate aerosols. Cremation is permitted and where the deceased has a medical device that requires removal prior to cremation, this should be done using <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of medical device removal will require droplet precautions only (for example, pacemakers and intrathecal pumps). Where there is the potential for aerosol generation through the use of high-speed tools or the removal of fixion nails, <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used as indicated in the <abbr title="Royal College of Pathologists">RCPath</abbr> and <abbr title="Association of Anatomical Pathology Technology">AAPT</abbr> guidance for autopsy procedures in <a rel="external" href="https://www.rcpath.org/uploads/assets/0b7d77fa-b385-4c60-b47dde930477494b/G200-TBPs-Guidance-for-care-of-deceased-during-COVID-19-pandemic.pdf" class="govuk-link">Transmission-based precautions: Guidance for care of deceased during COVID-19 pandemic</a> and as described in the second column of <a class="govuk-link" href="#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Those managing the deceased must make sure they maintain a safe distance (2 metres) from others in the work environment.</p>

<h3>Guidance for processing of samples taken from bodies</h3>

<p>Post-mortem examination may include taking samples for COVID-19 testing. The Chief Coronerâs office has published <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chief-Coroner-Guidance-No.-34-COVID-19_26_March_2020-.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">guidance on post-mortem examination practice</a>.</p>

<p>The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) <a href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/post-mortem-sector-guidance" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Post Mortem sector guidance</a> advises on what constitutes ârelevant materialâ for removal of a body and specifies that removal must take place on HTA-licensed premises.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance on COVID-19: laboratory investigations and sample requirements for diagnosis is available, including upper and lower respiratory tract sampling. A poster detailing <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879698/Sample_Packaging_Instructions_A3_poster.pdf" class="govuk-link">sampling and packing required</a> can also be downloaded.</p>

<p>If a post-mortem examination is performed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lung biopsy can be sent in a sterile universal container without any additive</li>
  <li>blood samples can also be collected and sent in a sterile container</li>
  <li>ideally, tissue samples should be fresh frozen and sent on dry ice where possible. The sample should NOT be placed in formalin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Precautions for others who are involved in the care of the deceased</h3>

<p>Staff involved in the care of the deceased outside of the formal funeral home or mortuary setting should consider what actions they need to take to ensure safe working. Table 2 details activities involved in the care of the deceased and the appropriate <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> required for these.</p>

<p>*The outside of the body bag/coffin should be wiped down with a combined detergent disinfectant solution as normally used within mortuary practice. Follow manufacturerâs instructions for dilution, combination, application and contact times for all detergents and disinfectants.</p>

<p>**Eye and face protection is recommended only if there is an anticipated/likely risk of contamination with splashes or droplets of blood or body fluids.</p>

<h2>Hygienic preparations, faith and belief practices and final disposition</h2>

<p>For those for whom care of the deceased is part of their faith, rituals such as viewing, keeping watch and hygienic preparations such as washing are an important part of the mourning process.</p>

<p>Where such practices involve close contact with the deceased, those handling the deceased should be aware that in cases where COVID-19 infection has been identified or is suspected, there is likely to be a continuing risk of infection from body fluids and tissues.</p>

<p>We strongly advise that any rituals or practices that bring people into close contact with the deceased with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be undertaken using appropriate <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr> (<a class="govuk-link" href="#Table2">Table 2</a>), under supervision of somebody trained in its use.</p>

<p>Given the increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness in clinically vulnerable people or clinically extremely vulnerable people, it is strongly advised that they have no contact at all with the deceased. They should not participate in any activities such as washing, preparing or dressing the deceased, regardless of whether or not they are wearing <abbr title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Guidance is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/covid-19-guidance-for-managing-a-funeral-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic#linked-religious-belief-based-or-commemorative-events">arranging and attending a funeral and  religious, belief-based or commemorative events linked to a personâs death</a>.</p>

<p>Any person who chooses to exempt themselves from their legal duty to self-isolate (because they or a close contact has tested positive for COVID-19) may do so to attend the funeral of a close family member. They must not leave self-isolation to participate in other religious, belief based or commemorative events linked to a personâs death, such as the washing, preparing or dressing of the deceased. This is because they risk transmitting virus either directly to others present or indirectly through contact with the deceased or surfaces in the immediate environment.</p>

<h2>Transporting the deceased</h2>

<p>Despite the additional precautions required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, every effort should be made to treat the deceased with sensitivity, dignity and respect.</p>

<p>Other than circumstances where body bags are recommended, their use is not essential. Cloth wrappings (shrouds or wraps) and coffins may also be used to manage the risk of contact transmission but are not a replacement for body bags in situations where they are recommended.</p>

<p>If neither body bag nor coffin has been used, cleaning of the vehicle should be in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings outside the home</a>.</p>

<h2>Associated legislation</h2>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature and that an employer should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37/contents" rel="external">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a>.</p>
