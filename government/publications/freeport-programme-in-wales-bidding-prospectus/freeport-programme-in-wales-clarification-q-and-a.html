<p>The bidding prospectus for the Freeport Programme in Wales sets out how ports can apply for Freeport status and further details on our proposals for the policy. With the publication of the bidding prospectus, the Welsh and UK governments launched the bidding process to select a Freeport location in Wales.</p>

<p>In the bidding prospectus we invited stakeholders to submit via email any questions they had about the Freeport policy and bidding process. This document aims to cover the key questions and themes that we received. Any potential applicants will be able to contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Freeports@gov.wales">Freeports@gov.wales</a> to request clarification on any of the content of the bidding prospectus until 6 October 2022. A summary of answers will be published online no later than 27 October 2022.</p>

<p>The successful location will subsequently be announced in Early Spring 2023 following a fair, open and transparent selection process.</p>

<p>The bidding period will close on 24 November 2022. We look forward to receiving bids from interested parties via the online portal by 6pm on Thursday 24 November 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong> - In the English/Scottish Freeport prospectus there is a requirement around&nbsp;‘simplified Planning zones’ and reference to Local Development Orders. Are you able to clarify/ confirm whether an LDO is a conditional requirement in the Welsh Freeport prospectus?</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> - As stated in section 3.8.2 of the prospectus, it says that: ‘in addition to the national planning context, local authorities should consider the application of local placed based tools such as Simplified Planning Zones (SPZ) or Local Development Orders (LDO). Both Simplified Planning Zones and Local Development Orders can provide greater certainty to business by removing the need to apply for planning permission for developments covered by the order.’</p>

<p>Whilst there is no conditional requirement to include a SPZ or LDO as part of the application, we do encourage planning authorities to create a facilitative planning environment. It will be the applicant coalition’s responsibility to undertake their own analysis and legal advice to confirm if any LDO compiled as part of the bid may conflict with SPA/SAC site designation</p>
