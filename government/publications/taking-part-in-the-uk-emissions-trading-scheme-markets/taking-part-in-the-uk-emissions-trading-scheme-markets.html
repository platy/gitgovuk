<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>) replaced the UK’s participation in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments and Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs – collectively making up the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority – have established the scheme to increase the climate ambition of the UK’s carbon pricing policy, while protecting the competitiveness of UK businesses. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> is established through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the operation of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets and how to take part in auctions and in trading on the secondary market.</p>

<p>For background information on the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-markets/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-markets">UK Emissions Trading Scheme markets</a> policy page.</p>

<p>For general guidance on participating in the scheme as an installation operator or aircraft operator, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets/participating-in-the-uk-ets">Participating in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions</h2>

<p>Auctioning will to be the primary means of introducing allowances into the market. Holders of Operator Holding Accounts (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>), Aircraft Operator Holding Accounts (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>) and trading accounts with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry will be able to take part in auctions.  Participants are also able to trade allowances on the secondary market.</p>

<p>For information about the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry and how to open an account if you are a trader, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets/participating-in-the-uk-ets">guidance on participating in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe currently provide the auction platform and secondary market services under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The auction calendar confirms the volume of allowances available in each auction. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/circulars/21184.pdf" rel="external">2022 auction calendar</a> was published on 3 November 2021. There is the potential for minor revisions to the 2022 auction calendar once volumes for aviation free allocation are finalised. The 2023 Auction Calendar will be published in the second half of 2022.</p>

<p>Auctions can clear, with allowances being sold to bidders, without all allowances being successfully bid for. Any remaining allowances not sold in an auction are redistributed across the following four auctions up to 125% of those auctions’ original number of allowances. Above this limit, allowances will transfer into the market stability mechanism account.</p>

<h2>The Auctioning Regulations</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348220049/contents" rel="external">The Auctioning Regulations</a> govern the auctioning of UK Allowances (UKAs) and the provision of a secondary market. The Auctioning Regulations and Explanatory Memorandum contain additional policy background relating to <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Auctions. BEIS has been appointed by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr> as UK Auctioneer for these auctions. This role is required by legislation and is responsible for the conduct of the auctions.</p>

<p>The Auctioning Regulations were made the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348220032/contents" rel="external">Recognised Auction Platforms (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions Regulations 2021) Affirmative Statutory Instrument</a>. This SI establishes a market and auction oversight role for the FCA in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and establishes UK emissions allowances as ‘financial instruments’, ensuring they are subject to the correct regulatory treatment.</p>

<p>These Statutory Instruments have been amended by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/513/contents/made" rel="external">Recognised Auction Platforms and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Auctioning (Amendment) Regulations 2021</a>. This Statutory Instrument updates the existing Instruments to provide greater clarity on the auction clearing price, the Cost Containment Mechanism (<abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr>) and the eligibility criteria for bidding in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions.</p>

<h2>Participating in auctions</h2>

<p>To be eligible to bid in <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> auctions, entities will need to be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> operator or a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> aircraft operator</li>
  <li>a member of a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> operator or <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> aircraft operator’s group (i.e. parent companies, subsidiaries or fellow subsidiaries) which is not required to be located in the UK</li>
  <li>a business grouping of <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> operators, <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> aircraft operators or their group, which is not required to be located in the UK</li>
  <li>public/state bodies of the UK that control <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> operators, <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> aircraft operators or members of their group</li>
  <li>a UK investment firm with a Part 4A <abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act">FSMA</abbr> permission that would require authorisation under the Markets in Financial Instruments directive (<abbr title="Markets in Financial Instruments directive">MiFID</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a UK credit institution with a Part 4A <abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act">FSMA</abbr> permission that would require authorisation under the Capital Requirements directive (<abbr title="Capital Requirements directive">CRD</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a third country (non-UK) investment firm with a Part 4A <abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act">FSMA</abbr> permission that would require authorisation under <abbr title="Markets in Financial Instruments directive">MiFID</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a third country (non-UK) credit institution with a Part 4A <abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act">FSMA</abbr> permission that would require authorisation under <abbr title="Capital Requirements directive">CRD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>a person covered by the exemption in paragraph 1(k) of Schedule 3 of the <abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act">FSMA</abbr> Regulated Activities Order 2001 (whose investment business is ancillary to their main commodities business, in accordance with regulation 16(2) of the Auctioning Regulations), provided they have a registered office (or head office if no registered office) in the UK.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Register for auctions</h3>

<p>Auction participants will need to register with <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> as the appointed auction platform. Market participants who are interested in bidding in the auction should visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.theice.com/emissions/auctions/uk-emission-allowances" rel="external"><abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe’s <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions page</a> and contact sales-utilities@theice.com.</p>

<p>Auction participants will also require an account in the <strong>UK Emissions Trading Registry</strong>. Entities can either open a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Trading account or, if holding a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Permit or Monitoring Plan already, can use their Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>) or Aircraft Operator Holding account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>) to take part in auctions.</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/participating-in-the-uk-ets/participating-in-the-uk-ets#registry">guidance on how to apply for a UK Registry Account</a>.</p>

<p>For operators and aircraft operators the OHAs and AOHAs will be opened for them by the Registry Administrator, however if they wish to buy and sell allowances, it is important that they register with <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> as soon as possible to start the process.</p>

<h2>Auction Reserve Price</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will have a transitional Auction Reserve Price (<abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr>) of £22, which establishes a minimum price for which allowances can be sold at auctions. Bids below this price will not be successful at auction. The <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> value was set in the Auctioning Regulations published on 11 February 2021, and the government does not intend to make any further changes to the level of the Auction Reserve Price before it is likely withdrawn as the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> matures. The government will consult on its intent to withdraw the <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> as part of the planned consultation to appropriately align the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> cap with a net zero trajectory which will be launched later this year.</p>

<h2>Participating in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> secondary market</h2>

<p>Once allowances have been released through auctions and free allocation, they can be traded on the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> secondary market. The secondary market provides a means for market participants to source allowances outside auctions and free allocation, and it enables participants to plan ahead through hedging future carbon costs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe hosts a secondary market for <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> derivatives. To find out more about how to participate in the secondary market hosted by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe, email sales-utilities@theice.com.</p>

<p>If you are a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> participant with compliance obligations seeking assistance on participating in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> secondary market, you may wish to consider researching brokers for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> trading, or contacting your commodity trading partner or corporate bank for advice.</p>

<h2>Cost Containment Mechanism</h2>

<p>The Cost Containment Mechanism (<abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr>) provides a powerful tool for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority to intervene if prices are elevated for a sustained period. The UK <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> has lower price and time triggers in the first 2 years of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> when compared to the equivalent <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> mechanism: this is to ensure the intervention can be more agile in early years while the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> matures.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered, the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will consider what intervention, if any, to make. Their decision will be based on addressing sustained price movements that do not correspond to market fundamentals. If there is no agreement on what action to take, the final decision will be taken by HM Treasury (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr>). This intervention can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>redistributing allowances between the current year’s auctions</li>
  <li>increasing the volume of allowances to be auctioned by:
    <ul>
      <li>bringing forward auctioned allowances from future years</li>
      <li>drawing allowances from the market stability mechanism account</li>
      <li>auctioning up to 25% of the remaining allowances in the New Entrants’ Reserve</li>
      <li>auctioning allowances which form part of the industry cap on free allocation to stationary installations for the current or past scheme years where the amount of free allocation is lower than the industry cap</li>
      <li>bringing allowances into auctions from the flexible share</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the decision about what intervention, if any, to make will be clearly communicated to participants in a timely manner.</p>

<p>An explanation of the operation of the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/484/regulation/12" rel="external">Explanatory Memorandum to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Auctioning Regulations</a>.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> Trigger Price</h3>

<p>Until January 2022, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> was triggered if the average end of day settlement price of a UK allowance (<abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr>) December futures contract was more than 2 times the average price for the preceding 2-year ‘reference period’, for 3 consecutive months (the ‘monitoring period’).</p>

<p>From February 2022 until January 2023, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the average end of day settlement price of the relevant <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is more than 2.5 times the average price for the reference period for the duration of the monitoring period.</p>

<p>From February 2023 onwards, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the relevant <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> futures contract is 3 times the average price for the reference period for 6 consecutive months.</p>

<p>These diagrams show 2 scenarios where the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> would and would not be triggered.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/142689/ccm-ets-1.jpg"></div></figure>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/142690/ccm-ets-2.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>The 2-year reference period ends when the 3 consecutive months monitoring period starts. This means that the whole period under consideration is 27 months, split into 2 components – the 2-year ‘reference period’, followed by the 3-month ‘monitoring period’. To calculate the carbon price in the 2-year reference period, a combination of EU allowance (<abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr>) December future contracts and <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December future contracts may be used dependent upon when the 2-year reference is counted from. <abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr> prices are used as a reference due to the limited <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> market data available since the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> secondary market only started in May 2021.</p>

<p>When the 2-year reference period starts in 2019 or 2020, the carbon price calculation includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of day settlement prices of the EU allowance (<abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr>) December futures contracts up until 31 December 2020. After this date <abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr> prices are no longer counted. This price was converted from EUR to GBP using the respective historical daily spot exchange rate, provided by the Bank of England</li>
  <li>from 1 January 2021 onwards, the end of day settlement prices of the <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contracts is counted. However, from 1 January 2021 to 18 May 2021 there were no <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> future contracts. Therefore, these days are treated as non-trading days and do not contribute to the 2-year average</li>

<p>The monthly average carbon price is calculated by dividing the sum of the end of day settlement prices for the relevant December futures contract during each month by the number of days in the month for which a price is published. For trading days from 19 May 2021 until 30 November 2021, the 2021 <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is used. From 1 December 2021 until the 30 November 2022, the 2022 <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is used.</p>

<p>In order for the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> to be triggered in 2022, there must be 3 consecutive months where monthly average prices are above the trigger price.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> was triggered in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme for both December 2021 and January 2022. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority decided not to intervene in the market on both occasions. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-ets-authority-cost-containment-mechanism-decisions/uk-ets-authority-statement-cost-containment-mechanism-decision-december-2021"><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority Decision Statements</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>May 2022 trigger</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> was not be triggered for May 2022 since the average monthly prices in February, March and April were below the trigger price for May (£95.06).</p>

<h4>June 2022</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> cannot be triggered for June 2022 since the average monthly price in March and April were below the trigger price for June (£102.74).</p>

<h4>July 2022</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> cannot be triggered for July 2022 since the monthly average price in April was below the trigger price for July (£110.55).</p>

<h4>August 2022</h4>

<p>To calculate whether the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered for August 2022, the relevant reference period is 1 May 2020 to 30 April 2022. The trigger price for August is £117.71. If the monthly average prices in May, June and July are above £117.71 the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered for August 2022.</p>

<p>Triggering the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> in any month runs separately from triggering for previous months, and depends on the calculation of future average monthly prices.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will update this page monthly with the latest <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> trigger prices and monthly average carbon prices. The next monthly update will be on 10 June.</p>
