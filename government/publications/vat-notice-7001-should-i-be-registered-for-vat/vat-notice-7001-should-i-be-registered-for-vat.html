<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>This notice cancels and replaces Notice 700/1 (October 2019).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> What this notice is about</h3>

<p>This notice tells you when you must register for VAT and how to do it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Who should read this notice</h3>

<p>You should read this notice if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make business supplies of goods or services in the UK regardless of where you live, or where your business is established</li>
  <li>import goods into the UK</li>
  <li>import acquisitions if you are a business in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>sell certain assets</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Force of law</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Example-forms">Section 16</a> contains images of a number of VAT forms which carry the force of law under Regulations 5 and 10 of the VAT Regulations 1995.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Basic principles</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> VAT: an introduction</h3>

<p>VAT is a tax businesses have to charge when they make business supplies (that is, they sell goods or services) in the UK or Isle of Man.</p>

<p>Examples of business supplies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selling new and used goods, including by hire purchase</li>
  <li>providing a service, for example, hairdressing or decorating</li>
  <li>charging an admission price to go into buildings</li>
  <li>a self-employed person providing supplies, for example, some salesmen and subcontractors</li>
</ul>

<p>VAT is also charged on goods and some services which are brought into the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> VAT rates</h3>

<p>The standard rate of VAT is 20% for most goods and services. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-rates">check the VAT rates for goods and services</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Taxable supplies</h3>

<p>A taxable supply is any supply made in the UK which is not exempt from VAT. Taxable supplies include those which are zero-rated for VAT.</p>

<p>A supply which is not VAT-exempt is always a taxable supply whether or not the person making it is registered for VAT.</p>

<p>However, you do not have to account for VAT on the taxable supplies you make when both of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re not required by law to be VAT registered</li>
  <li>you have not registered for VAT voluntarily</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">If</th>
      <th scope="col">then</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>the value of the taxable supplies you make is over a specified threshold</td>
      <td>you must register for VAT</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>you’re an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#NETPs-basic-information">section 9</a>), and you make any taxable supplies in the UK, regardless of their value and including supplies of digital services</td>
      <td>you must register for VAT</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>you’re registered for VAT</td>
      <td>you must account for VAT on all the taxable supplies you make (apart from the zero-rated ones) from the date that you’re first registered</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In most cases, a ‘supply’ is the sale of goods or services, including sale by barter. It can also include ‘deemed supplies’. Deemed supplies include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some services you receive from overseas (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-place-of-supply-of-services-notice-741a#sec5">VAT Notice 741: place of supply of services-before 1 January 2010</a>, section 16) – although you receive the supply, you’re deemed also to have made it</li>
  <li>where you use your own labour to construct a building for your own business use, you are, in certain circumstances, deemed to have supplied the value of the labour (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-708-buildings-and-construction">VAT Notice 708: buildings and construction</a>, section 25)</li>
  <li>receipt of specified goods and services which are subject to the domestic reverse charge (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-735-vat-reverse-charge-on-specified-goods-and-services">VAT Notice 735: VAT domestic reverse charge on specified goods and services</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT helpline</a> for further advice if you think this applies to you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Zero-rated supplies</h3>

<p>Zero-rated supplies are taxable supplies on which the current VAT rate is 0%.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>most food (but not meals in restaurants or cafes, or hot takeaway food and drink)</li>
  <li>books</li>
  <li>newspapers</li>
  <li>young children’s clothing and shoes</li>
  <li>exported goods (for further information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-703-export-of-goods-from-the-uk">VAT Notice 703: export of goods from the UK</a>)</li>
  <li>most prescriptions dispensed to a patient by a registered pharmacist</li>
  <li>most public transport services</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a full list. If you are not sure whether the supplies you make are zero-rated, please call the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT helpline</a>.</p>

<p>If all or most of your supplies are zero-rated, you may not need to be registered for VAT. This is called exemption from registration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#When-you-might-be">paragraph 3.11</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Reduced-rate supplies</h3>

<p>Reduced-rate supplies are taxable supplies on which the current VAT rate is 5%.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supplies of domestic fuel or power</li>
  <li>installation of energy-saving materials</li>
  <li>grant-funded installation of heating equipment or security goods or connection of a gas supply</li>
  <li>children’s car seats</li>
  <li>residential conversions</li>
  <li>residential renovations and alterations</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a full list. If you are not sure whether the supplies you make are reduced-rated, please call the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Exempt supplies</h3>

<p>Exempt supplies are business supplies which do not meet the definition of taxable supplies. In other words, they’re business supplies on which VAT is not charged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Opting to tax land and buildings</h3>

<p>You can voluntarily opt to tax certain supplies of land and buildings which would otherwise be exempt from VAT. You can find out more about this, and how to do it, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-742a-opting-to-tax-land-and-buildings">VAT Notice 742A: opting to tax land and buildings</a>. Opting to tax means that you will charge VAT on the supplies you make.</p>

<p>If you opt to tax, you must include the value of the supplies of the land and buildings covered by the option in your taxable turnover when you’re deciding whether you’re liable to be registered. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#Working-out-the-value">paragraph 3.4</a>, or if you wish to register on a voluntary basis, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Registering-for-VAT-voluntarily">paragraph 3.9</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re applying to register for VAT online, tell HMRC that your business is involved with land or property. You’ll then be guided to download and complete the forms you’ll need for an option to tax.</p>

<p>If you’re applying to register for VAT using a paper form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-registration-vat1">VAT1: application for registration</a>, you’ll need to enclose written notification that you’re opting to tax.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> If you only supply goods or services abroad</h3>

<p>If you’ve got a business establishment in the UK (including a branch or agency) or you usually live in the UK and you only make supplies to customers outside the UK, but those supplies would be taxable if you made them in the UK, you can register for VAT on a voluntary basis. This is as long as you receive taxable supplies from UK VAT registered businesses, or import goods into the UK and you’d be entitled to claim back the VAT on those supplies.</p>

<p>If you think you might be able to register, please phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT helpline</a> for more advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span> Taking over a business</h3>

<p>If you take over a VAT registered business, or part of a VAT registered business, from somebody else as a going concern, you may be liable to be registered (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taking-over-a-business-as-a-going-concern">paragraph 3.8</a>).</p>

<p>If you’re liable to be registered</p>

<ul>
  <li>your registration date will be the date you take over the business</li>
  <li>you may be able to transfer the previous VAT registration number to yourself</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#How-and-when-to">Section 4</a> tells you how to register for VAT in these circumstances.</p>

<p>Even if the previous owner was not registered for VAT, you should still check to see whether you need to register. <a class="govuk-link" href="#Working-out-whether">Section 3</a> will help you to work that out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.11 </span> You’ve been registered for VAT before</h3>

<p>When you apply to register for VAT, tell HMRC if you are currently involved, or have been involved in the last 2 years, in any other VAT registration.</p>

<p>We can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ask for a payment in advance</li>
  <li>a guarantee as security</li>
</ul>

<p>if we think we’ll have problems collecting money from you. The information you give us when you apply to register will help us decide whether we need to do this.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tax-deposits-and-bonds-employers-and-traders">Tax deposits and bonds</a> guidance explains when we might require security.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.12 </span> You live or work abroad</h3>

<p>If you live in this country but carry out part of your business abroad, or you’ve got a place of business in this country but you live abroad, you may still have to register.</p>

<p>You’ve got a business establishment in the UK so you’d be liable to register subject to the normal rules.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Working out whether you need to register</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> When you have to register for VAT</h3>

<p>You have to register for VAT when the total value of your taxable supplies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taxable-supplies">paragraph 2.3</a>) and relevant acquisitions (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Relevant-acquisitions">section 6</a>) goes over the current registration thresholds.</p>

<p>If you’re a non-established taxable person (<abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr>), the registration threshold for taxable supplies does not apply to you, so you’ll have to register for VAT if you make taxable supplies of any value in the UK. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#when-you-have-to-register">paragraph 8.3</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You may have to register for VAT if you take over a VAT-registered business as a going concern (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taking-over-a-business">paragraphs 2.10</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taking-over-a-business-as-a-going-concern">3.8</a> for further information).</p>

<p>You’re a taxable person once you’re either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered</li>
  <li>required to be registered</li>
</ul>

<p>As a taxable person, from the date that you’re required to be registered, you must account for VAT on all of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable supplies</li>
  <li>relevant supplies in the UK</li>
  <li>distance sales and acquisitions if you are a business in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Registration thresholds</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7001-should-i-be-registered-for-vat/vat-notice-7001-supplement--2#registration-limits-taxable-supplies">Supplement</a> to this notice has details of past and current registration thresholds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> When you have to register for VAT -  how to work it out</h3>

<p>If you make taxable supplies in the UK (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taxable-supplies">paragraph 2.3</a>), you’re liable to register if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the end of any month, the value of your taxable supplies in the previous 12 months or less is over the registration threshold</li>
  <li>at any time, you expect the value of your taxable supplies in the next 30 day period alone, to go over the registration threshold</li>
</ul>

<p>For help with working out the value of your taxable supplies, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Working-out-the-value">paragraph 3.4</a>.</p>

<p>If you make distance sales into Northern Ireland (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Distance-selling">section 6</a>), you’re liable to register if, at any time during the calendar year from 1 January, your total goes over the distance sales threshold. If you make distance sales in the UK of excise goods, such as tobacco or alcohol, you must register for VAT whatever their value (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#If-you-make-distance-sales">paragraph 6.6</a>).</p>

<p>If you are a business in Northern Ireland and make acquisitions, you’re liable to register if one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the end of any month, the total value of your relevant acquisitions from all EU states in the year, or part year, from 1 January has gone over the registration threshold</li>
  <li>it’s reasonable to assume that the value of the relevant acquisitions you’ll make in the next 30 days alone will be over the registration threshold</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re liable to register if you make any relevant supplies in the UK, or at any time, you’ve got reasonable grounds to believe you’ll make relevant supplies within the next 30 days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Working out the value of your taxable supplies</h3>

<p>If you’re making taxable supplies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taxable-supplies">paragraph 2.3</a>) you need to know what your taxable turnover is so that you can work out if and when you need to register for VAT.</p>

<p>Your taxable turnover is the total value of all the taxable supplies (including the zero-rated ones) which you make in the UK or Isle of Man. You do not need to include the value of any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capital assets (such as buildings, equipment or vehicles) which you’ve sold</li>
  <li>exempt supplies you’ve made (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Exempt-supplies">paragraph 2.6</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you’ve sold land or buildings which are subject to an option to tax, and the sale was not zero-rated, you must include that sale in your taxable turnover.</p>

<p>There are special rules for working out your taxable turnover if you’re a tour operator and you make taxable supplies which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are normally used by travellers, for example, hotel and holiday accommodation or passenger transport</li>
  <li>you buy in and re-supply to travellers without charging them</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7095-tour-operators-margin-scheme">VAT Notice 709/5: tour operators margin scheme</a> explains the rules and tells you how to account for VAT on these supplies if you become registered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Working out the value of your distance sales</h3>

<p>When you’re working out the total value of your distance sales, you can exclude any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new means of transport you’ve bought</li>
  <li>goods which you’ve installed or assembled at your customers’ premises</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Types of registration</h3>

<p>You can register as a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sole proprietor</li>
  <li>partnership</li>
  <li>corporate body</li>
  <li>club or association</li>
</ul>

<p>Two or more corporate bodies may apply to register as a single taxable person (VAT group) if they can meet certain conditions.</p>

<p>A corporate body can apply to register each division separately if it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is organised in divisions</li>
  <li>carries on its business in divisions</li>
  <li>can meet certain conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about these types of registration in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7002-group-and-divisional-registration">VAT Notice 700/2: group and divisional registration</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> You’ve gone over the registration threshold temporarily</h3>

<p>You may not have to register if, at the end of any month:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your taxable supplies went over the registration threshold in the last 12 months</li>
  <li>you can show HMRC that your taxable supplies will not go over the deregistration threshold in the next 12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called exception from registration.</p>

<p>You’ve still got to tell HMRC’s VAT Registration Service that you’ve reached the threshold within 30 days of the end of that month, but you will not have to fill in any forms if we allow you exception from registration.</p>

<p>If we have allowed you exception from registration, this does not mean you’ll never have to register. Keep on checking the value of your taxable supplies every month to see whether you’ve gone over the threshold again. Do not leave out any supplies just because we’ve allowed you exception from registration since you made them. If you do become liable to register again, you can apply for exception again if you can show us that you meet the criteria.</p>

<p>If we’re not satisfied that you meet the criteria for exception from registration, we’ll register you for VAT from the day you were liable to be registered (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#When-you-have-to-register-for-VAT-how-to-work-it-out">paragraph 3.3</a>), and you’ll need to account for VAT from that date. So it’s in your own interests to send us your application, with a full explanation, as early as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Taking over a business as a going concern</h3>

<p>If you take over a business, or part of one, from someone who was, or should have been, registered for VAT, there are some checks you need to do.</p>

<p>Work out the value of the taxable supplies the business made in the 12 months before it was  transferred to you.</p>

<p>Add that figure to the value of any taxable supplies you made in the 12 months before the transfer.</p>

<p>The person who sells the business to you is responsible for keeping the business records from before the date of the sale. But they should give you all the information you need to meet your VAT obligations.</p>

<p>If you want to use the previous owner’s VAT number, you and the seller must both tell us separately.

<p>If the business you’re buying included land or property under an option to tax, the option will not transfer to you automatically. If you want to continue to charge VAT, you’ll need to make your own option to tax.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Registering for VAT voluntarily</h3>

<p>If you are not liable to be registered because the value of your:
* taxable supplies
* distance sales
* acquisitions</p>

<p>is below the thresholds, you can apply for voluntary registration.</p>

<p>You can also apply to register before you start to make taxable supplies, distance sales or acquisitions.</p>

<p>You may only register if you’re in business. HMRC defines business as a continuing activity carried on with the intention of making supplies for a consideration. Non-business activities can include those carried on as a hobby, or supplies made in a purely private capacity (for example, the sale of personal belongings). The terms business and non-business are explained in greater detail in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, we may ask you to show us that you plan to make taxable supplies.</p>

<p>You can apply for voluntary registration to be backdated by up to 4 years from the current date.</p>

<p>Think carefully about whether registering will really benefit you.</p>

<p>If we agree to register you from an earlier date, you can recover VAT other people charged you in respect of your taxable supplies from that date.</p>

<p>However, you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must also account for VAT on all the reduced-rate and standard-rate taxable supplies, distance sales and acquisitions you made from that date</li>
  <li>cannot normally change the date later</li>
</ul>

<p>If you apply to register for VAT, you should follow the instructions in <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-to-apply-to-register-for-VAT">paragraph 4.1</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Registering for VAT voluntarily if you make relevant acquisitions</h3>

<p>You may apply for voluntary registration if you can show HMRC that you’re making, or intend to make, relevant acquisitions, even if the value of those relevant acquisitions is below the threshold.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#Registering-for-VAT-voluntarily">Paragraph 3.9</a> gives more information about voluntarily registering for VAT.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Your VAT registration number – when to expect it</h3>

<p>When HMRC gets your application, we need to check all the details before we can send you your VAT registration number.</p>

<p>If you’ve used the online application system, we’ll send you an online message within 3 working days which will either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell you what your VAT registration number is</li>
  <li>let you know there’s going to be a delay because we need more information from you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve sent your application on a paper form, we aim to send a certificate which shows your full registration details within 15 working days of receiving the form. Do not contact us before then or you might delay us processing your application.</p>

<p>The application may take longer to process if we need more information from you.</p>

<p>If you have not heard from us after 15 working days, please contact our VAT Registration Service to make sure that they have received your application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> If you do not tell HMRC at the right time</h3>

<p>Regardless of when you let HMRC know, we’ll register you from the date you were liable to be registered.</p>

<p>You’ll also have to account for VAT from that date even if you did not charge it to your customers. You may be able to offset this against any input tax on costs you’ve incurred and for which you hold VAT invoices, subject to the normal rules (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#VAT-you-paid-before-you-registered">paragraph 5.2</a>).</p>

<p>If you do not register at the right time, you might get a financial penalty. <a class="govuk-link" href="#errors-late-notification-fraud">Section 15</a> gives more information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Accounting for VAT</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Keeping records and charging VAT – when to start</h3>

<p>You must start keeping records and accounting for VAT from the date you become liable to register.</p>

<p>You may wish to increase your prices to include VAT. Do not show VAT as a separate item on any invoices you issue until you’ve received your registration number. You can explain to your VAT-registered customers that you’ll be sending them VAT invoices later. Once you’ve got your registration number, you should send them the necessary invoices showing VAT within 30 days.</p>

<p>If you’ve asked for voluntary registration, you should start keeping records and accounting for VAT from the date you’re registered. This will normally be the registration date you asked for.</p>

<p>Once you’re registered, you must account for VAT on all of the following that you make in the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable supplies (apart from the zero-rated ones)</li>
  <li>distance sales</li>
  <li>acquisitions</li>
  <li>relevant supplies</li>
</ul>

<p>This is regardless of whether those values are above the individual registration thresholds.</p>

<p>Remember, you’ll have to account for VAT from your registration date. Submit your application as early as you can so that HMRC can let you have your registration number in good time.</p>

<h3 class="2">
<span class="number">5.2 </span> VAT you paid before you registered</h3>

<p>Subject to certain conditions, you can claim back any VAT you’re charged on goods or services which you use to set up your business. These conditions are listed in section 11 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700#section11">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<p>Normally, this will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VAT on goods supplied to you for use in your business up to 4 years before your registration date and which you have not used up or sold</li>
  <li>VAT on services supplied to you not more than 6 months before your registration date</li>
</ul>

<p>We may allow you to backdate your registration voluntarily by up to 4 years when you apply to register. You should think carefully about whether this would be a good idea for you because, once we agree a registration date with you, we will not normally allow you to change that date.</p>

<p>You should include your claim for this VAT on your first VAT return. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a> tells you how to do this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> The records you need to keep</h3>

<p>You need to keep records of all your business sales and purchases. You should also keep a note of all the VAT you’ve charged and paid for each VAT return period. This is called a VAT account.</p>

<p>If you’re already in business, you’ll probably find that your normal business records already provide most of this information.</p>

<p>There is more information about what you need to do in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70021-keeping-vat-records">VAT Notice 700/21: keeping VAT records</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Schemes which might help you to account for VAT</h3>

<p>HMRC offers a number of schemes which are designed to make accounting for VAT easier for you.</p>

<p>If you sell direct to the public you might be able to account for VAT using a retail scheme - for more information about these schemes, including the special records you need to keep, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-727-retail-schemes">VAT Notice 727: retail schemes</a>.</p>

<p>The Cash Accounting Scheme allows eligible businesses to account for VAT on the basis of payments received and made – for more information about this scheme, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-731-cash-accounting">VAT Notice 731: cash accounting</a>.</p>

<p>The Annual Accounting Scheme allows eligible businesses to complete a single annual VAT return – for more information about this scheme, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-732-annual-accounting">VAT Notice 732: annual accounting</a>.</p>

<p>The Flat Rate Scheme offers eligible, small businesses an alternative to the normal basis of accounting for VAT. If you use the scheme, you will not have to record VAT in your accounts against every purchase and sale. Instead, you can work out the net amount of VAT you need to pay HMRC as a percentage of your total turnover. For more information about the scheme, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-733-flat-rate-scheme-for-small-businesses">VAT Notice 733: Flat Rate Scheme for small businesses</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> The VAT Return</h3>

<p>This is the document you use to tell HMRC how much VAT you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>owe on your sales</li>
  <li>are claiming back on your purchases</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also need to tell us the value of the goods and services you bought and sold during the period of the return. When you submit your VAT Return, you should pay any tax you owe. If we owe you tax, your VAT Return will be your claim for repayment.</p>

<p>You’ll normally have to submit a VAT Return every 3 months. We call the period covered by this return your tax period.</p>

<p>To find out more, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70012-filling-in-your-vat-return">VAT Notice 700/12: how to fill in and submit your VAT Return</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll normally expect you to submit your VAT Returns over the internet. There is more information about this service and how you register to use it on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">GOV.UK</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gateway.gov.uk/" rel="external">Government Gateway</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Monthly VAT Returns</h3>

<p>Once you’re registered for VAT, if you expect your input tax will be more than your output tax, you can ask HMRC to issue your VAT Returns on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, we may require you to submit your VAT Returns once a month.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Outputs and inputs</h3>

<p>These are the sales and purchases you make for your business.</p>

<p>Your sales are your outputs and the VAT you charge on them is your output tax.</p>

<p>If your customers are registered for VAT, your outputs are their inputs and your output tax is their input tax.</p>

<p>In the same way, the VAT which other businesses charge you is your input tax.</p>

<p>You take your total input tax figure away from your total output tax figure and pay the balance to HMRC. If your input tax is greater than your output tax, you claim the difference back from HMRC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span> Tax periods which match your financial year</h3>

<p>HMRC can normally arrange this. Ask us when you register.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Distance selling</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Distance selling – definition</h3>

<p>Distance selling is when a taxable person based in Northern Ireland  or an EU member state supplies and delivers goods to a customer in Northern Ireland or an EU member state and the customer is not registered for VAT or liable to be registered for VAT.</p>

<p>We call these customers ‘non-taxable persons’. They include private individuals as well as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public bodies</li>
  <li>charities</li>
  <li>businesses which are not registered for VAT because their turnover is below the registration threshold, or their activities are entirely exempt from VAT</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common example of distance sales is mail order sales.</p>

<p>If you make distance sales in the UK of goods which are subject to Excise Duty, there are special rules. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#If-you-make-distance-sales">paragraph 6.6</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> After you register in the UK</h3>

<p>Once you’re registered for VAT in the UK, you have to follow all the usual rules which apply to UK VAT-registered businesses.</p>

<p>You have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep a record of all the distance sales you make to the UK</li>
  <li>issue VAT invoices to all your customers, including those who are private individuals</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about VAT invoices, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<p>You also have to account for VAT on all of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable supplies</li>
  <li>acquisitions</li>
  <li>relevant supplies</li>
</ul>

<p>in the UK, whether or not the values of those types of supply are over the relevant registration thresholds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> If you make distance sales to more than one EU member state</h3>

<p>Once the value of your sales to any EU member state goes over that state’s distance-selling threshold, you will have to register in that state separately.</p>

<p>If you’re making sales to more than one EU member state, you should keep separate records of the value of your sales to each state. This will help you to register in each state at the right time.</p>

<p>You’re responsible for making sure you account for VAT to the correct tax authority.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span> If you want to make the UK your place of supply</h3>

<p>You can choose to make the UK the place of supply for your distance sales if they’re below the UK threshold.</p>

<p>If you want to do this, you will have to register for VAT in the UK. You will have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-registration-distance-selling-vat1a">VAT1A: application for registration - distance selling</a> to tell HMRC you want to register in the UK at least 30 days before you make your first supply</li>
  <li>register for VAT in the UK from the date of the first supply after you opted to account for the VAT in the UK</li>
  <li>account for VAT in the UK on all distance sales you make in the UK</li>
  <li>comply with all the usual UK VAT rules – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a>
</li>
  <li>normally remain registered in the UK for at least 2 years</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Registering in the UK before you start making distance sales</h3>

<p>You can apply to register for VAT in the UK before you start to make any distance sales in the UK.</p>

<p>If you want to do this, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>satisfy HMRC that, from a certain date, you’ve a real intention to make distance sales to the UK and account for VAT in the UK</li>
  <li>fill in a form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-application-for-registration-distance-selling-vat1a">VAT1A: application for registration – distance selling</a> and send it to us</li>
  <li>enclose written evidence showing you’ve made firm arrangements to start making distance sales</li>
  <li>tell HMRC the date you wish to be registered from and the date you expect to make your first distance sale</li>
</ul>

<p>If we’re not satisfied that you intend to make distance sales in the UK, we may refuse your application.</p>

<p>This will normally only apply to organisations located in the UK which either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the acquisitions in the UK to make only non-business supplies</li>
  <li>make wholly exempt supplies</li>
</ul>

<p>If you register for VAT because of your acquisitions, you will not usually be able to claim any VAT back on your purchases. This is because you’re not making any taxable supplies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> When you must register and account for VAT</h3>

<p>When the total value of your acquisitions is over the registration threshold, you have to register and account for VAT in the UK. <a class="govuk-link" href="#Working-out-whether">Section 3</a> tells you about the threshold and how to work out if you need to register.</p>

<p>When you make an acquisition, VAT becomes due from you when you acquire the goods. You should account for it on your VAT Return. For more information, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-725-the-single-market">VAT Notice 725: the single market</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re not registered for VAT in the UK, you’ll be charged VAT in the EU member state where you buy the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Registering for VAT if you’re below the threshold</h3>

<p>HMRC will allow you to register if you’re below the threshold, but you should remember that it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to claim any VAT back on your purchases. Once registered, you’ll have to comply with the normal UK VAT registration requirements. You must normally remain registered for 2 clear calendar years after your registration date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Registering for VAT before starting to make acquisitions</h3>

<p>If you want to do this, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> When registration for acquisitions is not required</h3>

<p>You will not need to register because of your acquisitions if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are already registered for VAT</li>
  <li>have already applied to register for VAT</li>
  <li>are a private individual buying goods from EU countries for your own use and not for use in a business of any kind – in these circumstances, you will be charged VAT on the goods in the country you buy them from</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Relevant supplies of assets</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Relevant supplies – definition</h3>

<p>A relevant supply is a taxable supply of goods which are assets of a business where the person making the supply, or a predecessor (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Predecessor-definition">paragraph 8.2</a>) has received or claimed,  or is intending to claim  , a repayment of VAT.</p>

<p>A relevant supply includes the supply of an asset which incorporates parts on which such a repayment has been claimed.</p>

<p>An asset includes a capital asset.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Predecessor – definition</h3>

<p>A predecessor is someone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claimed the repayment of VAT</li>
  <li>transferred the assets under the provisions which allow VAT relief on the transfer of a business or part of a business, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-7009-transfer-of-business-as-a-going-concern">VAT Notice 700/9: transfer of a business as a going concern</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where there has been more than one transfer, the predecessor may be a person several transfers back. The liability of the assets to be a relevant supply does not change.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> When you have to register</h3>

<p>You have to register if you make, or intend to make, a relevant supply in the next 30 days.</p>

<p>There is no registration threshold for relevant supplies.</p>

<p>Unregistered persons who are established in the UK and who make relevant supplies may be liable to register. They’ll normally only be affected where a predecessor of theirs made a claim under the Eighth or Thirteenth Directive refund arrangements. They may be entitled to claim exemption from registration. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#When-you-might-be">paragraph 3.11</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re already registered for VAT, you will not be affected unless you’re considering deregistering.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr> – definition</h3>

<p>A non-established taxable person (<abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr>) is any person who is not normally resident in the UK, does not have a UK establishment and, in the case of a company, is not incorporated in the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> UK establishment: definition</h3>

<p>A UK establishment exists if either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>place where essential management decisions are made and the business’s central administration is carried out is in the UK</li>
  <li>business has a permanent physical presence with the human and technical resources to make or receive taxable supplies in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>We would normally consider a company which is incorporated in the UK to have an establishment in the UK as long as it’s able to receive business supplies at its registered office.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> When an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr> must register for VAT in the UK</h3>

<p>If you make any taxable supplies (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#Taxable-supplies">paragraph 2.3</a>) in the UK, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register for VAT in the UK</li>
  <li>account for UK VAT to HMRC</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> If you have an establishment in the UK</h3>

<p>If you have a UK establishment, you are not an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr>. You’ll be registered at the address of your principal UK place of business. Your VAT records and accounts should be kept at this address and should be available for HMRC to inspect.</p>

<p>You should ensure that someone responsible for your VAT affairs can be available at the address. If that person is an employee, you should give them written authority to act on your behalf. A suggested form of words for this authority is at <a class="govuk-link" href="#Letter-to-authorise">paragraph 11.7</a>.</p>

<p>A separate authority will not be required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the person has been notified to the Registrar of Companies under the Companies Act 1985, Part XXIII as a UK resident authorised to accept service of process on behalf of the company</li>

<span class="number">10.1 </span> When an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr> can register voluntarily</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to register in the UK voluntarily and claim back any VAT you’ve been charged in the UK if you intend to make taxable supplies in the UK more than 30 days in the future. <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-and-when-to">Section 4</a> explains how to register.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> <abbr title="non-established taxable persons">NETPs</abbr> – tax representatives and agents</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Tax representatives – appointment and role</h3>

<p>If you’re an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr>, you may appoint a tax representative.</p>

<p>A tax representative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must keep your VAT records and accounts and account for UK VAT on your behalf</li>
  <li>is jointly and severally liable for any VAT debts you incur</li>
</ul>

<p>You may only appoint one person at a time to act on your behalf, although a tax representative may act for more than one principal at any time.</p>

<p>For each principal a tax representative represents, they must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep separate VAT accounts</li>
  <li>make separate VAT Returns</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Tax representatives – what you must do if you appoint one</h3>

<p>When you register for VAT online, you will be asked for information about your tax representative. You’ll need to give your representative enough information to allow them to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep a VAT account</li>
  <li>make returns</li>
  <li>pay VAT</li>
</ul>

<p>on your behalf.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> When HMRC can make you appoint a tax representative</h3>

<p>HMRC can direct some <abbr title="non-established taxable persons">NETPs</abbr> to appoint a tax representative who must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>based in the UK</li>
  <li>fit and proper (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#What-makes-a-tax-representative-fit-and-proper">paragraph 11.4</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We cannot direct <abbr title="non-established taxable persons">NETPs</abbr> who are based in countries where certain mutual assistance arrangements exist.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> What makes a tax representative fit and proper</h3>

<p>A tax representative must meet or exceed a particular level of suitability, compliance and integrity in how they conduct, or appear likely to conduct, their tax affairs with HMRC.</p>

<p>When deciding whether a particular individual is a fit and proper person to act as a VAT representative for an <abbr title="non-established taxable person">NETP</abbr>, HMRC will use the following criteria. A person may not be accepted if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have been disqualified as a director under company law</li>
  <li>are or have been involved in crime and or have relevant criminal convictions, for example, conviction involving dishonesty or deception</li>
  <li>have had previous requests for a similar role in VAT or any other tax or duty regime revoked or refused</li>
  <li>have personally received penalties for deliberate wrongdoing</li>
  <li>have any connection with the business they wish to represent, or with key persons involved in that business, or with any non-compliant or fraudulent businesses</li>
  <li>have fraudulent trading history</li>
  <li>hold no assets and have no insurance</li>
  <li>have not fulfilled their own tax responsibilities, for example not paying their own VAT liabilities or not submitting their personal tax returns</li>
  <li>have outstanding, unmanaged HMRC debts or a history of poor payment</li>
  <li>submit or have previously submitted, an application that is inaccurate and incomplete and is an attempt to deceive, for example the hijacking of another person’s name</li>
  <li>are bankrupt or in a IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive. HMRC may refuse to register you for reasons other than those listed, if they have justifiable concerns about your suitability to be approved as a tax representative.</p>

<p>If HMRC become aware of information that suggests a person may not be a fit and proper person, they may refuse to register them as a tax representative.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> What if the tax representative I have appointed is not fit and proper</h3>

<p>Where HMRC has reason to believe that a tax representative may not be fit and proper, we may cancel their registration as a tax representative.</p>

<p>If we have directed you to appoint a tax representative (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#When-HMRC-can-make">paragraph 11.3</a>), you’ll need to appoint a new representative who is fit and proper.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> When you can appoint an agent instead of a tax representative</h3>

<p>As long as HMRC has not directed you to appoint a tax representative, you can appoint an agent to deal with your UK VAT affairs. Any arrangement you make will be subject to whatever contractual agreement you and your agent decide. We cannot hold your agent responsible for any of your VAT debts. We reserve the right not to deal with any particular agent you may choose to appoint. In some circumstances, if we think it’s necessary, we may still insist that you appoint a tax representative.</p>

<p>As with the appointment of tax representatives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may only appoint one person at a time to act as your agent (although an agent may act for more than one principal)</li>
  <li>you must still fill in the appropriate form to apply for registration (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-to-apply-to-register-for-VAT">paragraph 4.1</a>)</li>
  <li>we’ll need your authority before we can deal with your agent - in the case of agents, the authority should be in a letter. We’ve suggested a form of words at <a class="govuk-link" href="#Letter-to-authorise">paragraph 11.7</a>
</li>
  <li>you’ll need to give your agent enough information to allow them to keep your VAT account, make your returns and pay VAT on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.7 </span> Letter to authorise an agent or employee to act in VAT matters - suggested wording</h3>

<p>(Insert principal’s name) of (insert principal’s address) hereby appoints (insert name of UK agent or employee) of (insert address of UK agent or employee) to act as agent for the purpose of dealing with all their legal obligations in respect of VAT.</p>

<p>This letter authorises the above-named agent to submit VAT Returns and any other document needed for the purpose of enabling the agent or employee to comply with the VAT obligations of the principal.</p>

<p>Signed (insert principal’s signature)</p>

<p>Date (insert date)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.8 </span> If you do not want to appoint a tax representative or an agent</h3>

<p>If you do not want to appoint a tax representative or agent, and HMRC has not directed you to appoint a tax representative, you must meet all your obligations under UK VAT law yourself. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registering for VAT at the correct time</li>
  <li>keeping a record of everything you buy and sell in relation to your business in the UK</li>
  <li>keeping the records needed to complete your VAT Return</li>
  <li>producing records and accounts to HMRC for inspection</li>
  <li>keeping a note of all the VAT you’ve paid and charged for each period covered by your VAT Return</li>
  <li>paying the right amount of tax on time</li>
</ul>

<p>There is more information about keeping records and accounts in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70021-keeping-vat-records">VAT Notice 700/21: keeping VAT records</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> <abbr title="non-established taxable persons">NETPs</abbr> – complying with your VAT obligations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> If you do not register for VAT at the right time</h3>

<p>If you do not register for VAT in the UK when you’re required to, HMRC may register you without your agreement.</p>

<p>We may also charge you a penalty if you fail to tell HMRC at the correct time that you should’ve registered for VAT. You can find more information about registration and the relevant time limits in <a class="govuk-link" href="#How-and-when-to">section 4</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Accounting-for-VAT">section 5</a>.</p>

<p>The amount of the penalty is a percentage of the net VAT due, from the date when you should’ve registered to the date when we either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>received your application</li>
  <li>became fully aware of your need to be registered</li>
</ul>

<p>The percentage varies according to how late you were in registering.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> If you do not meet all of your UK VAT requirements</h3>

<p>If your business does not have a fixed establishment in the UK, and you do not comply with your VAT obligations, HMRC may direct you to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appoint a UK-established, fit and proper VAT representative (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#When-HMRC-can-make">paragraph 11.3</a>)</li>
  <li>require you to pay a financial security</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Overseas sellers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span> Overseas seller – definition</h3>

<p>You’re an overseas seller if you both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sell goods stored in the UK to UK consumers through an online marketplace</li>
  <li>do not have a business establishment in the UK</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span> If you do not meet all of your UK VAT requirements</h3>

<p>HMRC will try to contact you to ask what action you intend to take if you do not meet your VAT requirements. This includes if you do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>register for VAT in the UK</li>
  <li>supply accurate VAT Returns for sales in the UK</li>
  <li>pay the full liability arising from sales in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>There may also be other requirements that you need to meet. If you still do not meet them we’ll contact all the online marketplaces that you’re trading on to inform them that they may be held jointly and severally liable for VAT for any sales you make on them from a specified date.</p>

<p>The marketplace will then decide what it thinks is necessary to protect itself from being pursued by us for your VAT debts. This may include withdrawing permission for you to sell on its website.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> After you register</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.1 </span> Help and information for newly registered businesses</h3>

<p>After you’re registered, HMRC will send you a letter which will explain how you can book a place on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a workshop to introduce you to VAT</li>
  <li>one of our Business Advice Open Days</li>
</ul>

<p>These events are free and will help you understand how VAT works and how it is likely to affect your business. Further information is available from our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries">VAT helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.2 </span> Visits by HMRC’s officers</h3>

<p>From time to time, HMRC may need to inspect your VAT records. This is to make sure that you’ve accounted for the correct amount of tax at the right time. We’ll normally contact you before we visit to arrange a mutually convenient date and time. We occasionally make unannounced visits. If this happens, the attending officer will explain the reason for the visit.</p>

<p>The officer will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carry the visit out as quickly as possible with the minimum of inconvenience to your business</li>
  <li>try to deal with any queries you may wish to raise</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve a business establishment in the UK, we’ll normally visit you there. You’ll need to make your books and trading records available at this address. If you’ve appointed a tax representative or agent, we’ll will normally visit them.</p>

<p>If you do not have a UK business establishment, or have not appointed a tax representative or agent, you’ll need to make your books and trading records available at our Aberdeen VAT office if we ask for them. We’ll examine your records at this office and then return them to you.</p>

<p>You can find more about visits from our officers in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-visits-inspections">VAT visits and inspections</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.3 </span> Change of registration details – what to do</h3>

<p>Please let HMRC know about any changes which affect your VAT registration details. You can find out more about this in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-guide-notice-700">VAT guide (VAT Notice 700)</a>.</p>

<p>You can use our online system to let HMRC know about changes to your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business name</li>
  <li>principal place of business</li>
  <li>bank details</li>
  <li>contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>Or to request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a change of stagger</li>
  <li>deregistration</li>
</ul>

<p>To let HMRC know about any other changes, you should write to our VAT Registration Service at (see address at <a class="govuk-link" href="#List-of-offices">section 17</a>). When you write, remember to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>include your VAT registration number and address</li>
  <li>ensure that the registered person signs the letter (for example, if you’re a sole proprietor, you must sign to confirm the change in details)</li>
</ul>

<p>This will help avoid any delay in recording the new information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span> Change of legal entity – what to do</h3>

<p>If you change the entity of your business, for example, from a sole proprietor to a partnership, you must either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a new registration number</li>
  <li>ask to keep your existing number</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#How-and-when-to">Section 4</a> tells you how to let HMRC know that the new legal entity is liable to be registered.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Errors, late notification and fraud</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> If you get your registration date wrong</h3>

<p>It’s important to get your registration date right.</p>

<p>If HMRC finds out that you should have been registered from an earlier date, you’ll have to pay VAT on the positive-rated taxable supplies you made from that date. We may also charge you a penalty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> If you tell HMRC late</h3>

<p>Once you know you’re liable to register for VAT, it’s important to let HMRC know straightaway.</p>

<p>If you do not let us know by the proper time, we may charge you a penalty which could be equal to the amount of VAT you should have paid us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> If you deliberately avoid registering for VAT</h3>

<p>If you deliberately avoid registering for VAT, you may be liable to a penalty equal to the amount of VAT you should’ve paid. For serious offences, the matter will be investigated and HMRC may bring criminal proceedings against you.</p>
