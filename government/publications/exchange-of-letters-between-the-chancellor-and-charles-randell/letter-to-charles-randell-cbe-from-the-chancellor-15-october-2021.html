<p>Charles Randell CBE
Chairman
Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator
12 Endeavour Square
London
E20 1JN</p>

<p>Dear Charles,</p>

<h4>FCA CHAIR SUCCESSION PLANNING</h4>

<p>Thank you for your letter of 15 October asking me to commence the process to appoint
your successor as Chair of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Payment Systems
Regulator (PSR) and setting out your intention to leave both organisations in Spring 2022.</p>

<p>Both organisations undertake a vital role to ensure that the UK financial markets work well
and that the interests of consumers and users of those markets are protected.</p>

<p>In particular, the FCA was integral in supporting the UK’s departure from the EU with a
minimal disruption to financial services. The FCA is now also playing an important role as
the UK looks to tailor its regulatory approach to financial services to reflect our position
outside the EU, while ensuring that we maintain high regulatory standards.</p>

<p>The FCA also intervened swiftly as part of the wider economic response to the Covid-19
pandemic. Working with industry and the government, this helped ensure payment
holidays on mortgages and credit products were made available to consumers. The FCA
also secured clarity for small businesses with respect to business interruption insurance to
cover pandemic-related losses.</p>

<p>Most significantly, the FCA set in train a multi-year Transformation Programme in 2019 -
implementation and development has accelerated following Nikhil Rathi’s arrival as Chief
Executive last year. A new executive team has been established to lead the organisation,
who are now driving forward the changes necessary to deliver the Programme.</p>

<p>The PSR has also developed its standing as an economic regulator during your tenure as
Chair. During a period of significant change for the payments industry, the PSR has played
an important role in ensuring that there is effective competition in the payment systems
market and has driven forward significant changes in access to the payment systems that
it regulates. The PSR has also played an important role in the future strategy for payment
systems as set out in the recent government response to the Payments Landscape Review.</p>

<p>I am grateful for all that you have done to lead the Boards of both organisations during
this important and extremely challenging period.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>RISHI SUNAK</p>

<p>[Signed]</p>
