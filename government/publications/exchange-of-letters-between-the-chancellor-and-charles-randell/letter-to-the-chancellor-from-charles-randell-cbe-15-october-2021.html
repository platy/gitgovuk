<p>Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP
Chancellor of the Exchequer
HM Treasury
1 Horse Guards Road
London
SW1A 2HQ</p>

<p>15 October 2021</p>

<p>Dear Chancellor,</p>

<p>I am writing to ask you to initiate the process of identifying a successor chair for the Financial
Conduct Authority and the Payment Systems Regulator, with a view to my stepping down in
Spring 2022.</p>

<p>It has been a privilege to chair these organisations through a period when the UK has
reshaped its international regulatory relationships and responded to the challenges of a global
pandemic while the FCA has at the same time put in train a programme of wholesale
transformation.</p>

<p>During this period the FCA has given priority to protecting vulnerable people, including from
unsustainable credit and unfair pricing; overseen the continued delivery of essential financial
services throughout the UK’s withdrawal from the EU; and maintained our position as an
internationally respected regulator, taking the lead in global initiatives such as environmental,
social and governance (ESG) issues, replacing benchmarks like LIBOR and supporting financial
innovation and the competitiveness of our financial services through world-leading
programmes such as the regulatory sandbox. The PSR has brought an important competition
case in the prepaid cards market to a successful conclusion, introduced confirmation of payee
and worked to protect consumers from payment scams.</p>

<p>In 2019 we put in train the wholesale transformation of the FCA to better support consumers
and markets in a fast-changing digital age. We also commissioned three independent reviews
into the past performance of the FCA and its predecessor the FSA, which together cover more
than a decade. We have taken immediate action in response to the recommendations we have
so far received and are embedding the necessary changes through our transformation
programme.</p>

<p>When the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, we showed that this transformation was already
under way, as we acted swiftly to help consumers and businesses.</p>

<p>This summer we published more details of our plans for completing the transformation of the
FCA. I am confident that these plans will realise our ambition to be a more assertive, adaptive
and innovative regulator, and reinforce our commitment to demonstrating the public value we
create. We will be clear about the measurable improvements we aim to deliver in outcomes
for consumers as they use financial services to meet their everyday needs. We will also
redouble our efforts to tackle bad actors, focussing on scams and other financial crimes in the
area we regulate. These are essential foundations for a sustainable, world-leading financial
sector.</p>

<p>Although this transformation is well under way, it will not be complete by the end of my term. It has been a privilege to chair the FCA and PSR during this extraordinary and challenging period and to work with many dedicated and talented public servants. As our newly established executive team begin to roll out their strategies next year to complete the transformation of the FCA, it is the right time to hand over the oversight of the rest of the transformation programme to a chair who can see it through to completion.</p>

<p>Your contribution to decisions about our leadership, to the financial sector policy response to the coronavirus, and to our transformation plans, has been significant. A strong and independent financial conduct regulator with clear and consistent objectives enables the financial sector to grow sustainably by serving the interests of our fellow citizens. I am very grateful for your continuing support of our work.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Charles Randell</p>

<p>Chair</p>
