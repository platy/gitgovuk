<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Summary of grant funding</h2>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (<abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>) intends to provide a grant to a voluntary, community or social enterprise (VCSE) or youth sector organisation, or a joint delivery body led by such an organisation, to act as intermediary grant maker (<abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr>) for the Youth Investment Fund Phase 2 (<abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2), to distribute up to £368 million over three years (2022/23 to 2024/25) to eligible places across England. This represents £288 million of capital funding and up to £80 million of resource funding including for fund delivery. The final selection of an <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will be made by a panel appointed by <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>, using the assessment criteria set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec11">Section 11</a> of this document.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this grant award process, the award for onward grant funding will be approximately £346 million inclusive of irreclaimable VAT (delivery costs not included). The grant recipient will be eligible for an additional resource grant to cover the costs associated with delivery of the <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2. Applicants should outline the amount requested to deliver this funding within the application form and provide a breakdown of these costs. Please justify any anticipated costs that fall outside the typical administration benchmark of 2-6% of the total programme funding awarded.</p>

<h3>Period of funding agreement</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will be expected to start work in summer 2022, with exact dates to be determined in due course.</p>

<p>The grant agreement with the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will be from summer 2022 (date TBC) to the end of the financial year 2024/25, with programme delivery completed and all funding claimed and disbursed by 31 March 2025. The formal agreement is likely to close in June 2025 to account for participation in the final stages of post-event assurance and evaluation. Grant funding from <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> for the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> delivery costs will be paid in arrears in instalments during the 22/23, 23/24 and 24/25 financial years.</p>

<p>Grants cannot be paid out for any work undertaken by any applicant or the notified preferred applicant prior to countersignature of the grant agreement.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will need to submit an interim progress report, with a final report reflecting on grant usage, programme success, and the impact of the activities initiated by the grant funding, no later than 30 June 2025. If an Applicant fails to meet these milestones and/or provides unsatisfactory report[s], <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> reserves the right to require the Applicant to repay all or part of the grant funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The Youth Investment Fund (<abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr>)’s objective is to create, expand and improve local youth facilities and their services, in order to drive positive outcomes for young people, including improved mental and physical wellbeing, and skills for life and work.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> will provide a step change in the provision of safe spaces for all young people. It will provide youth organisations with truly innovative spaces, and allow them to deliver more and better activities to underpin these facilities, reaching more young people. It will achieve savings on facility running costs, benefiting facility operators (and the taxpayer), and enable more resources to be focused on the activities that directly enrich the lives of young people. <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> will help to level the playing field of youth services and facilities, so that young people across the country have equal access to high-quality spaces and activities within their reach.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 1 (21/22)</h3>

<p>In 21/22, £10 million of capital investment is being released for early disbursement into projects that allow organisations to expand or enhance their offer to young people, such that they improve mental and physical wellbeing, and skills for life and work. This funding can also be invested into projects that improve the operational effectiveness and efficiency of organisations working with young people, so that they can focus more resource on their core purpose. <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 1 is being delivered by BBC Children in Need, for completion by 31 March 2022.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 (22/23 to 24/25)</h3>

<p>The Youth Investment Fund Phase 2 will deliver up to 300 facilities that represent positive value for money, are environmentally sustainable and enable positive activities for young people aged 11 to 18 (up to 25 for young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) in eligible places across England, by 2024/25.
The Youth Investment Fund Phase 2 (<abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2) is a commitment to young people to transform and level up the out-of-school youth sector. It will provide truly innovative youth facilities in levelling up priority areas, and early-stage/seed resource funding to underpin them, enabling more positive activities that deliver improved mental and physical wellbeing, and skills for life and work for young people.</p>

<p>This funding will drive value for money facilities that youth organisations can afford to sustain. Utilising modern methods of construction (<abbr title="modern methods of construction">MMC</abbr>) and other innovative construction techniques, as well as supporting redevelopment projects that expand youth service provision, the <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> will achieve savings on facility running costs, benefiting operators — and the taxpayer — so that resources can focus on activities that enrich young people’s lives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Timetable</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Due to the need for the full £368 million of funding to be delivered by the end of the 2024/25 financial year, delivery at pace is critical, and the provisional timetable for delivery of onward grants below reflects this.</p>
</div>

<p>All funding must be distributed by the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> to VCSE, youth sector or local authority organisations by 31 March 2025.</p>

<p>Resource funding to deliver the <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 should also be claimed by 31 March 2025. Any uncommitted funds must be returned to <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> within three months of programme closure, by 30 June 2025.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr>’s objective is to create, expand and improve local youth facilities and their services, in order to drive positive outcomes for young people, including improved mental and physical wellbeing, and skills for life and work.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 is a commitment to young people to transform and level up the out-of-school youth sector. It will provide truly innovative youth facilities in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-investment-fund-yif-places-selection-methodology">eligible places</a>, and early-stage/seed resource funding to underpin them, enabling more positive activities that deliver improved health and wellbeing and skills for work and life for young people.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 will work with eligible places in England to level up youth provision, assessing and distributing grants to deliver the indicative fund objectives below, subject to demand. Please note that these objectives are still being shaped and may be subject to some change.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The YIF Phase 2 will:</strong></p>

<ol class="steps">

<p>Provide new and redeveloped facilities delivering positive activities to young people, funded through self-reliant funding models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the environmental sustainability of the youth sector estate in target areas through energy efficiencies and/or low carbon heating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce the environmental impact of construction activities across the programme, by funding facilities with the lowest reasonable carbon footprint across their lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce build and ongoing running costs, by supporting new or redeveloped youth facilities that demonstrate 20% reduced annual running costs by 2025/26, compared to ageing youth facilities.</p>
</li>

<p>The <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will be responsible for assessing and distributing capital and resource grants of approximately £346 million (not including costs for <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> delivery) to youth sector organisations, VCSEs and local authorities. The breakdown of onward grant funding per financial year is still subject to change and government financial planning. However, to help with applicants’ resource planning, we expect administrative work to be front-loaded for setup of the programme, and onward grant payments to be back-loaded.</p>

<p>We estimate that the majority of capital grants will be between £300,000 and £8.7 million, with around 300 capital grants awarded and resource grants linked to these. This is subject to the volume and quality of applications.</p>

<p>Applicants to the <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 are expected to be youth or VCSE organisations or local authorities.</p>

<p>Onward grants distributed by the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> must be viable for delivery between 22/23 and 24/25 financial years, with all funding disbursed by 31 March 2025. Capital grants may include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large new youth centres/zones, with multiple rooms, including outdoor space and full youth facilities</li>
  <li>medium new youth centres, with one or more rooms/spaces and uses for youth services/activities</li>
  <li>small new modular youth units, using modern methods of construction, or other innovative and efficient construction techniques, consisting of a single main space for smaller youth services/activities</li>
  <li>repurposing of existing facilities, including preserving or reinstating disused or derelict spaces for use as youth centres, where renovation work will expand the capacity, inclusivity or quality of services being offered to young people</li>
  <li>expansion or extension of existing facilities used for youth services/activities, where renovation work will expand the capacity, inclusivity or quality of services being offered to young people</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Repairs, maintenance or cosmetic works that do not expand the capacity, inclusivity or quality of services being offered, or do not prevent a facility from falling into disuse, will not be eligible for capital funding.</p>
</div>

<p>Resource grants must create, expand or improve local youth services/activities from <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr>’s capital-funded facilities, enabling more positive activities that deliver improved mental and physical wellbeing, and skills for life and work for young people. Resource grants should be used as early-stage or seed funding for youth activities from new or redeveloped youth facilities, to ensure that facilities drive these positive outcomes for young people, and to help enable youth organisations to develop sustainable funding models.</p>

<p>It is essential to recognise funded activity in the period it occurs and within the allocated annual budget profiles. All projects will need to be completed or be unreliant on <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> funding beyond 31 March 2025.</p>

<p>We expect the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> to deliver multiple rounds of funding, up to four per year, between 22/23 and 24/25.</p>

<p>Performance will be measured and reported frequently against the following <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>:</p>

<span class="number">6. </span> Eligibility criteria of applicants</h2>

<p>VCSE sector or youth sector organisations are encouraged to apply for this role. Applicants may apply as a single organisation with or without delivery partners, or may alternatively submit a joint application (for example, as a consortium, joint venture, unincorporated association, partnership or otherwise). This may, for example, apply to entities who feel that alone they do not have the capacity or capability to address the size and scale of the department’s requirement, or wish to bring in additional expertise to meet the department’s required skills and experience for this role. Applicants are responsible for determining the most appropriate approach to delivering their proposal.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>The following additional information applies to applicants who put forward a joint approach:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A lead party must be identified that shall submit an application on behalf of all parties to the joint application.</li>

Where the joint application is proposing to create a separate legal entity, such as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or consortium, they should provide details of the actual or proposed percentage shareholding of the constituent members within the new entity and details of its legal and operational structure. An SPV is a legal entity that is formed to perform a specific contract.</li>
  <li>The applicant must submit written confirmation from each party that they authorise the lead party organisation to act on their behalf in relation to this grant competition.</li>
  <li>If awarded a grant, unless otherwise stated in your application, each of the Parties shall be jointly and severally responsible for the due performance of any grant agreement with the department.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Applicants must advise the department if there is any change to their legal status and/or composition during or after the appointment process, and the department reserves the right to disqualify applicants where significant or material changes occur.</p>

  <li>England-wide reach, with existing local, regional or place-based connections to facilitate local engagement with stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Ability to engage with construction consultants with <abbr title="modern methods of construction">MMC</abbr> expertise, to facilitate use of a supplier framework by onward grant applicants for purchase of standard modular builds.</li>
  <li>Existing counter-fraud processes/protocols (such as fraud risk assessments, fraud, bribery and corruption due diligence, and post event assurance), and experience managing counter-fraud processes, particularly with construction projects.</li>
  <li>Experience of communications around large grant funding programmes, including publicising programmes, creating resources/workshops, and providing support to applicants to generate demand, build capacity, network/develop partnerships, and attract high-quality applications.</li>
  <li>Experience securing and managing external match funding sources and/or partners for grant funding programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Desirable requirements:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Experience working with facilities using modern methods of construction (<abbr title="modern methods of construction">MMC</abbr>) and other innovative construction techniques.</li>

<p><strong>Value Added Tax.</strong> The grant offer will be made on the basis that the costs presented to the department take account of all VAT liabilities. If it is later found that the project costs increase because an error has been made about whether VAT can be recovered, <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> will not increase your grant to cover this. If the applicant is, after all, able to recover VAT, which it had included in the costs put forward to <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>, the applicant will be liable to repay all or some of the amount it recovers to <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> may seek to recover some or all of the grant, if the applicant is performing unsatisfactorily or if the project ceases activity. <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> may not require all or part of the grant to be repaid where the reasons for unsatisfactory performance or early cessation of work are beyond the control of the applicant and reasonably unforeseen by the applicant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Monitoring and evaluation</h2>

<p>An independent evaluation of the <abbr title="Youth Investment Fund">YIF</abbr> Phase 2 will be undertaken and an external research organisation will be commissioned to undertake this. It will be a comprehensive evaluation that will assess the process, impact and value for money of the programme. There will also be elements of reporting on the monitoring of the fund. The overall aim of the evaluation will be to explore the progress of the benefits and impact of the fund to the youth sector, young people and wider society.</p>

<p>The impact part of the evaluation will aim to use robust evaluation methodology either through randomised control trials or quasi-experimental methodology, where possible. The methodology for the evaluation will be explored in a feasibility study which is likely to report to <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> in the summer of 2022, and then be used to develop specific plans for the full evaluation.</p>

<p>Once an evaluation partner is in place, the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will need to work with the chosen research organisation to help inform the evaluation plan in conjunction with <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>. This plan will focus on how robust data will be collected to demonstrate how the fund has been delivered, its effectiveness, and to gather impact data from young people etc. It will also set out the timeline for the evaluation and key milestones.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will need to work closely with the research organisation to help deliver the evaluation. It is expected that a research organisation will be appointed and will set up the evaluation in the autumn of 2022. While a research organisation is being appointed, it will be expected that the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will work closely with <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> to make sure that relevant data that is needed for the evaluation is collected during the application stage for round 1 of funding, and also that onward grantees know what to expect in terms of their involvement in the evaluation process, which will be mandatory for all grant holders.</p>

<p>There will be a range of data the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> and onward grant recipients will need to provide to the appointed research organisation. For the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr>, this will include the application data for all applicants to the fund, data on successful applications (e.g. which organisations received funds, how much funding etc) and project monitoring data. All data from the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will need to be provided to the evaluators in an easily accessible format e.g. Excel spreadsheets. For onward grant recipients, this is still to be determined but will likely include data on services/activities being provided and attendance, personal data about young people attending services, data on running costs of facilities, data on any match funding, and any other data around the fund deemed to be relevant. The appointed evaluator will work with the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> to determine how this data will be collected and any further needs of data collection.</p>

<p>It will also be expected that the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will provide contact details of organisations who receive funding so they can take part in follow-up research for the evaluation. This will need to be made clear to recipients of the funding and the data protection issues around this made clear to recipients. The <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will also be required to formally take part in research activity (e.g. be interviewed by the research organisation to inform the findings from the evaluation), particularly for the process evaluation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Performance reporting and responsibilities</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will produce regular progress reports for <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr>. The frequency of reporting will be agreed with the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> upon appointment and will be specified within the full grant agreement.</p>

<p>By 30 June 2025, the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will provide an end of project report to <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> confirming that the grant outputs have been delivered to a satisfactory standard and the expected benefits that have accrued or will accrue. This report should reflect on grant usage, programme success, and the impact of the activities initiated by the grant funding. This final report must highlight any best practice or lessons learned. It should cover activities for the full grant period, 2022/23 to 2024/25.</p>

<p>No later than 3 months from the end of the grant period, the <abbr title="intermediary grant maker">IGM</abbr> will provide <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport">DCMS</abbr> with a statement of grant usage that has been audited by an independent accountant and a final financial statement detailing the use of the grant funding.</p>
