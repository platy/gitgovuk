<p>Car clubs allow users to access a vehicle without owning one and can offer a flexible, convenient alternative to private car ownership or leasing. As car club vehicles are often newer, they tend to have lower emissions than private cars, which helps to reduce carbon emissions and air pollution.</p>

<p>For local authorities, car clubs can help deliver against wide-ranging objectives which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>achieving net zero targets</li>
  <li>improving air quality and vehicle occupancy rates</li>
  <li>reducing parking pressures and congestion</li>
  <li>offering a sustainable transport option that works alongside and can fill gaps in public transport provision</li>
</ul>

<p>Local authorities can ensure policies and interventions supporting car clubs are integrated with wider local transport and net zero strategies. Councils can also have an enabling role in introducing or expanding car club operations through procuring a car club for residents, businesses or council staff.</p>

<p>Local authorities are well placed to facilitate parking and&nbsp;electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>)&nbsp;charging for car clubs as part of a wider integrated transport system. A report for Transport and Environment on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/shared-vision-tackling-the-barriers-to-electric-car-clubs-in-the-uk/" rel="external">barriers and opportunities for electric vehicles</a> includes a set of recommendations for local authorities on electric vehicle car club take up.</p>

<h2>Types of car club</h2>

<p>Car clubs provide residents, visitors or businesses with access to a vehicle, often as a short-term rental by the hour. Within car clubs, vehicles include cars as well as vans. Updated lists of car clubs are available to view on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/who/" rel="external">CoMoUK website</a>.</p>

<p>Car clubs can be categorised into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commercial car clubs run by commercial operators (such as&nbsp;Co-Wheels,&nbsp;Enterprise,&nbsp;Hertz,&nbsp;Ubeeqo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Zipcar) who manage the vehicle tax, insurance and maintenance and may cover fuel costs â typically, members pay a monthly or annual fee and an hourly rate to hire a vehicle</li>
  <li>community car clubs run by local groups (such as&nbsp;Derwent Valley Car Club) â these include informally arranged clubs, independent car clubs and those operating under licence from a national operator</li>
  <li>peer-to-peer car sharing platforms (such as&nbsp;Getaround,&nbsp;Hiyacar,&nbsp;Karshare&nbsp;and&nbsp;Turo), which allow people with under-used vehicles to rent them to users locally through a dedicated platform â the platform providers often take a commission and provide insurance cover, some also operate traditional car club fleets or support community schemes with telematics</li>
</ul>

<p>Car clubs operate in 3 primary ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Back to base â a traditional car club scheme, where a user books the car, picks it up from a dedicated parking bay, drives it and returns to the start location at the end of their hire.</li>
  <li>One-way â an emerging variation on the traditional scheme, this allows users to pick up a car within a defined zone and drop it off elsewhere in the zone in an approved location (an example of like this is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zipcar.com/en-gb" rel="external">Zipcar Flex</a> in London).</li>
  <li>Geofenced â also known as âback to areaâ, this scheme uses geofencing technology to ensure that a user leaves the car within a certain geofenced area, so that other members in the zone can access the vehicle, without it having to be returned to a dedicated parking bay â <a class="govuk-link" href="https://faq-gb.ubeeqo.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44001805954-what-is-the-difference-between-geofence-and-fixed-bay-parking-and-how-do-i-know-which-one-is-which-" rel="external">Ubeeqo</a> explains the difference between fixed bays and geofenced areas.</li>
</ol>

<p>Findings from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://share-north.eu/2019/03/catch-up-on-webinar-the-impact-of-different-car-sharing-variations-on-urban-mobility/" rel="external">Shared mobility opporTunities And challenges foR European citieS</a> (<abbr title="Shared mobility opporTunities And challenges foR European citieS">STARS</abbr>) project show how different types of car clubs suit different localities and journey patterns. The project found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>round trip car clubs were used primarily for longer trips (up to several hours)</li>
  <li>âfree-floatingâ (one way) hire variants were equivalent to how people use private cars</li>
  <li>the one-way model was used in parallel to owning a private car</li>
  <li>to replace the greatest number of private cars taking journeys, one way models (for longer trips) and round-trip models (for shorter trips) were both needed in a location</li>
</ul>

<p>Some informal car club operating models are similar to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lift-sharing-local-authority-toolkit">lift sharing</a>  â where drivers and passengers with similar routes share a single vehicle, rather than driving separately.</p>

<h2>The benefits of car clubs</h2>

<p>By providing an alternative to driving a private car, car clubs reduce carbon emissions, air pollution, parking pressure and congestion, while supporting the shift to lower carbon forms of travel.</p>

<p>CoMoUK is the national organisation for shared transport. As a charity for the public benefit, it offers free, extensive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">guidelines for local authorities on car clubs</a>, including car club procurement guidance.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/why/" rel="external">CoMoUKâs 2020 summary report</a> draws on surveys of members and operators and outlines the positive impact of car clubs. Twenty percent of respondents said they couldnât afford to own a car and this was their reason for joining a car club. Those interviewed also reported cost savings against car ownership up to Â£1,000 in a year.</p>

<p>In a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">2022 CoMoUK report</a>, research shows that each car club vehicle on average can replace 18 private cars.</p>

<p>Element Energyâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/shared-vision-tackling-the-barriers-to-electric-car-clubs-in-the-uk/" rel="external">2021 report for Transport &amp; Environment</a> also identified some car club benefits and barriers to adoption.</p>

<h3>How car clubs reduce carbon emissions</h3>

<p>Transferring mileage to car club vehicles reduces tailpipe emissions, with the average UK car club vehicle producing approximately a quarter less emissions than the average privately owned vehicle, according to CoMoUKâs 2020 summary report. This is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on average, the age of car club vehicles is 1.6 years, compared to 8 years for private ownership â leading to emission savings as standards are tightened over time</li>
  <li>car clubs have a higher proportion of hybrid and zero emission vehicles â battery&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>&nbsp;make up 11% of the current UK car club fleet, compared to 1% of private vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>To maximise the reduction in tailpipe emissions, local authorities should give consideration to increasing the proportion of&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>&nbsp;in the fleet when procuring a car club operator. Several operators have ambitious plans to switch to electric vehicles. For example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zipcar.com/en-gb/flex/electric" rel="external">Zipcar</a> is aiming for their whole fleet to be electric by 2025.</p>

<p>Car clubs can also open up access to <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> as they provide more affordable and sustainable access to electric vehicles.</p>

<h3>How car clubs promote changes in use of transport</h3>

<p>Not all journeys that would have taken place in a private car transfer to car club vehicles. However, when used, car clubs can also reduce carbon emissions through changing travel behaviour.</p>

<p>By putting a direct cost and adding a small element of extra effort (for example, getting to a car club vehicle, even if this only takes a minute) on using any vehicle for a particular journey, car clubs can also encourage a shift to active and public transport for shorter journeys and incentivise trip chaining to make use as efficient as possible. Many members use car club vehicles for trips where public transport is not viable (such as unsociable hours or night shift workers), or when needing to move bulky items, for instance.</p>

<p>Car club users reported a decrease in mileage completed in private vehicles because of car club membership. In 2018, CoMoUK reported a net average decrease of 620 miles for users in London and 793 miles for users across England and Wales. This net figure accounts for an increase in mileage from users who did not own a car and those users who decreased use through not using a private car.</p>

<p>In 2020, CoMoUK found that car club members showed higher than average use of public and sustainable transport modes â with 30% using a bike 3 times a week, compared to a national average of 14% using a bike more than once. Bike parking next to dedicated car club bays can also provide improved access for users.</p>

<p>Car club vehicles tend to have higher occupancy rates than private cars, helping to reduce congestion and displace additional road journeys.</p>

<p>As highlighted by the governmentâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan">Transport decarbonisation plan</a>, even small increases in occupancy rates can generate significant carbon savings. In 2016 to 2017, London car club vehicles had an average occupancy of 2 people, compared to an average of 1.6 for private cars, according to CoMoUKâs 2017 to 2018 annual car club survey for London. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lift-sharing-local-authority-toolkit">Lift sharing</a> can also increase vehicle occupancy levels.</p>

<p>CoMoUK estimate that up to 18 vehicles are taken off the road by each car club vehicle. Some users may directly exchange their car for car club membership, while others may replace a second household car, decide against, or delay a private vehicle purchase or lease.</p>

<p>Research by CoMoUK showed that 22% of users surveyed would have bought a car if they had not joined a car club and 21% owned one car fewer after joining.</p>

<h3>Additional benefits beyond decarbonisation</h3>

<p>By providing a flexible alternative to private car ownership, car clubs can deliver wider benefits for local authorities and communities, in addition to decarbonising transport.</p>

<h4>Benefits for local authority policy</h4>

<p>Car clubs can benefit local authorities by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing tailpipe emissions from air pollutants (<abbr title="nitrous oxide">NOx</abbr>&nbsp;and particulate matter) resulting in better health outcomes â car club vehicles have 89% lower&nbsp;<abbr title="nitrous oxide">NOx</abbr>&nbsp;and 72% lower&nbsp;<abbr title="fine particulate matter">PM2.5</abbr>&nbsp;emissions than average UK cars according to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/why/" rel="external">CoMoUKâs 2020 report on car clubs in Great Britain</a>
</li>
  <li>reducing demand for residential parking spaces â <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.racfoundation.org/research/mobility/still-standing-still" rel="external">research by the RAC Foundation</a> found that the average vehicle spends over 70% of the time parked at home, a usage pattern that has changed very little in over 25 years â fewer parked cars on the road can contribute to improvements in public spaces</li>
  <li>encouraging the release of brownfield land for redevelopment â where developments include car clubs, less space is required for parking, which allows for the inclusion of more shared amenity space and for the development of sites previously thought too small, because they lacked space for parking</li>
</ul>

<h4>Benefits for users and communities</h4>

<p>Car clubs can benefit users and communities by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling access to newer, more environmentally friendly vehicles</li>
  <li>removing the costs and hassle of vehicle ownership (including certain requirements associated with tax, MOT, fuel, insurance, servicing and repairs)</li>
  <li>allowing people to avoid vehicle depreciation costs</li>
  <li>decreasing household parking expenses</li>
  <li>helping users to try&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>&nbsp;without needing them to purchase one</li>
  <li>providing access to employment opportunities and services where public transport is less viable</li>
  <li>allowing access to a choice of vehicles to suit the requirements of a particular journey</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions for local authorities</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Procure a car club operator</h2>

<p>Procuring a car club operator is a positive action that local authorities can take, signalling a commitment to deliver net zero.</p>

<h3>Considerations when procuring a car club operator</h3>

<p>To maximise the impact on carbon emissions, the government encourages local authorities to specify electric vehicles in the car club requirements and/or include criteria to evaluate operators on the extent their proposed schemes will deliver emission reductions, supported by evidence.</p>

<p>CoMoUKâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">guidance on car club procurement</a> offers detailed, free advice for local authorities. The extent of the councilâs influence on operational decisions will depend on any funding provided and how much risk the operator is being asked to take on.</p>

<p>In summary, local authorities can choose between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a concession agreement â where a supplier is invited to operate and receive all the revenue from a scheme, without being funded by the local authority â in this scenario the council has less control over operations and gives the operator permission to generate revenue on council land by providing parking bays</li>
  <li>a services arrangement â where a local authority procures a specific service and contributes funding to the scheme (for example, through the operator charging the council a management or operating fee) â in this scenario the local authority has more control over the schemeâs operation</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, local authorities need to specify the contract length, operational model (for example, back to base, one-way or geofenced) and if one or multiple operators will be appointed, either at the contract outset or later on.</p>

<h3>Data sharing</h3>

<p>Local authorities may wish to include requirements on data reporting in their procurement specification. Due to the on-board vehicle telematics and booking process, car club vehicles generate detailed and potentially highly useful data on journey patterns.</p>

<p>To standardise data flows, provide robust evidence for transport planning and better coordinate councils and car club operators, London Councils has developed a data sharing framework for use by boroughs. London Councils is currently developing a use case for the data sharing framework to allow it to be integrated into procurement requirements. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.racfoundation.org/media-centre/new-data-framework-looks-to-accelerate-car-club-use" rel="external">proposed framework</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.racfoundation.org/data-driven/car-club-data" rel="external">car club data webinar</a> recording could also be adopted by local authorities outside the capital.</p>

<h3>Accredited car club operators</h3>

<p>Local authorities should consider whether to include accreditation as a requirement for a successful bidder. This may be appropriate when tendering larger opportunities but may exclude smaller or community-based operators.</p>

<p>The accrediting body for car clubs in the UK is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/accreditation/" rel="external">CoMoUK</a>. Accredited operators must provide evidence that they meet a set of criteria, covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>business requirements â organisational structure, annual reporting and environmental standards</li>
  <li>service provision â pricing structure, vehicle and environmental safety, cleanliness standards and emergency contact procedures</li>
  <li>safety requirements â insurance, deposits, servicing and maintenance, breakdown cover, user handbooks, complaints and data security</li>
  <li>data collection â to feed into CoMoUK annual reporting, covering members, operators, emissions analysis and vehicle metrics</li>
</ul>

<p>Standards are checked at least annually by CoMoUK as part of re-accreditation and may be checked throughout the year to ensure continued compliance.</p>

<h3>Funding and subsidy control</h3>

<p>There is currently no central government fund dedicated to supporting car clubs. However, government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants">grants for plug in vehicles</a> will often help with the purchase of electric vehicles for car clubs and local authorities have access to funding for public charging infrastructure, which car club cars may access.</p>

<p>In Scotland, funding to support electric car club development may be available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/grants-and-loans/plugged-communities-grant-fund/" rel="external">Plugged-in Communities Grant Fund</a>. Funding can help housing associations and co-operatives as well as constituted community groups to procure a zero-emissions car club vehicle for use of the tenants and the wider community. For more information, visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/grants-and-loans/plugged-communities-grant-fund/" rel="external">Energy Saving Trust website</a>.</p>

<p>Where a local authority is looking to use public funds to support a charging solution for&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>&nbsp;in a car club, it should consider matters relating to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments">subsidy control</a>. Where the charging infrastructure supported is publicly accessible and not dedicated to the car club (for example, if car club users are directed towards public charging provision), then additional subsidy control considerations do not apply.</p>

<p>If the public funding is to support dedicated bays for the car club, then subsidy control considerations do apply, however, these can likely be satisfied if the car club was appointed through a competitive tender or there is a clear need for public funding support. It is down to local authorities to ensure they have considered and satisfied these elements and they should consult the subsidy control guidance accordingly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Provide access to parking</h2>

<p>Local authorities have an essential role in providing car clubs with access to parking bays, ensuring the smooth operation of the car club and convenience for users.</p>

<p>If the car club is going to operate from fixed, dedicated parking bays, traffic regulation orders (<abbr title="Traffic Regulation Orders">TROs</abbr>) will need to be amended to re-designate bays for exclusive car club use. Guidance on engaging with affected parties ahead of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Traffic Regulation Order">TRO</abbr>&nbsp;consultation process can be found in CoMoUKâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">community engagement plan</a>.</p>

<p>For electric car clubs, vehicles will need regular access to chargepoints. Depending on the providerâs operating model, this may be in bays dedicated for car club use, either on-street or in a car park through a <abbr title="Traffic Regulation Order">TRO</abbr>, or through access to a network of rapid chargers.</p>

<p>To support the financial viability of a car club, local authorities can remove or reduce parking permit application fees for car club vehicles or introduce a new type of permit to allow multiple car club vehicles to park in an area. For example, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/parking-and-travel/parking/car-club-bays" rel="external">Brighton</a> car club parking permit fees are significantly reduced.</p>

<h4>Implementing car clubs: Flexible car club parking in Lewisham</h4>

<p>Type of car club â urban, flexible vehicles.</p>

<p>The London Borough of <a class="govuk-link" href="https:/lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/roads-and-transport/sustainable-transport/car-clubs">Lewisham</a> created a âfloatingâ car club permit to allow a set number of car club vehicles to park in permit-controlled spaces across the borough. These permits allow car club vehicles to park in the borough, up to a maximum number assigned to the operator. This is reviewed annually and increased or decreased based on operator performance.</p>

<h4>Implementing car clubs: London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</h4>

<p>Type of car club â urban, mix of back to base, one way and flexible one-way vehicles.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/parking-transport-and-streets/managing-traffic-and-transport/car-clubs" rel="external">London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</a> now has over 210 dedicated car club bays, in addition to provision for one-way flexible services and round trip geofenced parking areas.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of car clubs into the borough, the council has worked to progressively expand the number of vehicles available to residents. It now has 4 operators providing a range of car sharing options across the borough.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Provide access to&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;charging infrastructure</h2>

<p>Working with car club operators, chargepoint operators and distribution network operators (<abbr title="distribution network operators">DNOs</abbr>) will be important to enable appropriate provision of charging infrastructure for electric car club vehicles.</p>

<p>As with all&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoint installations, early engagement with the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;will allow an authority to understand local grid constraints and the potential upgrade costs to enable different numbers of chargepoints and speeds of charging.</p>

<h3>Engage with car club operators</h3>

<p>Engaging with existing car club operators will allow an understanding of their fleet upgrade and replacement plans, which will inform the deployment of&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;charging provision for existing car club vehicles. If the operator already has some&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr>&nbsp;in their fleet, their charging strategy can inform how additional charging capacity is deployed.</p>

<p>If an authority is procuring a new car club service, it is encouraged to specify that a proportion of the vehicles must be zero emission. Depending on the availability of existing chargepoint provision, grid constraints and operatorsâ business models, it may not be possible to supply all vehicles as zero emission initially. In this case, authorities should consider a phased approach over the life of the contract.</p>

<h4>Implementing car clubs: electric vehicles and charging infrastructure in London</h4>

<p>Types of car club: urban, back to base and flexible.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.zipcar.com/en-gb/flex" rel="external">Zipcar flex fleet</a> comprises 30% EVs, but does not require recharging by users. Instead, when a vehicleâs charge level drops below 20%, it is no longer available for hire through the app. A Zipcar driver will be notified to take it to a nearby rapid chargepoint to top up and return the vehicle to a parking space, ready for the next hire.</p>

<p>In Waltham Forest, the authority used funding from Go Ultra Low Cities to install chargepoints in 6 designated car club bays.</p>
</div>

<h3>Engage with chargepoint operators</h3>

<p>If the authority has already procured an&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoint supplier, it may be able to supply chargepoints for car club use. Car club operators may not want ownership of any chargepoints installed at fixed bays themselves as, in most cases, they do not own the bay.</p>

<p>To ensure&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;charging provision for car clubs matches demand, authorities may want to include provision for regularly monitoring and reporting usage of car club-only chargepoints specifically in its&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoint procurement. This would enable the operator, the council and the car club provider to assess usage and request additional chargepoints as needed according to a defined set of criteria, such as where car cub charger usage matches or exceeds public chargepoint usage.</p>

<h4>Implementing car clubs: electric vehicles and charging infrastructure in Devon</h4>

<p>Type of car club: urban and rural, back to base.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.co-cars.co.uk/" rel="external">Co Cars</a> is part of a shared mobility service operating from 5 town locations across the south-west. It also operates e-bike and e-cargo bike hire, as well as an EV charger sharing platform. Co Cars works in partnership with local authorities and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://rapidchargingdevon.co.uk/" rel="external">Rapid Charging Devon</a> to designate parking bays and install EV infrastructure to support their fleet and for public use.</p>
</div>

<p>This may be different for community car clubs where the local authority is less involved, such as in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ourgateshead.org/derwent-valley-car-club" rel="external">Derwent Valley</a>, where the car club owns and operates the chargepoint. A similar approach is being taken by a new community electric car club in Brighton who are paying for the installation of chargepoints, with the council supporting through designating bays.</p>

<p>For more information on&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;charging infrastructure, an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-help-for-local-authorities">online hub for local authorities on&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;charging infrastructure</a> is available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Engage with council teams, residents and businesses</h2>

<p>CoMoUK <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">guidance on car clubs and councils</a> outlines which council teams and decision-makers should be involved for both public and staff travel schemes.</p>

<p>In addition to parking and fleet managers, it will be important to engage with enforcement teams to ensure they are clear on the expectations of&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;drivers and car club&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;users when using a charging point (for example, if the vehicle must be plugged in and charging when in an&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;bay).</p>

<p>Local authorities need to identify stakeholders and engage early with the community where car club vehicles are planned to manage expectations, build trust and address potential concerns.</p>

<p>Local authorities should use their marketing and communications teams to engage with residents in advance of implementing a car club.</p>

<p>Community engagement will be most successful when working with a car club provider to demonstrate the benefits of membership and offering incentives for residents to try the service.</p>

<p>Engagement with businesses will also support car club development. Businesses have different usage pattern to residents and require vehicles at different times, increasing usership of the car club while cutting business travel costs.</p>

<p>Engagement with chambers of commerce, industrial estates, business improvement districts and similar groups will help increase uptake and to identify any business needs, different vehicle types and specifications, which can then be fed back to a car club provider.</p>

<p>CoMoUK has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">guidance on community engagement and a business action kit</a>, that include suggested approaches and recommended messages to communicate with groups.</p>

<p>In addition, the governmentâs 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shared-mobility-user-attitudes">shared mobility report</a> report examines peopleâs motivation for and barriers to, using car clubs.</p>

<h3>Increase demand in rural areas</h3>

<p>All local authorities will need to consider the expected demand for car clubs, ensuring the commercial case works for their area, including urban and rural communities.</p>

<p>In more dispersed communities, a community car club may be more appropriate to serve residentsâ needs due to having closer links with the population. A local authority can help to set up and promote the community car club to ensure it is integrated with other transport or community hubs. Placing vehicles at community hubs, such as village halls, is also likely to encourage sign ups.</p>

<p>Councils can provide support by making funding available for feasibility studies and working with lower-tier authorities to develop the scheme. Councils can also provide links with chargepoint operators and parking contractors, and they can help with communications support.</p>

<h4>Implementing car clubs in rural areas: community car clubs</h4>

<p>Type of car club: rural, community, back to base.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ourgateshead.org/derwent-valley-car-club" rel="external">Derwent Valley car club</a> in Gateshead was set up in 2013 with the help of a National Lottery grant.</p>

<p>It was one of the first EV only car clubs in the country, based at a community hall. Funding covered the initial set up of the club and additional funding from DfT and Carplus (now CoMoUK) funded a feasibility study that confirmed demand for the expansion of the car club.</p>

<p>The club now has 3 vehicles across multiple locations and offers a volunteer driver service in addition to car club provision.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Introduce car clubs at new developments</h2>

<p>Car clubs can be implemented in new developments (including housing schemes) to support low car neighbourhoods and reduce the need for car parking. CoMoUK have produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-cars/how/" rel="external">guidance on promoting low car neighbourhoods in Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>In England, authorities can make use of section 106 obligations to require developers to establish a car club, either as a direct contribution towards car club set-up and operating costs, via a contribution to the local authority for sustainable transport initiatives. This may include car club provision, or to directly cover the costs of a&nbsp;<abbr title="Traffic Regulation Order">TRO</abbr>&nbsp;for a car club bay. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-infrastructure-levy">Community Infrastructure Levy</a> funds can also be used.</p>

<h3>Implementing car clubs: Bath Riverside development</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transportfornewhomes.org.uk/transport-for-new-homes-award-bath-riverside/" rel="external">Bath Riverside</a> was designed to promote sustainable travel options and residents are offered incentives to take up walking and cycling, join the car club or use public transport. The development is well served by buses and residents are offered a one month free bus pass, free car club membership and a Â£100 cycle voucher.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/local-plan-core-strategy-and-placemaking-plan-partial-update/policy-sb8-bath-riverside" rel="external">Bath and North East Somerset Council</a> included the Bath Riverside development in its local plan site allocations. Developers then made provision for sustainable travel and car clubs on site, with Enterprise providing the car club.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Procure a car club for council staff travel</h2>

<p>Car clubs can also be procured for use by council staff as an alternative to grey fleet mileage (personal cars used for work purposes) and to complement pool cars.</p>

<p>These vehicles may be for the sole use of council employees or shared with the public at specific times or days, such as in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.uk100.org/projects/knowledgehub/co-wheels-car-club-scheme" rel="external">Lancaster</a>. Sharing use can increase vehicle utilisation rates and improve the financial viability for operators. As with other types of car clubs, local authorities could require or encourage use of electric vehicles. Energy Saving Trust offers guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/service/manage-business-travel-and-grey-fleet-use/" rel="external">managing business travel</a>.</p>

<h4>Implementing EV car clubs: Lancaster City Council</h4>

<p>Type of car club: urban, back to base.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.uk100.org/projects/knowledgehub/co-wheels-car-club-scheme" rel="external">Lancaster City Council</a> is working with Co-Wheels to expand its EV fleet across the city. During business hours, the council will use the vehicles, to reduce business mileage and emissions. In off-peak hours, the vehicles will be available to the public.</p>

<p>The council has invested Â£114,000 in 6 EVs, paid for through capital borrowing, to be paid back through expected decreases in business mileage claims. It has also invested in improving the cityâs EV infrastructure to support the new fleet. The council is expecting emissions from business mileage to decrease by 95% by March 2023, compared to March 2021.</p>
