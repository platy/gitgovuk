<p>You should follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">how to stop the spread of coronavirus</a> at all times.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the additional steps you should consider to reduce the risk of catching or passing on COVID-19. This guidance is for people living in all types of housing, in particular for people who live in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accommodation with shared facilities, such as a block of flats</li>
  <li>overcrowded accommodation</li>
  <li>shared accommodation</li>
</ul>

<p>Shared accommodation could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a flat or house share where tenants live with another person with whom they are not related and share cooking and bathroom facilities</li>
  <li>a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO), which is where 3 or more people from 2 or more different families share cooking or bathroom facilities</li>
  <li>co-living where multiple people/households share some facilities or common areas</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance applies to those who rent their accommodation, and people who own their accommodation. There is additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants">guidance for landlords and tenants</a>.</p>

<h2>How to minimise the spread of infection, particularly if you live with other people in shared accommodation</h2>

<p>COVID-19 spreads from person to person through small droplets, aerosols and through direct contact. Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with COVID-19 when people with the infection cough or sneeze or touch them. The risk of spread is greatest when people are close to each other, especially in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and when people spend a lot of time together in the same room.</p>

<p>It will be difficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash their hands more frequently, for 20 seconds, with soap and water or use hand sanitiser and avoid touching their face</li>
  <li>regularly clean frequently touched surfaces</li>
  <li>make sure you let plenty of fresh air into your home</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance for households with possible COVID-19 infection</a> contains more detailed guidance on what to do about cleaning, disposal of waste, laundry and other useful information.</p>

<h3>Let fresh air in (ventilation)</h3>

<p>In addition to social distancing and other measures, you can also reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid coming into contact with people in spaces with limited flow of fresh air such as rooms with windows that are never opened</li>
  <li>make sure you let plenty of fresh air into your home without getting uncomfortably cold. If you have people working in or visiting your house for permitted reasons, you should do this during their visit and after they leave</li>
</ul>

<p>To increase the flow of air you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open windows as much as possible</li>
  <li>open doors</li>
  <li>make sure that any vents (for example at the top of a window) are open and airflow is not blocked</li>
  <li>leave extractor fans (for example in bathrooms) running for longer than usual with the door closed after someone has used the room</li>
</ul>

<p>If your home has a mechanical ventilation system which circulates fresh air through vents and ducts, ensure it is working and increase its flow rate when you have visitors (for example, if someone is viewing your house to buy) or if someone in your home is sick. Ensure that ventilation from the room of the person who is ill or isolating only ventilates to the outside (eg. through a window), not to other parts of the property.</p>

<h3>Cleaning</h3>

<p>Regular cleaning plays a vital role in limiting the transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Reducing clutter and removing difficult to clean items can make cleaning easier. Increase the frequency of cleaning, using standard cleaning products such as detergents and bleach, paying attention to all surfaces but especially ones that are touched frequently, such as door handles, light switches, remote controls and electronic devices.</p>

<p>Cleaning should be more frequent depending on the number of people using the space, and whether they are entering and exiting the setting. Cleaning of frequently touched surfaces is particularly important in bathrooms and communal kitchens.</p>

<h3>Kitchen</h3>

<p>It is very unlikely that COVID-19 is transmitted through food. However, as a matter of good hygiene practice, anyone handling food should wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before doing so.</p>

<p>Use a dishwasher to clean and dry your crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them by hand using washing up liquid and warm water and dry thoroughly using a separate tea towel. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly and common kitchen appliances including fridge handles and kettles.</p>

<h3>Bathrooms</h3>

<p>If available, operate a bathroom fan when the bathroom is in use and clean frequently touched surfaces regularly, as well as opening window/s (if available). Toilet lids should be closed before flushing to reduce aerosol droplets. Where cloth towels are used, these should be for individual use and laundered in accordance with washing instructions.</p>

<p>Increased attention should be paid to any potential defects in sanitary plumbing systems in residential blocks, such as unexplained odours.</p>

<h2>How to minimise the spread of infection if your building/block has shared spaces and facilities such as social areas</h2>

<p>Landlords and/or managing agents should help by, for example, closingâ¯non-essential indoor communal space where it would not be possible to maintain social distancing (e.g. small shared spaces for use by more than one household). See also section 2.13 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants">guidance for landlords and tenants</a> on specialist sheltered/retirement and housing with care (âextra-careâ) schemes.</p>

<p>Those who develop symptoms of coronavirus, should not use these facilities, regardless of whether they remain open. For people who are clinically extremely vulnerable, please refer to the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance for individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a>.</p>

<p>Essential communal space includes shared kitchens, bathrooms, toilets,  sitting rooms and laundry rooms. If tenants share essential communal space, they should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>

<p>Shared outdoor spaces such as communal gardens may remain open for use by tenants, but the latest government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing">guidance on social contact</a> must be followed.</p>

<p>Grounds maintenance and estate services can continue. When undertaking such work, landlords should have regard to relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on social distancing in the workplace</a>.</p>

<h2>How to prevent the spread of infection if you are clinically extremely vulnerable and live in rented accommodation with other people</h2>

<p>In the first instance, you should check the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance for individuals who are clinically extremely vulnerable</a> to see how you are affected and what support is available.</p>

<p>In addition to the suggestions in this document, you should also follow the general advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19/how-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-covid-19">how to stop the spread of coronavirus</a> at all times. For example, you may wish to take precautions such as limiting the amount of time you spend in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. Shared spaces should continue to be kept well ventilated.</p>

<p>You may also wish to use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household, if possible. If residents share a bathroom or kitchen with a vulnerable person, it is important that this is cleaned every time it is used, for example by wiping surfaces. Alternatively, residents may wish to consider using a rota, with the vulnerable person using the facilities first.</p>

<p>Please refer to the updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable individuals</a></p>

<h2>How to minimise the spread of infection if you live in overcrowded accommodation</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this guidance, accommodation is overcrowded if its size and the amount of people living in it could risk harming the health of the residents.</p>

<p>It may be harder for residents of overcrowded properties to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves from coronavirus in the same way as residents of other properties.</p>

<p>You should pay particular attention to the above guidance on how to minimise the spread of infection, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>washing hands more frequently, for 20 seconds, with soap and water or use hand sanitiser and avoid touching your face</li>
  <li>regularly clean frequently touched surfaces</li>
  <li>make sure you let plenty of fresh air into your home</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a property is rented, local authorities have powers to require landlords to fix serious overcrowding hazards. We encourage residents and landlords (where there is one) to work together wherever feasible to support everyone to follow social distancing. If you think your property has a serious overcrowding hazard that affects your ability to follow coronavirus guidance you should contact your local authority.</p>

<p>If you live in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/guidance-for-households-with-grandparents-parents-and-children-living-together-where-someone-is-at-increased-risk-or-has-symptoms-of-coronavirus-cov" class="govuk-link">household with different generations for example grandparents, parents, and children living together, then please refer to this guidance</a> to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>

You may want to discuss your needs with your local authority if you follow this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-shielding-support" class="govuk-link">guidance</a> to help you access support.</p>
