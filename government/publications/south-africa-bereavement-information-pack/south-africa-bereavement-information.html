<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The information contained in this guide is general and factual. You should contact&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-africa-list-of-lawyers">local lawyers</a> for independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the [<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO), which applies to all countries.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Contact us: Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, and you may have some unanswered questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, this is where you can find the contact details of the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed of the death. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>
</div>

<p>When someone dies in South Africa, the next of kin is normally the closest living family member, relative or friend of the person who died. An ex-partner is not usually regarded as next of kin.</p>

<p>Examples of next of kin include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a spouse/ partner/ same-sex partner/ civil partner</li>
  <li>adult child (i.e. over 18 years old)</li>
  <li>parent</li>
  <li>adult sibling (i.e. over 18 years old)</li>
  <li>an adult with sufficient relationship to the person who died</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on available contact information, South African authorities may inform family members of the death based on contact details available to them. If there is no information available, authorities may inform the British High Commission. In this instance, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will do whatever they can to trace the next of kin as soon as possible and would seek support from UK police to pass on the sad news.</p>

<p>Local authorities may request family members to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justice.gov.za/master/m_forms/J192.pdf" rel="external">complete an affidavit</a>, confirming that they are the next of kin. This form and a copy of ID is normally required to identify the person who died.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Release of information to next of kin</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this information may only be available to the next of kin.</p>

<p>Consular officers may be able to obtain information on your behalf, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. Staff may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>Information such as how the person died can be shared by the facility where the post mortem took place. If necessary, the manager in charge will refer you to the doctor who performed the post mortem.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. The insurance company will have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, and may be able to cover some of the costs. You will need the insurance policy number and the associated 24-hour medical emergency contact number to do this.</p>

<p>If the travel insurance company confirms that there is a current policy, you should not appoint your own funeral director or be pressurised by local funeral agencies to do so. It will be the insurance company that will appoint the funeral director both locally and in the UK.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring your loved one to the UK for a funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. You should contact your travel insurance company about doing this. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="https:/www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.)</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in South Africa, you can refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https:/www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-funeral-directors-south-africa">list of funeral directors in South Africa</a>.</p>

<p>After the post mortem, and when the body of the person who died is ready for release, the next of kin has 48 hours to arrange an undertaker of their choice to collect the body from the hospital morgue. Thereafter, you may be charged a daily storage fee until an undertaker removes the body, which can normally be paid on your behalf by the undertaker</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>If somebody dies and the cause of death is unknown or unnatural, the identity of the person needs to be confirmed for the medico-legal process. Identifying someone requires a friend or relative to attend a visual identification. If there are no friends or family in South Africa able to do the identification, it is possible to ask a lawyer or third party to do the identification.</p>

<p>If the person who died cannot be visually identified, South Africa has the facilities to conduct DNA, fingerprint and dental analysis.</p>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. You do not need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate.</p>

<p>An application for a death certificate can be lodged at any Department of Home Affairs office. An abridged death certificate will be issued free of charge on the same day as registration. If you require a replacement copy or if you require a full death certificate, you can apply for these at your nearest Home Affairs Office and complete the BI-132 form. You will need ID documents about you and the person who has died, which includes information such as full name, date of birth and ID or passport number.</p>

<p>Should you need further guidance, you should speak to your funeral director to help you register the death.</p>

<p>You can&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/death-abroad">report the death to most UK government organisations</a> in one go using the Tell Us Once service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>When a person dies due to unnatural causes, South African law requires that a post mortem examination be performed on the person who died.</p>

<p>Unnatural deaths can include circumstances such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the death is sudden and unexpected or unexplained</li>
  <li>where application of force, direct or indirect is used</li>
  <li>death due to the effects of chemicals, toxic substances, drugs or an electrical effect</li>
  <li>death where another person, by negligent act or omission, can be held responsible for the death</li>
  <li>any death occurring while the deceased was under local or general anaesthetic</li>
</ul>

<p>Post mortems conducted by local authorities are free of charge. They usually take place soon after the body reaches the mortuary. No final funeral arrangements should be made until the post mortem examination has been performed and the DHA 1663 (death notification form) has been issued.</p>

<p>Appointed forensic pathologists carry out post mortems. If the circumstances around the death are deemed natural, the body is normally released within a few days.</p>

<p>Authorisation from the next of kin is not needed to perform a post mortem and it is not usually possible to request to delay or object to this process. If for religious reasons, you have a preference over how your loved one is prepared, you should speak with the relevant mortuary or undertaker directly about accommodating your requirements.</p>

<p>During a post mortem, the doctor responsible will record all injuries and the condition of the body. Photos may be taken during post mortems if deemed necessary for future court proceedings. Organs and tissue may be removed and retained for analysis and testing at the discretion of the doctor. Next of kin may not be informed about this. In very rare instances, organs or body parts can be kept as evidence and used as evidence in court.</p>

<p>As cases can take years to come to court in South Africa, this might mean parts of the person who died are not released for cremation or burial for some time. Forensic analysis such as toxicology testing can take a long time before results are available.</p>

<p>Upon completion, post mortem reports are shared with the assigned police officer investigating the unnatural death. Obtaining post mortems and police reports may be restricted if there is an ongoing investigation, but are normally available after the cause of death has been confirmed and there are no pending investigations.</p>

<p>State facilities will release the body after the physical identification and post mortem investigation has been completed, and once the attending doctor has issued a death notification form (DHA 1663).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>In circumstances where the death in unnatural, the body will be held at the local hospital or state mortuary.</p>

<p>Standards of facilities vary across South Africa. In most mortuaries, there are temperature controlled storage facilities to preserve the condition of the body. In rural areas, the designated facilities may not be equipped to the same standard. The conditions and facilities of mortuaries in South Africa are different to what you find in the UK and this can be unsettling.</p>

<p>The next of kin or relevant friend or family member will be required to identify the person who died at the state facility.</p>

<p>Identifying loved ones can be an upsetting experience. You may benefit from informal emotional support from friends and family, or you may want to access formal emotional support services. Speak to our consular staff who may be able to put you in touch with emotional support organisations both in South Africa and in the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Burial, cremation, aquamation and repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<p>A private burial can be arranged through a local undertaker.</p>

<p>Cremation facilities are widely available in South Africa. We have been told it takes 24 hours to arrange, although that cannot be guaranteed. You should be aware that remaining ashes may contain some traces of bones, which could be upsetting. If you wish to return to the UK with the ashes of your loved one, you should ask your local undertaker to arrange the required paperwork.</p>

<p>You should carry with you the death certificate and a certificate of cremation. Sometimes a funeral director will request a letter confirming the UK requirements for importing ashes – we can provide this on request. In addition, it is advised that you or your funeral director contact your airline about carrying ashes to check if there are any additional procedures to follow.</p>

<p>Aquamation is a greener alternative to cremation that uses water and chemicals. It is available in some parts of South Africa. You should speak to your insurer or funeral director if you are considering this option.</p>

<p>Repatriation is normally covered by travel insurance. Insurance companies will have a standing agreement with an international funeral director. The local undertaker in South Africa, along with the international undertaker, will arrange a locally registered death certificate, a certificate of embalming, a certificate of non-infectious diseases, and a certificate giving permission to transfer the body to the UK.</p>

<p>All of these certificates are required to repatriate a body. Local certificates are issued in English. Depending on flight availability, the local authorities dealing with the repatriation, the process can usually be carried out within 1 week.</p>

<p>If the person who died is not identified and there are no family or friends to contact, the local mortuary may conduct a pauper’s burial on behalf of the state after 30 days, with the approval of the South African Police Service.</p>

<p>With your consent, organs and tissue can be donated to help others in need or for medical research. If you want to consider donating organs and tissue, you should inform the forensic pathology laboratory within 12-48 hours. No tissue or organs will be donated or retained for medical study without your consent.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on <a class="govuk-link" href="#coroner-inquest">UK coroners and inquests</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>Valuable personal possessions that are not retained as evidence can be collected during identification by the next of kin. Clothing can only be collected once the autopsy process has been completed. You should ensure that you receive all personal possessions not required for further investigation upon identifying the person who died</p>

<p>Further information regarding which personal possessions have been kept for evidentiary purposes will be provided to you at the mortuary.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, the British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate cannot take responsibility for the personal belongings of the person who died. Your funeral director can normally assist in returning personal belongings to the UK if you wish to do so.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information on the steps to take in the UK online. This includes information on arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the person who died. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">step-by-step guide</a> online.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send the passport</a> is available online.</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Child deaths</h2>

<p>When a child dies in South Africa, a child death review is normally conducted. This in-depth process involves the South African Police Service, forensic pathology services, social services, paediatricians and prosecution authorities. Stillbirths are not investigated by the police in South Africa.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Deaths in road traffic accidents</h2>

<p>Sudden deaths as a result of road traffic accidents, are treated in the same way as unnatural deaths. South African law requires that a post mortem examination be performed when someone dies from unnatural causes – refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-autopsies">section 10 on autopsies</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter (culpable homicide)</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as murder or manslaughter, a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide tailored support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation in the UK. You can find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">how the FCDO can help</a> online.</p>

<p>If police are not satisfied with the facts surrounding a death and deem the death suspicious, an autopsy will be required. Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-autopsies">the section on autopsies</a>. Any unnatural death, including murder or manslaughter, will have an assigned investigating officer and case reference number attached to it.</p>

<p>The South African Police Service can inform families of developments. Local authorities normally communicate over the phone, but are not normally able to make international calls. Although, in some circumstances, authorities can use email and internet-based chat apps such as WhatsApp. Most investigating officers will keep families informed if they have information to share.</p>

<p>If the death was caused by a criminal act, the police will conduct an investigation. The state prosecutor will then decide whether to prosecute, based on information available. This could delay the release of the body.</p>

<p>Investigating officers are responsible for conducting an investigation and gathering facts and evidence and normally share available information to families or consular officials, although some information may be limited in an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>If you have concerns following the unnatural death of a family member or friend, you should inform the police immediately. It will be the decision of the State Prosecutor to decide if a criminal act has taken place, and whether a person(s) should be held responsible for the death.</p>

<p>If police deem that they have enough evidence to suggest someone is responsible for the death of another person, the accused is normally arrested. In instances where the accused cannot be located, a warrant of arrest is circulated so that the suspect can be apprehended.</p>

<p>If a murder case becomes inactive, any available DNA evidence will remain on police files in case DNA can be matched at a later date.</p>

<p>Murder and manslaughter cases take longer to resolve in South Africa than they do in the UK. Court hearings generally take place over numerous sittings, often extending over many months and sometimes years. Sometimes, the conclusion of the justice system can be unsatisfactory – particularly where a murder has been confirmed, but the suspect cannot be found.</p>

<p>This can be very distressing for families and friends. If you plan to attend court hearings after losing a loved one, you should be prepared that the case may require multiple sittings before a verdict is reached. The High Commission will provide support to you throughout the case, in the form of following up with investigators and prosecutors until the justice system reaches its conclusion.</p>

<p>You should consider retaining the services of a lawyer to provide legal advice or obtain regular updates.</p>

<p>If you or your family require urgent emotional or medical support as a result of losing a family or friend, you should speak to a doctor in the first instance and consider some of the support organisations listed at the end of this guidance.</p>

<p>You should note that if the person who died is repatriated to parts of the UK, a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#coroner-inquest">UK Coroners and inquests</a> below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated abroad, and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>
</div>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>Legal Aid</h2>

<p>Legal Aid in South Africa provides legal assistance to those without financial means to appoint their own legal representation. They provide free legal advice as well as court representation at the State’s expense. To qualify as eligible for assistance, you will need to complete a strict means test.</p>

<p>In criminal cases involving children, they automatically qualify for legal aid and do not need to take the means test.</p>

<p>For further information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://legal-aid.co.za/" rel="external">Legal Aid South Africa’s website</a>. Alternatively, if you need private legal representation, see our&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-africa-list-of-lawyers">list of lawyers</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>Compensation</h2>

<p>Government led compensation schemes for victims of crime are not available in South Africa. You can find information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack">UK compensation for victims of terrorism overseas</a> online.</p>

<p>You may be eligible to apply for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.za/services/compensation-fund/claim-occupational-injuries-or-disease" rel="external">employment and labour compensation fund</a>, if your loved one died whilst working. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.dsclaw.co.za/road-accident-fund/" rel="external">road accident fund</a> is a government supported insurance fund that provides compensation (if applicable) to the victims of road accidents in South Africa.</p>
