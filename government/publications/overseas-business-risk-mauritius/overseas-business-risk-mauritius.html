<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Political</h2>

<p>Mauritius is a stable democracy and has maintained the top position on the Mo Ibrahim Index for Overall Governance in Africa for 10 consecutive years. The island became independent in 1968 and elections are organised every 5 years. Transition of power has been smooth and peaceful.</p>

<p>Mauritius is a unicameral parliamentary democracy modelled on the Westminster System. Executive powers lie with the Prime Minister and the President is the Head of State. The Judiciary operates independently from the legislative and executive branches.</p>

<p>Hon. Pravind Jugnauth became Prime Minister in January 2017 following the resignation of the late Sir Anerood Jugnauth who became a Minister Mentor, Minister of Defence and Minister for Rodrigues. Pravind Jugnauth is the leader of the Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien, the largest party in the ruling Alliance Lepep coalition which was re-elected following the general election of December 2014. The next general election will be held in December 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Economic</h2>

<p>As a small, open economy, Mauritius is affected by global economic trends, especially conditions in Europe and China. Over the years, the government has tried to diversify the economy, based on exports of sugar, textiles, processed fish, tourism and financial services, into newer sectors like biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and digital services to increase resilience. Europe still accounts for around half of Mauritiusâ exports and tourism, and is a major source of investment. Trade with Africa has become an important part of the international economic strategy, but currently South Africa is the only African trading partner comparable to other traditional EU trading partners.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the economy. In 2020, GDP contracted by 14.9%, the worst performance in 40 years. GDP per capita fell to US$ 8,618 leading to a reclassification to Middle-Income Country status in July 2021 after having been classified for the first time as a High-Income Country in 2020. Tourism and export oriented industries, two key sectors generating foreign exchange earnings, were severely hit. The Rupee depreciated against the Pound Sterling and other major foreign currencies (USD depreciated by 19% from June 2020 to June 2021).</p>

<p>Economic outlook for 2022 is brighter. Over 75% of the population has been fully vaccinated. The borders reopened in October 2021. Mauritius has been removed from the FATF and subsequently UK and EU lists of high risk jurisdictions. GDP is expected to rise to 6.9% (from the estimated 4.8% in 2021) with tourism picking up, investment in public infrastructure and resumption of export activities. However, high public sector debt (89% in December 2021), a widening trade deficit, an increase in inflation (7.4% in January 2022 from 2.5% a year earlier), and unemployment (9.5% at the end of 2021) are major areas of concern.</p>

<p>Mauritius pursues a liberal and open economic policy. The country relies heavily on trade and investment with Europe and the US and more recently with markets like India, China and South Africa.</p>

<p>Mauritius welcomes foreign investment in nearly all sectors of the economy and its nationals are free to invest elsewhere. In 2020, foreign direct investment (FDI) decreased by 36% to MUR 14.2 billion (Â£284 m) as compared to 2019. Real estate activities and financial and insurance services attracted the most FDI. The top FDI sources were France, South Africa, Switzerland, USA and UK.</p>

<p>Mauritius wishes to position itself as a regional hub for investment into Africa. So far, Mauritius has concluded 45 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) and 29 Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPA). As at December 2021, there were 12,463 live Global Business Companies (GBCs) operating in Mauritius. Total Assets for GBCs was USD 643 billion (estimate 2020).</p>

<p>Mauritius is also establishing itself as a Knowledge Hub for Africa, attracting many international universities. There are around 35 UK universities and awarding bodies offering UK qualifications recognised in Mauritius and the UK. Following the success of this project on the local market, international marketing is being carried out to attract foreign students, especially from African countries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Business environment</h2>

<p>Mauritius is considered to be one of the most business-friendly countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as a result of its political stability, good governance and independent judiciary. It ranked first in Africa and 54th most competitive nation in the world out of 140 countries, ranked in the 2019 edition of the Global Competitiveness Report published by the World Economic Forum.</p>

<p>Mauritius signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the United Kingdom (UK) on 31 January 2019. This entered into force on 1 January 2021</p>

<p>On 7 January 2022, the European Union Commission officially announced removal of Mauritius from its list of high-risk third countries which identifies third-country jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter Terrorist Financing regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the European Union.</p>

<p>The removal of Mauritius from the EUâs list will enhance Mauritiusâ status as a leading jurisdiction in the global financial services industry and reinforce its position as a notable investment destination and domicile of choice for structuring cross-border investment into Africa and Asia. Compared to other African countries, the risks of doing business in Mauritius are low. However, challenges have been reported in finding suitably qualified personnel e.g. in the IT, telecommunications, medical and other specialised sectors.</p>

<p>Mauritius has a wealth of well-qualified financial and legal personnel, most of them trained in the UK, and benefits from a bi-lingual French/ English workforce. Local labour law can be complex and companies are recommended to hire highly qualified human resource personnel.</p>

<p>The most important sectors of the Mauritian economy are textiles, tourism, financial and business services, information and communication technology, seafood processing, real estate development, energy, and education/training. The government of Mauritius sees innovation as the basis for long-term growth. Before COVID-19, authorities planned to stimulate economic growth in 5 areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>serving as a gateway for investment into Africa</li>
  <li>increasing the use of renewable energy</li>
  <li>developing smart cities</li>
  <li>growing the blue economy</li>
  <li>modernising infrastructure, especially public transport, the port and the airport</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the pandemic, however, the governmentâs focus in 2022 will be to continue to rebuild existing sectors.</p>

<p>The Mauritius International Arbitration Centre (MIAC) that operated as a joint venture with the London Court of International Arbitration until 2018, brings a high level of dispute resolution services to the international community. MIAC has operated as an independent arbitration centre since 27 July 2018, drawing on the significant expertise gained during this initial phase of its development. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London is the final court of appeal for Mauritius.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for UK nationals and bodies incorporated under UK Law, to bribe anywhere in the world. In addition, a commercial organisation conducting business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK whether or not  the offence takes place in the UK.</p>

<p>In 2021, Mauritius was ranked 49th out of 180 countries in Transparency Internationalâs corruption perception index. The country is often cited as Sub-Saharan Africaâs example of good governance and democracy. The 2021 Democracy Index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries, considers Mauritius as the only full democracy on the African continent ranking it 1st in Sub-Saharan Africa and 19th worldwide.</p>

<p>Mauritian governments have implemented anti-corruption measures, including the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in 2002.</p>

<p>Weaknesses remain at the legislative level, particularly concerning regulations dealing with both private sector corruption and the funding of political parties.</p>

<p>There are ongoing investigations into alleged fraud and corruption in both the public and private sector. Senior political leaders are also subject to legal proceedings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Human rights</h2>

<p>Mauritius Human Development Index (2019 report) was 0.8, which put the country in the high human development category, positioning it at 66 out of 188 countries and territories.</p>

<p>Chapter II of The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.govmu.org/English/Legislations/Pages/Constitution.aspx" rel="external">Constitution of Mauritius</a> guarantees the protection of fundamental rights and freedom of the individual. A National Human Rights Commission was created under The Protection of Human Rights Act to deal with complaints of breaches of human rights listed in the Constitution and complaints against the Police.</p>

<p>Commonly reported human rights problems in Mauritius include the mistreatment of suspects and detainees by the Police, domestic violence against women and discrimination against minority groups including LGBT+ people.</p>

<p>The UK has been working with the Mauritius Government, UK retailers, local manufacturers and NGOs on projects to improve migrant workersâ rights in Mauritius. In 2019, the UK funded the publication of a guide to inform migrant workers of their rights and possible remedial actions in case of violations. The booklet called âKnow Your Rightsâ has been published in six languages.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eoc.govmu.org/English/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">Equal Opportunity Commission</a> became operational under the Equal Opportunities Act of 2008. It investigates allegations of discrimination and promotes equality of opportunity in both the private and public sectors. Mauritian law requires organisations employing more than 35 people to set aside at least 3% of their positions for persons with disabilities. Workers exercise their rights of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.</p>

<p>The law prohibits the employment of children under 16 years of age and prohibits the employment of children between 16 and 18 years old in work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or otherwise unsuitable for young persons. The Government introduced a minimum wage in January 2018.</p>

<p>Female participation in the Mauritius labour force is about 45%, with a growing prevalence of dual income households. Women can generally enjoy an active social life and mixed race marriages are not uncommon.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>Infringement of copyright and intellectual property is not uncommon in Mauritius. It is recommended that trademarks and/or IPs be registered to avoid fraudulent use.

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Crime</h2>

<p>The Mauritius Police Force is allowed to arrest and detain an individual on a provisional charge until investigations are completed, which can be a lengthy process. The UK government has previously raised its concerns about the use of the provisional charge and the issue was also raised at the UN International Human Rights Council in 2014.</p>
