<p>The abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard was a horrendous crime and has had a devastating impact on her family and loved ones. That it was committed by a serving Metropolitan Police officer, Wayne Couzens, abusing his position to do so, is abhorrent and risks undermining the public’s confidence in policing.</p>

<p>It is of vital importance that there is a clear understanding of how this was able to happen and the lessons identified so that policing, and partners, can do everything possible to ensure it cannot happen again. This inquiry has been established to achieve this.</p>

<p>The forces where the perpetrator worked or volunteered are fully committed to supporting the work of the inquiry.</p>

<p>This inquiry has been established as a non-statutory inquiry but if necessary, the Home Secretary may agree to convert into a statutory inquiry, following advice from the Chair.</p>

<h2>Phase 1</h2>

<p>Phase 1 of the inquiry will seek to establish:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An overall timeline of Couzens’ career and relevant incidents, including allegations of criminal behaviour and/or misconduct;</li>
  <li>The circumstances and decision-making relating to his vetting and re-vetting, including whether any potential risks and/or red flags were missed;</li>
  <li>Any other relevant matters arising from his transfers between forces;</li>
  <li>His overall conduct – including non-disciplinary matters, his performance and training;</li>
  <li>The extent to which any issues relating to his behaviour, particularly in relation to women, were known and raised by colleagues, (including professional standards and senior leaders);</li>
  <li>Any abuse of his police powers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The inquiry will seek to establish these through methods including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of documentation from relevant forces, including the Metropolitan Police Service, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Kent Police;</li>
  <li>Interviews and witness statements;</li>
  <li>Findings from the relevant Independent Office for Police Conduct investigations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The inquiry will keep the Everard family informed on its progress.</p>

<p>The inquiry shall make recommendations for any immediate steps that policing, and other partners, need to take to address issues arising from this work.</p>

<p>It shall report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department as soon as practicable, taking into account any ongoing investigations and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>The aim is that this should happen within 6 – 9 months from the agreed start of the Inquiry. 
The Secretary of State for the Home Department will publish the report and will have regard to her obligations under the Human Rights Act and her duties in respect of national security before the report is published.</p>

<p>The findings of Phase 1 will inform the Secretary of State for the Home Department’s consideration of what further, broader, issues arise for policing and the protection of women should be considered in Phase 2 of the Inquiry.</p>
