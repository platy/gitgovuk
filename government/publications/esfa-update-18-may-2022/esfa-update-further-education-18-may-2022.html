<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: apply for a grant to train a senior mental health lead</h2>

<p>This financial year, a further two-thirds of all eligible institutions in England will have the opportunity to benefit from quality assured senior mental health lead training, backed by an additional £7 million in training grants.</p>

<p>We have published guidance on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding">access and apply for your grant.<br>
</a></p>

<p>For more information about the grant, read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/senior-mental-health-lead-training">senior mental health training lead guidance.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: review of post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below in England</h2>

<p>We have published a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualifications-that-overlap-with-t-levels">provisional list</a> of qualifications that will have funding approval removed for 16 to 19-year-olds from 1 August 2024 and the process for awarding organisations (AOs) to appeal the decision to remove funding.</p>

<p>In the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/post-16-qualifications-review-team/review-of-post-16-qualifications-at-level-3/" rel="external">second stage consultation of the review of post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below</a>, the Department for Education set out its intent to remove funding approval for 16 to 19-year-olds from qualifications that overlap with T Levels. This is because we believe the rigour of T Levels means they provide the best overall preparation for students to enter skilled employment, and therefore are the right choice for most 16 to 19-year-olds who wish to pursue a technical route.</p>

<p>We have also published <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualifications-that-overlap-with-t-levels">appeals guidance</a>, which sets out how awarding organisations can to submit an appeal to us for why funding approval should be retained for individual qualifications. Appeals will only be accepted from awarding organisations and must be submitted by 5pm on Friday 8 July 2022.</p>

<p>Awarding organisations can access further support by joining a webinar on the appeals process on Thursday 26 May at 2pm to 4pm.&nbsp;You can <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Overlap.APPEALS@education.gov.uk">submit any queries and log your interest for the webinar</a>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Reminder: updating course directory with apprenticeship training offer</h2>

<p>Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1051720/ESFA_Apprenticeship_Agreement_for_Training_Providers__January_2022_.pdf" rel="external">Apprenticeship Agreement</a>, main apprenticeship training providers are required to provide up to date information, through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the Course Directory</a>, about the apprenticeships they offer which are funded by ESFA.</p>

<p>Course Directory data and information is shared with employers when they use the ESFA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find Apprenticeship Training</a> online search facility, to find apprenticeship standards and identify approved providers that can deliver training.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employers-find-apprenticeship-training">Find Apprenticeship Training</a> provides information to employers about a training provider’s organisation and their apprenticeship offer, including the geographical areas they cover, helping to inform employer choice. It is important that this information is up to date so that employers and ESFA have an accurate view of coverage of apprenticeship provision across all apprenticeships.</p>

<p>To ensure compliance with your Apprenticeship Agreement, we are asking all providers to ensure their information is up to date and complete. You can add new apprenticeships, edit and update existing apprenticeships and remove those you no longer offer through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-apprenticeship-training-how-to-submit-data">Publish to the Course Directory</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: latest update on EQA reform progress</h2>

<p>Considerable progress has been made with transition of quality assurance reforms for apprenticeship assessment  with the external quality assurance (EQA) of over 270 apprenticeships covering around 95% of apprentices transitioning to Ofqual.</p>

<p>By the end of May, a total of 272 apprenticeships previously overseen by the old Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) EQA service will have transitioned to Ofqual, covering more than 95% of apprentices.</p>

<p>This will mean that Ofqual will in total be providing EQA for at least 470 apprenticeships – considering those that it already regulates.</p>

<p>IfATE will provide a temporary, free-of-charge, in-house advice, and quality assurance solution for around 40 apprenticeships that will not transition by the end the May. This will ensure that End-point assessment (EPA) can continue, and that quality will be maintained. For all enquiries, advice or to request further information related to the temporary service please <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:EQAQueries.IFA@education.gov.uk">contact IfATE</a>.</p>

<p>Phase two of the transition process covers end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) whose EQA provider service was previously delivered by a professional body. Their first applications should be submitted by 16 May 2022, and it is planned that the transfer process will be concluded by 31 December 2022, in accordance with the programme published in October 2021.</p>

<p>EPAOs already recognised by Ofqual, who want to expand their scope to include other standards, should continue to submit these as soon as possible and there is no limit to the number of times an EPAO may apply for recognition.</p>
