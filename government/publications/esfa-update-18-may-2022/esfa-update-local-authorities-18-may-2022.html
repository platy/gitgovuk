<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: Adult education budget (AEB) funding rules 2021 to 2022 update: National Skills Fund level 3 offer for 19 to 23-year-old learners</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022">performance management section</a> of the funding rules clarifies the use of the LDM code 378, to record 19 to 23-year-old learners’ delivery for all National Skills Fund level 3 offer when you submit ILR data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: reminder to consider the Parent Pledge when reviewing budgets for the current financial year</h2>

<p>We understand that many local authorities will be currently reviewing budget submissions from their schools for the current financial year. We would encourage reviewers to consider how schools are budgeting considering the Parent Pledge, published as part of last month’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opportunity-for-all-strong-schools-with-great-teachers-for-your-child">Schools White Paper</a>. The Parent Pledge sets out a commitment that any child who falls behind in English or maths will get support to help them catch up, and that schools will keep parents updated on their child’s progress. We know that most schools and trusts are already doing this, but for some it will be a shift in approach.</p>

<p>School leaders are best placed to understand the needs of their pupil cohorts and have the flexibility to prioritise their spending to support those needs. We have encouraged schools to review funding and support available to them, including funding through the pupil premium and the National Tutoring Programme.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Education has separately contacted all schools requesting that those who have not yet started to offer tutoring do so as soon as possible. He is also keen to ensure all schools are planning for tutoring next year and from September all tutoring funding will be allocated directly to schools. We will shortly be sharing further information with schools on the NTP funding they will receive for 2022 to 2023 academic year, to support them to develop a tutoring offer for their pupils for next year.</p>
