<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>   Background</h2>

<p>The Launch UK Technology Investment Programme is the UK Space Agency’s (UK Space Agency) new fund established to support the development of technology within the UK’s launch supply chain.</p>

<p>The programme will provide grant funding to UK project teams to support the development of their technology, products, services and capabilities.</p>

<p>The UK Space Agency is now inviting applications from organisations, including industry and academia, that are interested in developing their technology, products, services or capabilities, related to launch.</p>

<p>We are looking to match-fund projects that are complete in this financial year, therefore for this call please restrict projects to those that will achieve significant milestones by the end of the 22/23 Financial Year (FY). We aim to release a longer/multiyear call the following FY.</p>

<p>Lead organisations will only be eligible to be awarded one grant directly.</p>

<p>The programme will be run in conjunction with existing UK Space Agency and ESA research and development (R&amp;D) funds including the National Space Innovation Programme (NSIP) and ESA’s Commercial Space Transports Systems (CSTS).</p>

<p>The call aims to develop the capability of the UK spaceflight sector and research base by providing funding to support the whole supply chain, across all Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), helping to develop the whole of the UK’s spaceflight pipeline and position the UK to be competitive in this sector.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> North Star Metric</h3>

<p>This section explains UK Space Agency’s North Star Metric in Measuring Investment Impacts.</p>

<p>The Agency works to ensure that our investment in space brings about real benefit to the UK and its people. Our principal metric by which the UK Space Agency measures its success is the level of total investment and contract revenue we help to bring into the UK space sector.</p>

<p>Consistent monitoring and evaluation of our programmes is important so that we understand how well we are delivering the UK Space Agency’s objectives. This in turn helps us to ensure we are delivering the National Space Strategy, and informs how we prioritise our resources, select the projects we invest in, and make the case for future public spending on space.</p>

<p>UK Space Agency grant recipients are required to report on how the grant funding has led to investment and contract revenue as a condition of funding. Please refer to Annex 12 in the Grant Funding Agreement’s (Annex G1,2,3) and The North Star Metric Reporting Guidance (Annex C-1).</p>

<p>Data to be collected </p>

<p>Reporting will primarily involve four key elements: </p>

<p>·    Total income </p>

<p>·    Total Internal Investment </p>

<p>·    Total Private Investment </p>

<p>·    Additional detail on funding sources as appropriate </p>

<p>·    Any Additional Benefits you wish to Report </p>

<p>Data should only be reported where it could be reasonably stated that the revenue and/or investment in question would not have occurred without UK Space Agency’s funding. Where the revenue and/or investment may have only been partially realised in the absence of UK Space Agency’s funding, best efforts should be made to estimate the proportion of contract revenue and/or investment which can have been said to have occurred as a result. </p>

<ul>
  <li>To be reported on a quarterly basis from the start of the activity covered by this agreement. </li>
  <li>Data will be required for at least 5 years after the completion of the activity covered by this agreement. </li>
  <li>Where the length of benefit realisation would be longer than 5 years, the UK Space Agency may require an extended reporting period. This is to ensure that we are capturing the full benefits of an activity that has a long time period before those benefits are realised. Where this is the case the UK Space Agency will agree with grant recipients beforehand at the time at which a further request for information is sensible.  </li>
  <li>Any additional benefits that have resulted from UK Space Agency’s funding can also be reported through open text response </li>
</ul>

<p>The information you provide will only be used by the UK Space Agency and not shared with any other parties. Aggregate information may be presented more widely but this will be fully anonymised and not be attributable to any individual organisation. </p>

<p>In addition, this information is being used to assess the agencies impact on the space sector and is not intended to be used as a way to evaluate how the grant is being run. not the individual performance of grants.</p>

<p>Please confirm the name and contact details of the person in your organisation who will be responsible for providing this information. </p>

<p>If you have any specific questions on this requirement, please contact the UK Space Agency programme manager or named UK Space Agency contact. </p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Subsidy Control</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The UK Space Agency (UK Space Agency) supports organisations to invest in research, development and innovation. The support we provide is consistent with the UK’s international obligations and commitments to Subsidy Control (see further information at Annex E).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before awarding subsidies, the UK Space Agency must ensure that the subsidy scheme meets the terms of the principles as determined in the<a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948093/TCA_SUMMARY_PDF.pdf" rel="external"> </a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948093/TCA_SUMMARY_PDF.pdf" rel="external">UK-EU Trade &amp; Cooperation Agreement</a><a class="govuk-link" href="https://beisgov-my.sharepoint.com/personal/thomas_barratt_ukspaceagency_gov_uk/Documents/Documents/Launch%20funding%20call%20Aug%2022/Launch%20UK%20Technology%20Investment%20Programme%20Grant%20Call.docx#_ftn2" rel="external">[2]</a> (TCA):</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The principles are that:</p>

<p>·    subsidies should pursue a specific public policy objective to remedy an identified market failure or to address an equity rationale such as social difficulties or distributional concerns (“the objective”)</p>

<p>·    subsidies should be proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective</p>

<p>·    subsidies should be designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary that is conducive to achieving the objective and that would not be achieved in the absence of subsidies being provided</p>

<p>·    subsidies should not normally compensate for the costs the beneficiary would have funded in the absence of any subsidy</p>

<p>·    subsidies should be an appropriate policy instrument to achieve a public policy objective and that objective cannot be achieved through other less distortive means</p>

<p>·    subsidies’ positive contributions to achieving the objective should outweigh any negative effects, in particular the negative effects on trade or investment between the Parties</p>

<ol>
  <li>To ensure this competition provides funding in line with the UK’s obligations and commitments to Subsidy Control:</li>
</ol>

<p>The intervention rates detailed in Annex E shall apply unless:</p>

<p>a)   the bidder seeks to claim exemption from having to make a contribution under the Small Amounts of Financial Assistance Allowance (previously known as de-minimis under State Aid) rules.</p>

<p>b)   the bidder is a research or public sector organisation or charity:</p>

<p>When referring to research organisations, UK Space Agency uses the definition from the Framework for state aid for research and development and innovation which states: </p>

<p>“‘research and knowledge dissemination organisation’ or ‘research organisation’ means an entity (such as universities or research institutes, technology transfer agencies, innovation intermediaries, research-oriented physical or virtual collaborative entities), irrespective of its legal status (organised under public or private law) or way of financing, whose primary goal is to independently conduct fundamental research, industrial research or experimental development or to widely disseminate the results of such activities by way of teaching, publication or knowledge transfer. Where such entity also pursues economic activities, the financing, the costs and the revenues of those economic activities must be accounted for separately. Undertakings that can exert a decisive influence upon such an entity, for example in the quality of shareholders or members, may not enjoy a preferential access to the results generated by it.” </p>

<p>Within UK Space Agency, this means: </p>

<p>§   universities – higher education institutions </p>

<p>§   non-profit research and technology organisations (RTOs), including catapults </p>

<p>§   public sector organisations (PSOs) </p>

<p>§   public sector research establishments (PSREs) </p>

<p>§   research council institutes </p>

<p>§   research organisations (ROs) </p>

<p>§   charities. </p>

<p>This list is not comprehensive and is subject to change and exceptions.</p>

<p>Research organisations undertaking non-economic activity will be funded as follows: </p>

<p>§   universities: 80% of full economic costs</p>

<p>§   all other research organisations: 100% of eligible costs. </p>

<p>Research organisations should be non-profit distributing to qualify. They should explain how they will disseminate the output of their project research as outlined in the application. </p>

<p>Research organisations which are engaged in economic activity as part of the project will be treated as business enterprises for the purposes of funding</p>

<p>Public sector organisation or charity </p>

<p>Public sector organisations and charities can work with businesses to achieve innovation through knowledge, skills and resources. These organisations must not take part in any economic activity or gain economic benefit from a project. They can apply for 100% of funding for their eligible costs under the following conditions: </p>

<p>·    they are undertaking research (this may be experimental, theoretical or critical investigation work to gain knowledge, skills or understanding vital to the project) </p>

<p>·    they meet requirements for dissemination of their project results and they state in the application how they will do this </p>

<p>·    they include their eligible costs for research purposes in the total research organisation involvement </p>

<p>·    they make sure they are not applying for funding towards costs which are already being paid by the public purse such as labour and overheads. </p>

<p>Third sector </p>

<p>Third sector organisations are primarily voluntary and community, such as associations, self-help groups, mutuals and cooperatives. Third sector organisations can be non-funding partners in a project. </p>

<p>Bidders must identify the work proposed, and this must be consistent with the work programme described in the technical case. Note that the company size defines the maximum ‘Intervention’ rate (and hence the minimum required PV level) that is permitted (see Annex E). Bidders will be expected to justify the category of work selected.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bidders must ensure that they supply the correct information that allows UK Space Agency to award grants within the scheme. It is the responsibility of the grant funder to ensure compliance with the relevant Subsidy Controls rules and the bidder to assist the funder in doing this by acting within the terms and conditions of the scheme. Further guidance about subsidy control is available on the gov.uk website:</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Grant Funding Agreement</h3>

<p>The Grant Funding Agreement (GFA) template is included (Annex G-1, G-2, G-3 and G4). Applicants must sign up to the terms as set out in the grant funding agreement.</p>

<p>No material changes to the terms will be considered. Minor changes may be considered if an applicant can demonstrate that agreeing to the provision within the Grant Funding Agreement would result in the applicant breaching its statutory or regulatory obligations. Grant applicants wishing to propose changes should not make changes directly to templates but engage with the call lead - via the Spaceflight email address - and advice will be provided.</p>

<p>UK Space Agency require that all partners in a Consortia application have signed a Collaboration Agreement (CA) within 30 days of grant commencement date. The CA should as a minimum reference the terms of the Grant Offer Letter and GFA, specify the work division, intellectual property arrangements and a dispute rectification process. UK Space Agency will, in event of a dispute between partners, expect for the dispute to be resolved within the terms of the CA.</p>

<p>A draft Grant Offer Letter (GOL) has also been included (Annex G-4) to demonstrate the terms that successful applicants will be required to sign up to. This should be reviewed by Applicants. Inclusion of the Draft Offer Letter does not constitute any offer of work or payment by UK Space Agency at this stage and is provided for information purposes only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Grant Recipient Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>###</p>

<p>All organisations in receipt of grant funding must abide by the UK government Code of Conduct for Grant Recipients:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/754555/2018-11-06_Code_of_Conduct_for_Grant_Recipients.pdf" rel="external">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/754555/2018-11-06_Code_of_Conduct_for_Grant_Recipients.pdf</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>   Assessment of Applications</h2>

<p>Applications that meet the mandatory criteria above will be assessed by an independent advisory panel. This panel will consist of independent UK Space Agency reviews drawn from academia, industry or government.</p>

<p>Proposals will be assessed against a range of criteria, with criteria weighted to reflect their relative importance to the final score. A detailed copy of the scoring system and weighting can be found in Annex F. The criteria to be assessed will include:</p>

<p>·    Competitiveness/Relevance</p>

<p>·    Technical Feasibility</p>

<p>·    Innovation</p>

<p>·    Benefit to the UK and investment that will be catalysed</p>

<p>·    Management and planning</p>

<p>Assessors will provide scores for each question in the application. All applications are assessed on individual merit. The UK Space agency will make the final decision regarding funding, using the panel’s recommendations and wider relevant legal, policy and financial considerations. The UK Space Agency will also take into account the available budget across the funding period, the value of money of the proposal, and the requested amounts of funding for each project in the subsequent financial years. The UK Space Agency will also be seeking to establish a balanced portfolio of projects across the space sector.</p>

<p>To aid our consideration, Annex F provides guidance for evaluation criteria for proposals and sets out the minimum information that all submissions must include.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Project Milestones/Deliverable Plan</h3>

<p>Bidders must set out payment plans noting that:</p>

<p>·    payments will be made in arrears on acceptance of progress reports, deliverables and final reporting. Payment to be made once costs have been incurred.</p>

<p>·    should actual costs incurred be greater than the value of the milestone value, these costs will be borne by the Grant Recipient, unless the additional expenditure has been agreed with the UK Space Agency ahead of the costs being incurred and a Grant Change Notice (GCN) executed.</p>

<p>·    payment of the grant will be made in the form of staged payments together with a final payment on successful completion of the project. To reduce administrative burden please ensure a proportionate number of milestone linked payments.</p>

<p>·    the first milestone should reflect a significant stage in the project and cannot be made on completion of the kick-off meeting (T+0) as this is not eligible for a milestone payment value.</p>

<p>·    payment plans must be constructed to include and reflect major project stages and intermediate deliverables.</p>

<p>·    The work package structure should be outlined and clearly linked to the relevant milestone/deliverables, e.g. through a GANNT chart or an equivalent project plan. Critical paths and dependencies should be outlined where possible.</p>

<p>The milestone and work package plan will be captured using information in the Budget template (Annex B) and the Application form (Annex A-1) such as GANNT charts and further schedule details.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Evaluation Criteria</h3>

<p>After the deadline for application submission, valid applications will be sent for assessment.</p>

<p>Only applications that meet the following mandatory eligibility criteria and scope of the call will be sent for assessment:</p>

<p>·    Acceptance of the terms and conditions of UK Space Agency’s published grant agreement (Annex G).</p>

<p>The UK Space Agency reserves the right to declare a project proposal as out of scope or incomplete.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Reporting/Meeting Requirements</h3>

<p>Following an award and completion of grant agreement formalities, projects will be expected to start as soon as possible, and no later than 3 weeks after grant signature. The UK Space Agency will assign a Project Coordinator to oversee the projects with the following methodology:</p>

<p>·    The project coordinator will initiate each project normally by teleconference via a kick-off meeting which should be accompanied by a short presentation on the project by the project team.</p>

<p>·    The grant recipient will provide short progress reports to the coordinator, and the schedule for these will be agreed at the project kick-off meeting and are normally at 4 or 6 weeks. A template will be made available at kick off.</p>

<p>·    The grant recipient will schedule a mid-term progress meeting, as well as any with the Project Coordinator. Projects should include other technical review points (e.g. Preliminary /Critical Design</p>

<p>·    Reviews) to enable planning and obtaining of relevant expert input.</p>

<p>·    The grant recipient will provide milestone/deliverables within the proposal using the template provided in Annex H.</p>

<p>·    The grant recipient will provide reporting on the progress of the project to evidence the milestone/deliverable has been met. On acceptance from the Project Coordinator of the evidenced milestone/deliverable and supporting financial evidence, the grant recipient will be invited to provide an invoice detailing the spend against each budgetary category for that milestone/deliverable.</p>

<p>·    At the end of the project an IPR free final report and an executive summary are to be provided to the UK Space Agency. The executive summary must not contain any confidential information, as this may be uploaded onto the UK Space Agency website. All other reports should be marked commercial in confidence where applicable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Monitoring and Evaluation</h3>

<p>Monitoring and evaluation surveys will be periodically released by UK Space Agency and projects will be expected to respond. This may include a requirement to respond following the close of the grant funded period.</p>

<p>As stated in Section 2.3 and Annex C-1, there will be an ongoing requirement as part of the Grant Funding Agreement (Annex 12 in GFA) to report the realisation of North Star metrics and secured investment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Confidentiality</h3>

<p>The procedure for handling and assessing the bids and notifications will be as follows:</p>

<p>·    All proposals and notifications will be held in confidence by UK Space Agency, except to be shared with evaluation panellists.</p>

<p>·    Information relating to the proposals may also be shared with other UK government departments, agencies and arm’s length bodies.</p>

<p>·    Summary information on all successful proposals who receive grant funding will be made public, including the summary of the proposal (from Section 4 of the Application Form), the amount of grant funding awarded and the identities of organisations involved.</p>

<p>·    For those bids not recommended by for funding, documentation will be retained by the UK Space</p>

<p>·    Agency for reference. The proposals will not be visible to any others, and the names of any unsuccessful bidders will not be published.</p>

<p>·    All other documentation relating to bids selected for funding will remain confidential within the UK government.</p>

<p>Information submitted as part of a proposal, or subsequent commercially sensitive information submitted as part of the grant agreement, will not be disclosed by us save for in so far as we consider necessary, in our absolute discretion, to comply with our legal obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, Environmental Information Regulations 2004 or any other legal act, requirement or obligation. Where permitted by law, we will attempt to notify you of any such disclosure.</p>

<p>##</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>   Finance Policies</h2>

<p>###</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Cost Recovery</h3>

<p>The funds from Grant funding are on a cost recovery basis only. Grants are solely intended to cover the cost of delivering the agreed activity or goal. Any surplus funds not spent will be lost to the project unless there are alternative arrangements agreed.</p>

<p>Grantees cannot receive any funding from other grants/contracts to undertake the same activities.</p>

<p>Grant funding cannot be rolled over between financial years without explicit consent from UK Space Agency.</p>

<p>All partners must use a separate, project-specific, bank account or project accounting code for project funds to enable a clear audit trail.</p>

<p>Invoicing</p>

<p>UK Space Agency will only pay on actuals therefore we expect invoices may differ from forecasts. Should actual costs incurred be greater than the value of the milestone value, these costs will be borne by the Grant Recipient, unless the additional expenditure has been agreed with the UK Space Agency ahead of the costs being incurred and a Grant Change Notice (GCN) executed.</p>

<p>Staff Costs</p>

<p>Staff costs must be calculated on a cost recovery basis only and broken down by pay costs and overheads separately.</p>

<p>Pay costs</p>

<p>Pay costs are calculated based on your PAYE records. They should include gross salary, employer National Insurance (NI) contributions and employer pension contributions. Pay costs must not include:</p>

<p>·    Any profit margins</p>

<p>·    Commercial charge-out rates</p>

<p>·    Allowances for bonuses and benefits in kind</p>

<p>·    Business development</p>

<p>·    Travel and Subsistence</p>

<p>These pay rates will be subject to checks during the negotiation stage by internal or external teams to ensure that day rates reflect actual costs. High payroll costs will be challenged and evidence (such as pay slips, etc.) must be provided to justify that the rate is on a cost recovery basis only.</p>

<p>When making grant claims against labour costs, actual costs claimed must be supported with timesheets of those individuals who have worked on the project.</p>

<p>In the budget breakdown, you are asked to provide a pay cost per day. Using actual gross monthly payroll costs, please assume 260 working days in the year, less annual leave and public holiday entitlements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Overheads</h3>

<p>Full overhead recovery or full absorption costing is not eligible.</p>

<p>We understand that organisations calculate overheads in different ways.</p>

<p>This section offers 3 options for overhead costs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>No overheads. You can select this option if you are not incurring or claiming grant for your overheads</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 20% of labour costs option allows you to claim 20% of your labour costs as overhead. This includes both direct and indirect overhead. Selecting this option allows us to review a successful grant application much faster as no further documentation is needed from you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The calculate overheads option asks you to complete calculations for claiming direct and indirect overheads. Any value claimed under this method will need to be reviewed by our project finance team if your application is successful. This is so we can assess the appropriateness of the overhead value you are claiming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an organisation qualifies and applies for Full Economic Cost (FEC) recovery, your application should be supported by the latest signed off Transparent Approach to Costing (TRAC) return or equivalent financials to support the requested amount. Academic partners will be funded in all cases at 80% of FEC.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that once the overhead is calculated and approved it cannot be exceeded at any time throughout the project life.</p>

<p>For option 3 you must complete the overhead calculation spreadsheet and return with your grant submission.</p>

<p>For option 3 you must complete the overhead calculation spreadsheet and return with your grant submission. Full guidance and the spreadsheet are provided in Annexes D-1 and D-2.</p>

<p>Indirect (administration) overhead</p>

<p>Selecting the indirect (administration) overheads link will take you to a template you’ll need to complete to calculate these costs.</p>

<p>We class indirect overheads as those costs associated with back office functions (such as finance, HR, administration staff) whose primary function is to support the running of a business enterprise. Typically these costs are not directly related to a particular product or service production.</p>

<p>Indirect overhead costs are eligible for inclusion if they are incurred directly as a result of undertaking the project. They must be additional, which means over and above your business as usual costs. Requests for higher then 20% overheads that cannot clearly demonstrate the additional resource specifically due to the grant being undertaken will be rejected.</p>

<p>Where you have already identified specific ‘indirect’ individuals working directly on the project, these should have been captured in the labour costs (section) together with their attributable overhead.</p>

<p>We have provided cost categories in the template. The table below provides our definition for each category.</p>

<p>The following is a step-by-step guide to help you fill in the relevant details to make your costs claim for indirect overhead.</p>

<p>Column A</p>

<p>Starting with your latest set of audited accounts please input your details against the relevant cost category in column A. If you are a new company or this information is unavailable, please use internal management accounts or forecast data.</p>

<p>Note that for the administration support staff costs section, the costs included here must be based upon PAYE (gross salary, NI, company pension contribution, life insurance). They should exclude discretionary package costs such as bonuses, awards, PRP and dividends. In addition please exclude any members working directly on the project who are customer facing or those engaged in operational/production areas.</p>

<p>Column B</p>

<p>In this column you should detail the proportion of the costs outlined in column A that represent core administration activity. You should follow the definitions and eligibility criteria outlined in the cost categories table above. You can use a percentage.</p>

<p>Column C</p>

<p>In column C please state what percentage of these costs you would assess as being additional and directly attributable administration activity to the project you are undertaking. By additional we mean over and above business as usual and specific to the Grant.</p>

<p>Column D</p>

<p>Based upon the details you’ve given in the previous columns, column D will automatically calculate the costs you’ve stated as being attributable to this project.</p>

<p>Column E</p>

<p>In column E you will need to provide some description of the cost constituents.</p>

<p>Once you have filled in this data you will see a percentage calculation (column F). This calculates what you consider as being eligible indirect overhead costs for your project (D) as a proportion of the annual audited figures (A). To save you time we use this calculated percentage and apply it to the remainder cost categories you have completed.</p>

<p>Any administration costs that are ineligible in this section but which directly relate to the project (for example based on invoices), should be claimed as direct costs within other sections of the finance form.</p>

<p>Completion of the indirect overheads template will calculate an annual total which will be proportioned for the length of time you are working on the project. You will see a per annum, per month and a per project cost. The per project costs will form your total indirect overheads as a monetary value.</p>

<p>Once you have filled out your indirect overheads information choose the ‘return to the overheads section’ to take you back to the main overheads section. Here you will see a summary of your indirect overhead.</p>

<p>Direct overhead</p>

<p>Selecting the direct overheads link will take you to a template you’ll need to complete to calculate these costs.</p>

<p>We understand that in undertaking a project you may incur associated costs with those staff working directly on the project. We refer to these as direct overheads. Typical costs in this area could include direct staff provision of laptops (non-capital only), desks, office (such as occupancy, facilities and utilities) and IT infrastructure and systems. This section is provided in free format for you to list out such costs.</p>

<p>Direct overhead costs must be directly attributable to the project you are undertaking and should not represent a full recovery methodology inclusive of redundant, spare capacity time or cost.</p>

<p>You should detail the costs and include a description of each item together with the methodology or basis of apportionment used. This should include the calculations that support the claimable costs. This will help us to validate these costs if your project is successful. If your costs have been subject to an independent audit verification we may ask you to provide this report to support our financial eligibility reviews.</p>

<p>Please note that costs associated with laboratories or workshops should be included within the other costs section of the application form.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the direct overhead you should select ‘return to the overheads section’. You will return to the main overhead section where you will see a summary of your overhead claim for both direct and indirect overheads.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>   Due Diligence</h2>

<p>UK Space Agency will carry out due diligence on grant applications as required using internal and, where necessary, external subject matter experts. The scope and degree of due diligence will be determined by the value, nature and complexity of the grant scheme. All applications will be subject to basic checks such as credit reports and Companies House checks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Pre-award due diligence</h3>

<p>·    Financial assessment: organisation financial standing/health, assessment of project costs, aid intensity values and match funding contributions;</p>

<p>·    Economic impact / VFM assessment</p>

<p>·    Commercial: viability and / or commercial sustainability of the proposed solution, market position, demand and / or interest in technology, terms of the grant funding agreement; and / or</p>

<p>·    Programmatic: alignment to aims and objectives of the programme, programme plan which demonstrates the project can be delivered within the funding period and the critical path, risks and issues, details on project partners and / or subcontractors.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Post-award due diligence</h3>

<p>Post-award due diligence may include, but if not limited to:</p>

<p>·    Technical assessment of milestone deliverables against acceptance criteria to allow milestone payments to be released;</p>

<p>·    Financial: assessment of expenditure for each milestone payment and reporting on planned costs, follow up review of financial standing/health if it is a multi-year project</p>

<p>Grant Applicants who opt to work with project partners, companies involved in delivery of the project under a flow down agreement rather than a subcontractor, will assume all responsibility for partner due diligence.</p>

<p>Applicants will need to demonstrate they have carried out a sufficient level of due diligence with regard to their proposed project partners and subcontractors. Applicants will need to demonstrate they have carried out minimum checks at proposal stage, which may require further scrutiny if the proposal is to be funded.</p>

<p>To meet this requirement, applicants can provide evidence of due diligence carried out supported by the resulting information or submit a partner reasonable assurance statement. The evidence should be consistent with the checks that we would conduct on our Grant Recipients, for examples, financial standing, technical ability and scrutiny of the breakdown of costs. Any costs associated with project partner due diligence is considered a bidding cost and is to be borne by the applicant.</p>

<p>Applicants must provide evidence that they, and project partners have in place of appropriate anti-bribery and anti-corruption internal policies, and a process for declaring and managing conflicts of interest.</p>

The auditor will be appointed by UK Space Agency. All subcontractors and partners must provide access to project relevant expenditure. Therefore, Grant Recipients must maintain, and be able to provide upon request, any supporting evidenced as deemed necessary, such as:</p>

<p>·         Timesheets (prime and, where applicable, partners)</p>

<p>·         Staff costs (contractors)</p>
