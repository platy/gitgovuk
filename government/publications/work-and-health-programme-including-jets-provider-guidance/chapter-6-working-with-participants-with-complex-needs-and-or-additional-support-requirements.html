<h2>Introduction Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) &amp; Work and Health Programme: Job Entry Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.	The purpose of this chapter is to provide a single dedicated source of information related to working with all Participants who have complex needs and/or additional support requirements.</p>

<p>2.	Complex needs may be defined as difficult personal circumstances and/or life events. They may be permanent or temporary in nature and the degree to which they affect a Participant will vary from one person to another.</p>

<p>3.	The chapter explains the procedures you must follow to enable a Participant with complex needs and/or additional support requirements to access and use <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core provision and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> provision in a comparable way to other participants.</p>

<p>4.	The chapter also provides guidance on taking action, when appropriate, to ensure the safety and well-being of Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements.</p>

<h2>Disabled Participants (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>5.	For disabled Participants, you are legally required under the Equality Act 2010 to provide reasonable adjustments. Interaction with the Participant must determine what tailored support or reasonable adjustments they require to have equal access to products and services.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> notifies you that a Participant has complex needs and/or additional support requirements (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>6.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may notify you that a Participant has complex needs and/or additional support requirements at different points of the Participant’s time on provision. These include;</p>

<ul>
  <li>when referring the Participant to provision</li>
  <li>when notifying you of a change in a Participant’s circumstances</li>
  <li>via a notification from a decision maker following a sanction referral.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.	Please see Detailed background and further information for the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approach to identifying and supporting these Participants.</p>

<h2>Notification on referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>8.	When <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has identified that a Participant has complex needs/additional support requirements, they will notify you of this as part of the information they send to you to support the referral. You will be notified of this by the inclusion of the wording “May require reasonable adjustment or additional support” in a free text box on the Participant referral.</p>

<p>9.	You will need to carry out a number of actions to ensure that you are fully informed as to the Participant’s complex needs and put in place any reasonable adjustments to enable them to be able to attend and take part in the initial meeting (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or initial/first appointment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>). This could include interacting with the Participant in order to determine what tailored support and reasonable adjustments they will require to have equal access to products and services.</p>

<h2>Notification following a change in a Participant’s circumstances (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>10.	If Jobcentre Plus becomes aware that a Participant has developed complex needs and/or additional support requirements as a result of a change in their circumstances whilst they are on provision with you, they will notify you via a change of circumstances notification form CEPD1 or UC78e by adding the words ‘May require reasonable adjustment or additional support’.</p>

<p>11.	Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter10">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 10 Change of Circumstances and Notifications for details of the change of circumstances notification process</a>.</p>

<h2>Notification of changes throughout participation on Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>12.	At any point during a Participant’s time with you on provision, Jobcentre Plus may notify you that a Participant may require specialist help and/or additional support to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access and use your services for example: using on-line services and/or understanding letters and forms</li>
  <li>maintain conditionality, for example a Participant may have difficulty understanding a requirement to attend an appointment, undertake an activity or remember what evidence they need to provide</li>
  <li>maintain their finances</li>
  <li>understand information</li>
  <li>interpret situations</li>
  <li>make decisions</li>
  <li>give consent</li>
  <li>communicate information or their views.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>13.	The notification from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may detail the Participant’s specific needs or requirements. It may also simply inform you that a Participant has been identified as having complex needs and/or require additional support without providing any further details of the Participant’s specific needs or requirements. In either circumstance, you must ensure that you identify and address the Participant’s specific individual needs and support requirements to enable them to participate fully in your provision.</p>

<p>14.	This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discussing with the Participant (or if appropriate their representative or appointee) any support/reasonable adjustment the Participant requires.</li>
  <li>encouraging the Participant to share with you the information and activities agreed as part of their Claimant Commitment or claimant Action Plan along with any information they have from the results of their Work Capability Assessment (<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>15.	This should provide you with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an understanding of the level and type of activities a Participant has previously committed to undertake</li>
  <li>information you may use for comparison purposes following your own assessment of the Participants capability</li>
  <li>any adjustments that may have been made for the Participant which you should consider when agreeing activities and participation on the programme.</li>
</ul>

<p>16.	Where you are notified that a Participant has complex needs and/or additional support requirements, you should take special care to ensure that the Participant fully understands the benefit to themselves of sharing this information with you, and encourage them to do so.</p>

<p>17.	In exceptional circumstances, where the Participant will not share, or does not understand the importance of sharing information regarding their complex needs and/or additional support requirements, you should contact the Jobcentre Plus Gatekeeper (or alternative locally agreed contact) for further information.</p>

<p>18.	When the Jobcentre Plus Gatekeeper/local contact is not immediately available to answer your query, they will arrange a suitable alternative time to call you.</p>

<p>19.	The discussion with the Jobcentre Plus Gatekeeper/ local contact will focus on factual information based on an individual’s limitations and the additional support they may require to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintain conditionality (For example a Participant may have difficulty understanding a requirement to attend an appointment or undertake an activity or remember what evidence it is that they need to provide)</li>
  <li>maintain their finances</li>
  <li>understand information</li>
  <li>interpret situations</li>
  <li>make decisions</li>
  <li>give consent</li>
  <li>communicate information or their views</li>
  <li>require specialist help or support</li>
  <li>any reasonable adjustments that are required and have been made to access and use <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> services (for example, using on-line services or understanding letters and forms)</li>
  <li>activities agreed as part of their claimant commitment (providing you with an understanding of the level and type of activities a claimant has previously committed to undertake)</li>
  <li>details of the complex need/s and how that affects the claimant’s ability to use the services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>20.	You must ensure that your interaction with the Participant throughout their time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> is informed by their needs and requirements. You must ensure a clear support offer is in place enabling the Participant to access your provision and benefit from it in a comparable way to other Participants.</p>

<p>21.	When you have identified that a Participant has complex needs/additional support requirements you may make arrangements to tailor the level of engagement if this is required. In this situation you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree a tailored plan of support/additional support as agreed with the Participant</li>
  <li>if engagement is modified you should agree a date to re-engage with the Participant to review the situation and this date should be recorded in the Participants records.</li>
  <li>update the Participants Action Plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>22.	Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapoter10">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 10 Change of circumstances and notifications</a>.</p>

<p>23.	You must note on your systems the complex needs and/or additional support requirements that have been identified, and the support or reasonable adjustments that you have agreed with the Participant and put in place. This will form part of your evidence of two-way conversation and action planning. This evidence will be subject to validation and audit and must be retained in line with ESF document retention.</p>

<h2>Provider identifies that a Participant has complex needs and/or additional support requirements (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>26.	The Participant is on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> for a maximum of 182 calendar days (there is no in work support for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>). It is important that you continually monitor Participants to ascertain if there has been any change in their circumstances or condition that means they may now be considered to have complex needs or additional support requirements.</p>

<p>27.	In your meetings and communications with the Participant you should be aware of any signs that may indicate the Participant may have complex needs/ additional support requirements that have not been previously notified to you.</p>

<p>28.	A Participant may talk about a life event for example: bereavement or provide information in a conversation that suggests they may have complex personal circumstances. There may be a combination of factors which may indicate that a Participant may require additional support to fully participate in the Programme.</p>

<p>35.	When you have identified that a Participant has complex needs/additional support requirements you may make arrangements to tailor the level of engagement. In this situation you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree a tailored plan of support/additional support as agreed with the Participant</li>
  <li>if engagement is modified you should agree a date to re-engage with the Participant to review the situation and this date should be recorded in the Participants records.</li>
  <li>update the Participant’s Action Plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>36.	Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter10">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 10 Change of circumstances and notifications</a>.</p>

<p>37.	You must note on your systems the complex needs and/or additional support requirements that have been identified, and the additional support or reasonable adjustments that you have put in place and agreed with the Participant. This will form part of your evidence of two-way conversation and action planning. This evidence will be subject to validation and audit, and must be retained in line with ESF (England only) document retention.</p>

<p>38.	Not all Participants with life events/personal circumstances/ health issues/disability will require support.</p>

<p>39.	Participants may have one or multiple reasons why they require support. Support offered should be tailored to individual needs.</p>

<p>40.	It is possible that support will need to be put in place on a short, medium or long term basis, according to a Participant’s circumstances and requirements and that Participants may move in and out of situations where they do/do not require support.</p>

<h2>Proactive Disclosure where a Participant has complex needs and or additional support requirements (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>41.	Participants who have complex needs and/or additional support requirements may be at greater risk of abuse or neglect. They may be unable to take care of themselves or protect themselves against significant harm or exploitation.</p>

<p>42.	They may have difficulties dealing with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and provider processes which could affect their welfare and well-being and/or that of their family. They may find it difficult to gain access to your services because of, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>learning difficulties</li>
  <li>physical disabilities</li>
  <li>mental illness</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>restrictions due to Covid-19.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>43.	It is important you have policies in place which assist in the protection of vulnerable adults from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical abuse</li>
  <li>sexual abuse</li>
  <li>exploitation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children and Complex Needs - defined</h2>

<p>44.	For the purposes of this guidance, a child is defined as a person under the age of 18. Because of their age all children are classed as having complex needs/additional support requirements. It is important you have policies in place which assist in the protection of children from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical abuse</li>
  <li>sexual abuse</li>
  <li>exploitation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proactive Disclosure –providing information to third parties without a Participant or individuals consent (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>45.	If you are satisfied that a child or adult with complex needs/additional support requirements faces clear and significant risks to their welfare or safety, you are explicitly empowered by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy and relevant legislation (where you are acting as a data processor for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) to undertake any reasonable steps which you feel are necessary to address these risks.</p>

<p>46.	This includes, for example, concerns about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>risk of injury</li>
  <li>ill treatment</li>
  <li>neglect</li>
  <li>physical or sexual abuse</li>
  <li>exploitation of children or adults. The expectation is that action will be taken without undue delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>47.	You should volunteer information which is directly relevant to the issue of concern to Social Services or the Police as appropriate, with or without the Participant’s consent.</p>

<p>48.	In the case of a child, such information may be provided without the consent of the parents or guardian if a child’s welfare is at risk. You do not have to have to tell the parents or guardian about the disclosure. You should alert your management to any such disclosure.</p>

<p>49.	Any information given must be factual or relevant. You should provide the facts of the case and your concerns to the relevant body and only provide personal information such as name and address once they have confirmed they can take the issue forward.</p>

<p>50.	On some occasions Social Services may ask you to tell the Participant that you have informed Social Services and that they have to disclose the source of allegations made to them. There is, however, no obligation for you to inform the Participant that you have approached Social Services. If you have concerns that disclosure of your details would put your own safety as risk, you do not have to disclose any further details.</p>

<h2>Detailed background and further information (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>51.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may identify some claimants as having complex needs and/or as requiring additional support to enable them to access and use benefits and services.</p>

<p>52.	The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approach to supporting these claimants is based upon assessment of the impact of life events, personal circumstances, or health conditions on an individual’s ability to access and use benefits and services, and addressing these to ensure that their Participant journey is comparable in quality and outcome to that of Participants who have no complex needs or additional support requirements.</p>

<p>53.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may identify any Participant as having complex needs and/or requiring additional support depending upon their situation.</p>

<p>54.	Because of their age, a Participant who is under 18 is automatically considered to have complex needs and/or require additional support.</p>
