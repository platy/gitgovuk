<h2>Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>) <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participants</h2>

<p><strong>Sanction</strong> – A benefit sanction is a penalty imposed on a benefit claimant by the Department of Work and Pensions (the Department). It is a decrease or loss of a benefit when someone without good reason has not met conditions imposed by the Department.</p>

<p>1.	<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participants who have had a sanction imposed for failing to take part in the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) cannot limit the length of their sanction by subsequently complying with the Provider’s mandated requirements (re-compliance).</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Note the outcome on your systems.</li>
  <li>You must continue to engage with the <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant irrespective of the outcome</li>
</ul>

<h2>Provider considers that the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant has met the compliance condition</h2>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> it is vital you take the actions outlined in paragraphs 3-6 regardless of whether a sanction notification has been received.</p>

<p>2.	If a Participant has a low- level sanction and they meet the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approved compliance condition, their open- ended sanction period will end and a fixed term sanction period will be imposed. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance; Chapter 5a, Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a>.</p>

<h2>Provider notifies Universal Credit Decision Maker (<abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr>)</h2>

<p>3.	It is for you to decide if the Participant has met the compliance condition. A Participant can successfully re-comply by completing the required action you notified to them. The re-compliance date will be the date before the Participant met the compliance condition.</p>

<p>4.	When you are satisfied that the Participant has met their compliance condition you must complete the UC194 - Request to Review a Sanction for Universal Credit form  and send it to the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> straightaway.</p>

<h3>Please note</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Where a <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant fails to comply with a mandatory requirement and contacts you to rearrange the appointment or activity it may not be possible to accommodate them on the same day. In this scenario the appointment or activity must be rearranged for as soon as possible afterwards. Provided that the <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant subsequently attends and fully participates in the rearranged appointment or activity, the re-compliance date will be the date before they contacted you asking to rearrange.</li>
  <li>After sending the UC194, you will not be notified that the open-ended element of the sanction has been stopped and that a fixed sanction period has been applied.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>Decide whether the <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant has either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agreed to undertake the mandated activity or an alternative one that you mandate them to undertake.</li>
  <li>undertaken the compliance condition (where this is different to the mandated activity).</li>
  <li>is no longer required to undertake the mandated activity at that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	Notify the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> by using unencrypted e-mail to send the relevant form to the designated e-mail address.</p>

<p>6.	Before sending the e-mail, ensure that the e-mail standards are complied with. See section ‘Standard E-mail Content’ below.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> – If you are unable to use unencrypted e-mail, in exceptional circumstances such as complete IT failure, referrals by post will need to be sent securely to the Mail Opening Unit at:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Universal Credit 
<br>Post Handling Site B 
<br>Wolverhampton 
<br>WV99 1AJ 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>7.	For further information regarding sending documents securely please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Information Security</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Consequence</strong> 
<br><br>
If you fail to notify the Universal Credit (UC) Service Centre promptly when a Participant has met their compliance condition, there may be a delay in the open-ended sanction being lifted. This will prolong the LTU Participant’s loss of Universal Credit. Any delay in letting DWP know about a Participant meeting their compliance conditions may impact the claimant’s ability to apply for hardship payments.</p>
</div>

<h2>Standard E-mail Content</h2>

<p>8.	Each e-mail sent by you to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre must adhere to the standard e-mail protocols listed below to comply with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements.</p>

<p>9.	Each e-mail must contain ONLY the following standard content:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard wording to be displayed in e-mail ‘Subject Box’
    <ul>
      <li>Name of relevant form</li>
      <li>Participant’s surname</li>
      <li>NINO – only last three characters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Standard wording to be displayed in e-mail ‘Narrative Box’
    <ul>
      <li>Sender contact details</li>
      <li>E-mail attachment</li>
      <li>One UC194 form</li>
      <li>Each e-mail must never contain more than one form.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> - It is important that you adhere to these standards. Further information can be found Iater in this chapter in the section ‘Sending the the relevant form by Unencrypted E-mail’.</p>

<h2>Detailed Background and Further information</h2>

<h2>Sanction periods</h2>

<p>10.	Your internal systems need to be robust enough to enable you to identify <abbr title="Long-term unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participants you have raised a compliance doubt for.</p>

<p>11.	You will need to distinguish between <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and non-<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (Jobseekers Allowance) referrals to identify the correct action to take. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> referrals you must send re-compliance notifications even if a sanction decision has not yet been received.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> - You can only request a review of a Participant’s low level <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> sanction via the UC194 form, if you have raised the compliance doubt.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Labour Market regime changes and changes to sanction periods</h2>

<p>12.	If a change to a Participant’s circumstances results in a change to their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> labour market regime, then their participation requirements may also change. If they have a sanction in place, this may also be affected. It is therefore important that you are aware of changes in the Participant’s circumstances.</p>

<h3>For example:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant has an outstanding balance of any sanctions incurred whilst on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> or <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> this will transfer to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> with them, (unless the sanction decision was made after the <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>/<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> award terminated) less any periods in between awards where they were not receiving <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant is subject to a low -level sanction and their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award ends (other than by reason of a couple forming or splitting), the open- ended element of the sanction will stop building when the claim terminates and the fixed period will be applied.</li>
  <li>If a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant in the Intensive Work Search regime or Work Preparation regime moves into the No Work Related Requirements regime because of limited capability for work and work related activity, then their sanction reduction rate will be reduced to nil. The open-ended part of any outstanding sanctions will end.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Participant currently on a sanction</h2>

<p>13.	When a Participant has met their compliance condition the open- ended period of the sanction will stop on the day before the re-compliance date and the appropriate fixed period will start. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance; Chapter 5a, Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a>.</p>

<p>14.	Due consideration should be given to Participants you have identified or been notified as having complex needs and/or additional support requirements and any potential to meet their compliance condition should take into account their particular circumstances. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance; Chapter 6, Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements</a>.</p>

<p>15.	The open- ended element of the sanction can also be terminated by the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> if the Participant moves into the ‘No Work Related Requirements’ group and is no longer required to undertake the mandated activity or their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award ends (other than by reason of a couple forming or splitting).</p>

<h2>Participant has undertaken the agreed compliance condition</h2>

<p>16.	It is your responsibility to decide whether the level of re-compliance by the Participant satisfactorily meets the compliance condition. You will also need to decide the date from which you consider that the Participant has fully complied.</p>

<p>17.	If the Participant only partially meets the compliance condition, you will need to work with them and clearly explain what else they need to do in order to be fully compliant. Alternatively, due to the particular circumstances of the activity or of the Participant themselves, you may decide that partial completion is sufficient and request that the open period of the sanction be stopped.</p>

<p>18.	If the Participant contacts you, as they are unable to undertake the compliance condition, you can decide to agree a different compliance condition from the pre-approved list. If the Participant complies with the revised compliance condition, the date of compliance is taken as the date that they contacted you.</p>

<p>19.	If the compliance condition involves attending a meeting, compliance will normally be the date the Participant attends the meeting. However, if you are unable to accommodate the Participant on the day, they make contact and you have to arrange the meeting for a subsequent date, the compliance date will be the date the Participant makes contact, provided that they attend the subsequent meeting. If the Participant does not attend the subsequent meeting, the open-ended period will continue to run from the date of the original failure until the Participant makes contact again.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant no longer required to undertake the mandated activity</h2>

<p>20.	You may decide that you no longer require the Participant to carry out the mandated activity (original or compliance condition). This situation may arise due to a change in the Participant’s circumstances, work goals or that it was a time bound activity (such as attending a specific job fair) and there are no alternative similar activities to undertake.</p>

<p>21.	In this case the requirement to undertake the activity is removed. The UC194 form must be completed and sent to the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> to remove the open period of the sanction.</p>

<h2>Participant disputes not meeting compliance condition</h2>

<p>22.	There may be instances when the Participant considers that they have now fully met the compliance condition which you have set for them but you do not consider that they have.</p>

<p>23.	In cases where meeting the compliance condition is disputed and you cannot reach agreement with the Participant, you must immediately refer the matter to the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> on the UC194 form as appropriate so they can review the case and determine whether the Participant has now fully complied.</p>

<p>24.	Tick the box ‘I consider that the Participant has not fully complied’ as the reason for referral on form. Enter the original date of sanction decision, dates of sanction and complete the fields in the ‘Compliance disputed’ section. You must then provide specific details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the Participant was told to do and when</li>
  <li>what the Participant did do or failed to do and when</li>
  <li>why you consider the Participant has failed to complete the activity</li>
  <li>why the Participant considers they have completed the activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>25.	To complete the last field, make a note of what the Participant tells you.</p>

<h2>Re-arranging a mandated activity prior to activity date</h2>

<p>26.	You do not need to complete a compliance doubt referral form UC193 (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) if prior to the Participant undertaking the mandated activity, they contact you because they are not able to undertake the activity. You can decide to re-arrange the activity. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance; Chapter 5a, Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a>.</p>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr>
</h2>

<p>27.	When you have made the decision that the Participant has met their compliance condition you must complete the UC194 form.</p>

<p>28.	The UC194 form needs to be sent straightaway to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre. Delays in this process will mean delays to the decision making process.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> - If you are using unencrypted e-mail <strong>any</strong> additional information must not be communicated by unencrypted e-mail. Any additional information must be communicated by letter and sent securely to the Mail Opening Unit at:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
	
Universal Credit
<br>Post Handling
<br>Site B Wolverhampton 
<br>WV99 1AJ 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>29.	If the Participant re-complies prior to the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> making a decision on the original mandatory activity and notifying you, complete the UC194 form and send it to the Service Centre immediately.</p>

<h2>Completing the Form</h2>

<p>30.	To ensure that the Participant suffers no undue loss of Universal Credit, the UC194 should be completed and sent to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre immediately after you have decided that they have met their compliance condition. On the form, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>indicate the reason for requesting a review by selecting the appropriate reason(s)</li>
  <li>complete the date the Participant failed to undertake the original mandatory activity</li>
  <li>determine the date of compliance and this date should be entered in the appropriate field.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> - if you have ticked the box ‘it is no longer appropriate for the Participant to undertake that activity’, you should not complete the date of compliance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the date that the sanction decision was made and the date of the sanction period. (You will find this on the original sanction decision notification, sent to you). This will enable the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> to identify the correct sanction to review.</li>
</ul>

<p>31.	The <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> will accept your decision that the Participant has met their compliance condition and will set the start and end dates for the fixed period part of the sanction.</p>

<h2>Sending the UC194 by Unencrypted E-mail</h2>

<p>32.	Ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the completed UC194 is sent to the correct designated e-mail address</li>
  <li>each e-mail must never contain more than one UC194</li>
  <li>no other information may be transmitted to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre by unencrypted e-mail</li>
  <li>the UC194 is sent from an inbox that was agreed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Do not use a personal e-mail address</li>
  <li>the ‘Provider Address’ field should contain the postal address to which any queries or further correspondence should be sent by Decision Makers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Customer Records and <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>
</h2>

<p>33.	If the Participant is identified as a Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) or they have Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) status, the completion of the relevant form remains clerical (even if you use unencrypted e-mails). These Participants must not have their details held on any electronic systems. The process for requesting a review of a sanction decision (or for raising a compliance doubt via the relevant form) will remain clerical for these Participants.</p>

<p>34.	Your Nominated Officer should complete the UC194, clearly marked ‘<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant’ and sent it securely to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
	
Mail Opening Unit 
<br>Universal Credit Post Handling Site B 
<br>Wolverhampton
