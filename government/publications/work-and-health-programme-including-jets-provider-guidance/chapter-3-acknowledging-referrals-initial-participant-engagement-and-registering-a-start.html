<h2>Referral</h2>

<p>1.	You will need to work with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and your local Jobcentre Plus contacts to ensure an effective referral and engagement process with the Participant.</p>

<p>Information will be transmitted to you via the Provider Referrals and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>) system interface.</p>

<p>2.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Provider acknowledges referral</h2>

<p>3.	You are required to ‘acknowledge’ the Participants referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> within two working days of referral being received by you. This is an existing Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>) on which you are performance managed. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter16">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 16: Performance Management, Assurance and Compliance Monitoring</a>.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Access <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Acknowledge Referral.</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Consequence: Failure to acknowledge a referral will mean that you will be unable to record a start date and therefore you will be unable to receive any outcomes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Referral - Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr>) cases</h2>

<p>4.	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases who have not been given Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) status will be referred through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The nominated officer from Jobcentre Plus will contact your nominated officer to give contact details and any restrictions that may be imposed on the Participant.</li>
  <li>Take the same action on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> as for non-<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases to acknowledge and start the Participant.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Referral - <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> (including <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status)</h2>

<p>6.	Participants who have been granted <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status will be referred to you clerically via the SL2 process. There is no clerical equivalent of acknowledging an electronic referral for <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> cases, so this step does not apply in these instances.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will complete page one (of three) of the SL2 form, forwarding the entire form to your nominated officer.</li>
  <li>Undertake start activity following receipt of SL2 form from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (retaining pages two and three of the SL2 form) and complete and return page one to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> nominated officer.</li>
  <li>Send a photocopy of page two of the SL2 form to the Provider Payment Validation Team (<abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>7.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Initial engagement activity</h2>

<p>8.	You must engage with the Participant by discussing the programme with them and book an initial meeting with them, which may be by telephone call, video conference or any other method permitted by the contract, sending out details to the Participant to confirm. This can be via email if remote delivery means no access to post (for voluntary Participants).</p>

<p>9.	You may choose to mandate Long Term Unemployed (<abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr>) Participants who were referred to you on or after 9 May 2022 to attend this meeting.
Any mandatory appointments must be notified by the appropriate <abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr> (Mandatory Activity Notification). If it has not been possible to contact the Participant, you should still book an initial meeting, sending out details to the Participant to confirm.</p>

<p>10.	The initial meeting must take place and be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> within 15 working days of you receiving the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> referral to meet the <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.	The initial meeting should take place on a one-to-one basis.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Contact by appropriate means to discuss the programme with them.</li>
  <li>Make arrangements for the initial meeting, confirming this in writing or email for voluntary Participants. If you choose to mandate a <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant to the meeting you must use the appropriate Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>) letter to do this. You must also ensure you comply with the requirements contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5a - Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a>.</li>
  <li>Keep a record of the actions you have taken to contact the Participant to arrange the initial meeting and by what means (that is, telephone, email or letter).</li>
  <li>Take into account any complex needs and/or additional support requirements as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 - Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>12.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Initial meeting</h2>

<p>13.	Once the Participant engages in the initial meeting they have started on programme.</p>

<p>14.	The initial meeting must take place within 15 working days of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> referral being received by you to meet your Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>). It must also be recorded on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> within 15 working days to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>15.	Where the initial meeting does not take place within 15 working days and you have not entered a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) code in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>, you will fail to meet <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> 3. You may still engage with the Participant, however please note that you only have 60 calendar days from the referral being made in which to register a start. Following this time, the line will be automatically closed in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check the Participants ID.</li>
  <li>Check that the Participant is not in any form of employment including zero hour contracts.  For further information where a Participant finds work or receives a job offer between referral and the initial  meeting please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#participant">Participant starts work or has a job offer between referral and start</a> section of this chapter.</li>
  <li>Capture the Participants preferred method of communication at this meeting and begin action planning with them.</li>

Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5a - Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a>.</li>
  <li>Take into account any complex needs and/or additional support requirements and ensure this is recorded in the Action Plan.

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Now that all COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery, all documents which require a Participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the Participant. For Non-<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants if the signature box is annotated ‘COVID- 19’ or ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’ you are not required to obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person.</p>

<h2>European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) 2014-2020 Programme and Work and Health Programme provision eligibility, evidence requirements and initial activity (England only)</h2>

<p>16.	Work and Health Programme is <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funded in England only, it will therefore be subject to stringent audit by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) Auditors. They will require evidence that the programme is being delivered in accordance with the contract and all payments are clearly and appropriately evidenced. Failure to meet these audit requirements can result in financial penalties or withdrawal of funding.</p>

<p>17.	To be eligible for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 all Participants must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>legally resident and have the right to take paid employment in the United Kingdom (<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>)</li>
  <li>aged 16 or over.</li>
</ul>

<p>18.	For Participants in receipt of benefit a referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can be considered as confirmation that they have the right to work and reside in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>19.	For Participants not in receipt of benefit it is your responsibility to gather and retain evidence of right to work and reside in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>20.	From January 1st 2021, European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) nationals already in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> must meet one of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold settled status granted under the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Settlement Scheme (<abbr title="EU Settlement Scheme">EUSS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>hold pre-settled status granted under the <abbr title="EU Settlement Scheme">EUSS</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>21.	<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals arriving in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> from the 1st January 2021 must hold leave to remain with permission to work granted under the new Points Based Immigration system to be eligible for the Work and Health Programme.</p>

<p>22.	<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> nationals and their family members who are lawfully resident in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by 31 December 2020 (the end of the transition period) but have yet to apply for status under the <abbr title="EU Settlement Scheme">EUSS</abbr>, will have their rights protected during the grace period which ends on 30 June 2021 (and until the final determination of any <abbr title="EU Settlement Scheme">EUSS</abbr> application made by that date). They will therefore be eligible for the Work and Health Programme.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> These customers are identified as a non-benefit customer at referral.</p>

<p>23.	 Further information may be found in the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> You should not keep copies of identification for example passports, birth certificates you should note the reference/serial number of these documents and hand them back. All other evidence should be copied and retained. For further information on evidence requirements please refer to The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-eligibility-documents"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide</a>.</p>

<p>24.	For Participants in Early Access Disadvantaged Groups you are required to obtain evidence of their Work and Health Programme eligibility in the category they have identified with, that is care leaver, refugee etc. The Early Access category will be stated in the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Third party evidence is the preferred format however a self-declaration may be used where third party evidence is unavailable/not appropriate which may be the case for some of the Early Access groups.</p>

<p>25.	Eligibility evidence should be obtained prior to the completion of the ESF14¬20m European Social Fund Match Participant Form (Initial).</p>

<p>26.	For further information regarding the preferred list of evidence and information about recording a Participants labour market status please refer to:</p>

<p>The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make the Participant aware of support they will receive from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and issue the ESF2020 leaflet. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2020  leaflet can be emailed to Participants using the electronic version published on the Gov.<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> website along with all other <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14-20 Guidance. If a Participant does not have an email address you must ensure the Participant is aware of the information the form contains verbally and arrange to post it to them at the earliest opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also remind the Participant of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support throughout their time on provision and have evidence to support this audit requirement.</p>

<p>An <strong>ESF1420m form (Initial)</strong> must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fully completed for each eligible Participant.</li>
  <li>correct, including where information is collected directly from Participants, the gender identity of Participants should be recorded (that is, the gender that the Participant wishes to be identified with).</li>
  <li>completed jointly with the Participant.</li>
  <li>signed by the Participant on the start date. The start date is the point at which the Participant begins to engage with the programme. This is the initial meeting between the provider and the Participant.</li>
</ul>

<p>27. As all COVID restrictions have been lifted and the updated Government advice has progressed to ‘Living with COVID-19’ it is no longer appropriate for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>-related paperwork, completed when delivering provision remotely, to contain ‘COVID-19’ in lieu of a signature from 7 May 2022.</p>

<p>28. The preferred method of delivery is still face to face. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained, and retrospective signatures should be attained when the participant is next seen in person and such form/s retained on file for audit.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Obtaining retrospective signatures face to face only applies to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>29. Whilst the department supports a blended delivery model, but this must be based on participant need. Where remote delivery does take place, you should annotate the signature box with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’. ‘COVID-19’ wording will not be accepted on any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 1420 Initial and End forms submitted from 7 May 2022.</p>

<p>30.	Your records should clearly state why remote delivery was the most appropriate and email evidence (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme if no wet signature has been obtained.</p>

<p>31. The Department recommends that you follow the relevant country specific Government guidelines in relation to safety and only see those participants who request or agree to receive face to face support for all voluntary Participants. Where a virtual appointment is made (at Participants request) and is not due to Government Guidelines you should clearly hold a record of the request for example how the request was made and the details, for audit trail and future inspection.</p>

<p>32. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained.  Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>33.	Where you have not been able to obtain signatures from Participants for any forms that require them, and the reason for that is not related to any Government Guidelines you were following at the time, you will need to clearly show that all reasonable attempts were made; date and evidence those attempts for your own audit trail and future inspection.</p>

<p>34. The COVID-19 period easements are no longer to be used. If you are not seeing the participant face to face you should annotate documentation where signatures are required with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’.</p>

<p>35.	You should refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance chapter-11b European Social Fund(<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Requirements 2014 –2020</a> (England Only) for further information.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Where a Participant is unable to sign the ESF1420m form (Initial) due to a disability for example you must ensure ‘Participant unable to sign’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant unable to sign”. In these cases a mark such as an “x” will be acceptable as a signature, however the identification evidence must be aligned to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirement.</li>
  <li>The fully completed ESF1420m form (Initial) must be sent back to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within five working days of Participant signature.</li>
  <li>Where you are aware that the Participant has <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> restrictions with <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> or is an <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> case, you should send ESF1420m form (Initial) clerically to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Administrative Team.

  <li>In the exceptional circumstance that the evidence cannot be obtained it is essential you still complete an ESF1420m form (Initial) and annotate accordingly as detailed in bullets below.</li>
  <li>In the exceptional circumstances that the Participant has refused to provide evidence, you must ensure ‘Participant Evidence Refusal’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant Evidence Refusal.” when emailing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the ESF1420m form (Initial).</li>
  <li>In the exceptional circumstances that a Participant refuses to sign the ESF1420m form (Initial) you must ensure ‘Participant Refuses to sign’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant Refuses to sign” when notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If neither ‘Participant refusal to sign’ or ‘Participant unable to sign’ is on the referral email subject field but the Participant signature is missing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reject the ESF1420m form (Initial) and send it back to you for correction.</li>
</ul>

<p>36.	As COVID restrictions have now eased you should refer to paragraphs 27-35 above. Evidence must be retained for the initial interview and must be retained in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> document retention requirements. For further information, please refer to The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide.</p>

<h2>Erroneous Referrals</h2>

<p>58.	Situations may arise where Participants have been referred in error to the Work and Health Programme. This may be because the Participant was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorrectly referred to the Work and Health Programme when the allocation from the Random Allocation Tool (RAT) was either the Public Sector Comparator or the Random Control Group referred to the Work and Health Programme without interaction with the RAT</li>
  <li>referred under the incorrect opportunity type that is, Devolution Deal area (<abbr title="Devolution Deal area">DDA</abbr>) instead of non-<abbr title="Devolution Deal area">DDA</abbr> areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>59.	These Participants are eligible for the programme and the appropriate action should be taken to start the Participant. For further information on starting a Participant on the Work and Health Programme, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#registers">Provider registers a start</a> section detailed in this chapter.</p>

<h3>Participant referred as voluntary Participant when they should be a mandatory Participant.</h3>

<p>60.	Situations may arise when a Participant has been referred in error under the incorrect customer group.</p>

<p>61.	These Participants will remain on the initial referral and continue participating on a voluntary basis, until they disengage. You should continue to support the Participant as a voluntary Participant until notified otherwise.</p>

<p>64.	Upon receipt of the CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form you must update the Participants record and ensure that the Participant receives the correct support now they are a mandatory Participant.</p>

<h3>Participant referred as a mandatory Participant when they should be a voluntary Participant</h3>

<p>65.	When the error is identified you will be notified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via a change of Circumstances CEPD1 or UC78e and you should pause interaction with the Participant.</p>

<p>68.	If the Participant decides to leave the programme, you will be notified by Jobcentre Plus via a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>69.	Upon receipt of the CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form you should take the most appropriate action to cancel the referral. For further information on cancelling a referral, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#ineligible">Participant is ineligible for the Work and Health Programme</a> section detailed in this chapter.</p>

<h2>Participant contact</h2>

<p>74.	The frequency and means (for example text, email) by which you contact Participants will be driven by your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> and the Participants preferred method of contact must be recorded on your systems and followed.</p>

<h2>Identity checks</h2>

<p>75.	You must ensure that in all communications with Participants you are satisfied you are engaging with the correct person.</p>

<p>76.	To do this, you may decide to ask them to state a combination of their personal information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>

  <li>other information, such as details that were included within the original referral from Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>details you hold on your records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initial engagement (activity prior to initial meeting)</h2>

<p>77.	 If a Participant contacts you before the initial meeting,  to say that they are unable to participate in an initial meeting, you may consider making arrangements to reschedule the meeting in line with your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>.</p>

<p>78.	 If you mandated the Participant to attend the meeting, you may also, after considering the request, still require the Participant to attend the original appointment.</p>

<p>79.	If a Participant who you have mandated to attend the initial meeting, fails to attend, you must raise a compliance doubt referral on the appropriate referral form. Further details may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5a – Mandation to Activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter8">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Raising a Compliance Doubt for <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> participants</a>.</p>

<p>80. You should continue to try to engage with the Participant and enable their attendance up until Day 15 of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> target period, and not input the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> code before Day 15, except where the Participant contacts you to rearrange their appointment and you are unable to do so within your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> target timescales.</p>

<p>81.	If a voluntary Participant refuses to participate in the initial meeting you must address the Participants concerns regarding attending. If the Participant still refuses to attend then you should enter the date and completer reason ‘2 – <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>’ into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> to end their time on programme.</p>

<p>82.	Jobcentre Plus will then run a report and invite the Participant in for an interview to understand the reasons why they haven’t attended.</p>

<h2>Action Planning – minimum requirements</h2>

<p>90.	Following the initial engagement and initial meeting with the Participant, you should begin high level initial action planning activity.</p>

<p>91. You must complete an Action Plan which has been signed and finalised by you and the Participant, within 20 working days of receipt of the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. When you are delivering face-to-face, a wet signature must be obtained. If the action plan was agreed remotely , you must annotate it as  ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’ and keep a record of this conversation. This is a part of the <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> on which you are performance managed.</p>

<p>92.	If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’, when Government Restrictions were in place, you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit. Further information can be found in Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 16 - Performance Management, Assurance and Compliance Monitoring. This only applies to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>93.	This initial action planning must capture evidence of any activities you agree with the Participant.</p>

<p>94.	You must make it clear to mandatory <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> claimants where activities are mandatory. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5a - Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5b">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5b - Mandation to activity attracting a Higher Level sanction</a>.</p>

<p>95.	You must ensure that, as a minimum, Participants have access to all ongoing requirements in a single document that is available to them at their request. This should include a clear explanation of what each activity is, when it occurs, when it must be completed by and what evidence is required to demonstrate completion of the activity.</p>

<p>96.	You must record any complex needs or additional support requirements. Further information can be found in Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 6 – Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements.</p>

<p>97.	In England only, a completed ESF1420m form (initial) and proof of high level initial action planning activity is evidence to support the Participants start on programme for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> purposes. You must ensure that this evidence is documented and stored in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements. Further information can be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England only).</p>

<p>98. Now that all Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery, Action Plans should be signed and dated by you and the participant.  If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ from previous government COVID-19 restrictions, you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such forms should be retained on file, for audit.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Obtaining retrospective signatures retrospectively applies only to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants still on programme.</p>

<p>99. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained.  Where remote delivery is taking place due to customer needs, evidence of participation in the programme should be retained and forms annotated with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’ from the 7 May 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> It is essential that you retain robust evidence of the two-way conversation and evidence of initial high level action planning activity. This evidence will be subject to validation, audit and the evidence must be retained in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> document retention requirements. Where the Participant refuses to agree the initial action plan you must record this on your systems.</p>

<h2>Provider registers a start</h2>

<p>100.	The <strong>Start</strong> is the point at which the Participant participates in their initial meeting with you. The date of the initial meeting should be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> as the start date; this may be a retrospective date if you are entering the start date after the meeting was conducted.</p>

<p>101.	You must retain evidence of the start date. Examples of acceptable evidence will include (in England) an appropriately completed ESF1420m form (initial), or evidence of initial action planning activity.</p>

<p>102.	The <strong>Start Date</strong> is day one of the 456 calendar day period that you have to work with the Participant. Where the Participant requires in work support their time on the programme may be extended, up to a maximum of 639 calendar days - Further information can be found in Work and Health Programme Provider Chapter 14 – Validation.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases</h2>

<p>103.	The <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> are the statutory arrangements for managing sexual, violent and certain other offenders in the community in Scotland, England and Wales.</p>

<p>104.	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> is not a statutory body but a mechanism through which agencies can better discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated manner.</p>

<p>105.	<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases who have not been given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status will be referred through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Procedure for <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases</h2>

<p>106.	The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> nominated officer will contact your nominated officer to discuss any restrictions that should be in place for each <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> referral. They may decide to forward to you a copy of the <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J form which will detail the restrictions. Risks or restrictions will be different for every <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> case.</p>

<p>107.	The <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> J form and any other clerical documents for each claim must be held securely, with restricted access, following the same process as you would for SL2’s.</p>

<p>108.	The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> nominated officer will also provide you with the Participants contact details.</p>

<p>109.	You can set up normal electronic records on your IT systems for <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Participants. However, the record must only contain minimal information and should be marked training and employment restrictions apply and that further information can be obtained from your nominated officer. Therefore, access to this record does not need to be restricted.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> - including <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status</h2>

<p>110.	Certain Participants are allocated <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status, for cases where unrestricted access to Participants data poses a demonstrable risk to the individual’s safety. These Participants must not have their details held on any electronic systems. Participants who have been granted <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status will always be referred to you clerically using the SL2 clerical referral form. There is no requirement for clerical cases to be acknowledged.</p>

<p>111.	In rare cases, some <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> Participants may be given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status. You must ensure that you treat these cases as you would any other <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant. Access to a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> must be restricted to a set period of time and on an event-by-event basis.</p>

<h2>Procedure for <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> cases - including <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> cases given <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status</h2>

<p>112.	You must ensure you have a full understanding of who these Participants are and how you should deal with them. You must ensure full compliance with the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> clerical record process.</p>

<p>113.	The clerical completion and return of SL2 Forms for <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants should always be undertaken by your nominated officer, who must ensure that “<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant” is clearly marked at the top of each form.</p>

<p>114.	All information on <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants whether received from Jobcentre Plus or generated by yourselves must be stored securely at all times.</p>

<p>115.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expects you to have effective processes in place to meet all the above requirement and be able to demonstrate that you have conducted the necessary actions.</p>
