<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Change of Circumstances <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core (Disengagement/Re-engagement)</h2>

<p>1.	There are two occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on the core Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>). These are when a voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit has disengaged with you or when a Participant has re-engaged with you following a period of disengagement. This only applies to voluntary Participants in receipt of benefit - and there is no requirement to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of disengagement/re-engagement for a mandatory Participant or a voluntary Participant who is not in receipt of benefit.</p>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant disengages with you, as per the criteria stated in your tender using the change of circumstances notification form (WHP07) sent via unencrypted email.</li>
  <li>Where a change in Participant circumstances has resulted in disengagement it is important that you identify any complex needs and/or additional support that they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity.</li>
  <li>Continue to attempt to make contact and re-engage with the Participant pending the return of the CEPD1/UC78e from Jobcentre Plus as agreed in your tender for the duration of the programme (this could be up to 456 calendar days <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) unless you have been informed that a voluntary Participant does not want any further contact.</li>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant re-engages on the WHP07 notification form sent by unencrypted email.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Further detail is provided on unencrypted email process in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fb">detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Change of Circumstances <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> (Disengagement/Re-engagement)</h2>

<p>2.	There are three occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on the Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>). These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant after their start on the programme, has disengaged with you.</li>
  <li>after having started on the programme when a Participant has re-engaged with you, following a period of disengagement</li>
  <li>after a change in the Participant’s circumstance and through discussions with them, you jointly identify that alternative provision may better support the Participant. This must be in agreement with Jobcentre Plus.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, disengagement <strong>after starting</strong> on the programme is defined as a Participant failing to attend appointments, or complete activities (as agreed with the provider) and the provider has tried to re-engage with them at least three times within 10 working days from the date of the missed appointment. The first attempt being within two working days, or within any alternative contact arrangement period that they have agreed with the Participant.</p>

<p><strong>For example,</strong> if the agreed alternative contact agreement was for contact every 20 days, the attempts at contact before considering disengagement action would be three attempts at re-engagement within the 20 days.</p>

<p>4.	Where an individual is mandated to attend and participate in the first appointment and fails to attend prior to starting on the programme you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3b">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 3b Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start for further details</a>.</p>

<h2>Disengagement Process after starting on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant disengages with you as defined on paragraphs 2 and 3 above using the change of circumstances notification form (WHP07) sent via unencrypted email.</li>
  <li>If a Participant fails to attend an appointment or undertake agreed activities with you after they have attended the initial appointment /first appointment and started on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, you must attempt to contact the Participant on 3 separate occasions within 10 working days (or alternative contact timescale if agreed). The first attempt being within two working days.</li>
  <li>You must update your records for each attempt. If you fail to re-engage with the Participant within this timescale, you must notify Jobcentre Plus via a WHP07 of the Participants’ disengagement.</li>
  <li>Once you have notified Jobcentre Plus of the Participant disengagement do not enter an early completer code into Provider Referral and Payment System (PRaP). The referral will remain open for the duration of the 182 calendar days’ time on the programme to enable re-engagement if appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Further detail is provided on unencrypted email process in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fb">detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Circumstances where a Participant disengages from the programme and you don’t need to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</h2>

<p>5.	When, after starting on the programme, a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Participant has informed you that they wish to disengage from the programme because they require no further support, you are not required to inform Jobcentre Plus of this.</p>

<p>6.	You should attempt to discuss and agree a contact arrangement with the Participant for the remainder of their time on the programme to enable them to access any additional support they may require. You must record the outcome of this discussion in the Participant’s records. Do not enter an early completer code into PRaP.</p>

<p>7.	The referral will remain open for the duration of the 182 calendar days’ time on the programme to enable re-engagement if appropriate.</p>

<h2>Participant has a change in circumstances that affects their engagement on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</h2>

<p>8.	Where a change in a Participant circumstance has resulted in disengagement it is important that you identify any complex needs and/or additional support that they may require. You should take any appropriate steps/action to support and encourage the Participants re engagement to enable them to continue their time on provision.</p>

<p>9.	Further information regarding complex needs can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter9">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Detailed background and further information</h2>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Disengagement/Re-engagement</h2>

<h2>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core Programme</h2>

<h3>Disengaged Process – No contact with Voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit</h3>

<p>43.	Disengagement is when a Participant is no longer interacting with you for a continued period as agreed in your tender; this may also be part of your agreed delivery model. The process applies only after a Participant has started on the programme. The purpose of this process is to assist you to re-engage with a Participant who you have been unable to contact by triggering an interaction with Jobcentre Plus to establish why they have disengaged.</p>

<p>44.	You should notify Jobcentre Plus immediately when a voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit has met your disengagement criteria as set out in your tender and you have not been able to make contact. You should complete a WHP07 form and send by unencrypted email, advising of the last date the Participant engaged with you.</p>

<p>45.	The disengagement process should be followed if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attempted to re-engage with the Participant in line with your tender and not been able to make contact</li>
  <li>not received any notification from Jobcentre Plus to inform you of a change of circumstances on a CEPD1 or UC78e.</li>
</ul>

<p>46.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the first day you deem a voluntary Participant to have disengaged from the programme and send one WHP07 per Participant by unencrypted email.</p>

<p>47.	When notifying Jobcentre Plus of disengagement the WHP07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Work Coach. The email subject field must contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participant Disengagement or Engagement</li>
  <li>Participants surname</li>
  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>48.	If a Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) Participant has disengaged with you, your Nominated Officer should complete the change of circumstances form, ensure that it is marked clearly that the claimant is a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant and send it to the Nominated Officer in the relevant Jobcentre Plus office by a secure postal service. Further information may be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 2 - Delivering Provision.</p>

<p>49.	A Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will contact the Participant to discuss participation in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you of the outcome of this interview on a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>50.	In cases where a change of circumstances may have contributed to the Participants disengagement it is important that you refer to  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 –Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a> and identify any complex needs and/or additional support they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity.</p>

<h2>Disengaged Process – Contact with Voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>51.	A WHP07 is still required to be completed even though there is contact with the Participant and the Participant has asked you not to contact them.</p>

<p>52.	Where a Participant has asked you not to contact them. The Participants request should be adhered to and their file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file. In this scenario you should complete a WHP07 to inform Jobcentre Plus that the Participant has disengaged and wants no further contact.</p>

<h3>Actions to take when a WHP07 has been sent (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h3>

<p>53.	Where you have sent the WHP07 to the Jobcentre to instigate contact with a Work Coach you have a responsibility to endeavour to contact and re-engage with the Participant as agreed in your tender for the duration of the programme (this could be up to 456 calendar days). This does not apply where a voluntary Participant has already advised that they do not want any further contact.</p>

<p>54.	Therefore, if you have still had no contact from the Participant, and not received a CEPD1/UC78e from Jobcentre Plus, then you must attempt to re-engage as per the re-engagement process in your tender.</p>

<p>55.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file.</p>

<p>56.	If the Participant decides to re-engage at any point during the remainder of the 456 calendar days Jobcentre Plus will signpost the Participant back to you for the balance of time. If the Participant has notified you directly then you will complete a WHP07 to advise that Jobcentre Plus that they have re-engaged.</p>

<h2>Circumstances that are not considered disengagement - WHP07 not required (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>57.	The disengagement process should not be followed and a WHP07 is not required to be completed in the following circumstances as there is contact with the Participant when you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make arrangements to tailor the level of engagement with a Participant who you are in contact with due to a change in circumstances, for example a Participant may have an operation and require two-weeks recovery</li>
  <li>receive a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances notification from Jobcentre Plus where you may be asked to suspend or reduce engagement due to an easement (usually for a finite period of time).</li>
</ul>

<p>58.	As per bullet one above, it is possible that a Participants participation will be affected by a change of circumstances or period of ill health. In these circumstances it may be appropriate to tailor engagement. Further information is held in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 –Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a>, provides details around complex needs and additional support - tailoring the level of engagement with a Participant forms part of this.</p>

<h2>Re-engagement – Completion of WHP07 for Voluntary Participants in receipt of benefit (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>59.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the WHP07 change of circumstances notification form and send by unencrypted email when the Participant re-engages with you.</p>

<h2>Voluntary Participant not in receipt of benefit stops engaging with you (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>61.	If a non-benefit claiming Participant disengages, you do not need to report this change to Jobcentre Plus. You have a responsibility to endeavour to make contact and re-engage with the Participant throughout this period as agreed in your tender.</p>

<p>62.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file.</p>

<p>63.	Where a change of circumstances may have contributed to the Participants disengagement it is important that you refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a> and identify any complex needs and/or additional support they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity and agree the appropriate level of interaction.</p>

<p>64.	A non-benefit Participant referral will be identified on PRaP and it is your responsibility to maintain accurate records to ensure this information is up to date.</p>

<p>66.	Where a Participant is receiving <abbr title="In-Work-Support">IWS</abbr> and you have been unable to contact them a WHP07 should not be sent to Jobcentre Plus to notify of disengagement. In these circumstances you must still try and contact the Participant.</p>

<p>67.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why, if a reason is provided.</p>

<h3>Self-Employment whilst on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</h3>

<p>113.	When a Participant report that they are self-employed, or a partner that is already self-employed joins an existing claim, a Jobcentre Plus Gateway Interview is needed to provide an assessment of whether the Participant and/or partner is in gainful self-employment for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes. You should advise the Participant to telephone the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Service Centre to arrange a Gateway Interview to disclose their self-employment.</p>

<p>114.	Further information on the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> self-employment gateway interview can be found in the section covering Overview of the Self Employment Gateway Interview of this Chapter.</p>

<p>115.

<p>116.	It is for the Participant to meet the requirements for declaring as <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Self-employed, however it would be to your advantage to ensure they are complying with the requirements as <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will access pertinent data within a Participants <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> record to determine if they are gainfully self-employed.</p>

<p>117.

<p>119.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify the outcome of the interview on a UC78e change of circumstances form. If the Participant is gainfully self-employed and a start-up period is appropriate, they should also include the start and end dates.</p>

<p>120.	If the Participant is treated as being gainfully self-employed, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will book a subsequent self-employed quarterly interview to take place at three, six and nine month stages. At the end of each quarterly interview (or at any other time when a change is reported), the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you if the Participant: any other time when a change is reported), the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you if the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has ceased self-employment</li>
  <li>start-up period has come to an end</li>
  <li>is no longer gainfully self-employed.</li>
  <li>remains gainfully self-employed, but have not taken sufficient steps to increase their earnings during a start-up period. Where the start-up period ends, the Participant’s Labour Market Regime will be amended to Working Enough Regime if they would otherwise fall within the Intensive Work Search Regime and their participation becomes voluntary.</li>
</ul>

<p>121.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will inform you of any change to the Participant’s labour market regime and work search and work availability requirements.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant / partner refuses to accept Claimant Commitment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>123.	As part of entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> the Participant will have a Claimant Commitment specifying the work related requirements they must complete. In the case of a couple, each will have their own Claimant Commitment. Jobcentre Plus is responsible for reviewing and updating the Participant’s Claimant Commitment to reflect any changes to the claim or their conditionality.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants must accept their Claimant Commitment but there is no requirement for them to sign it.</p>

<p>124.	If the Participant or, in the case of a household/joint claim, their partner refuses to accept the updated Claimant Commitment they will be given a ‘cooling off’ period of five working days. If either the Participant or partner refuses to accept the Claimant Commitment, their claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> will be closed.</p>

<p>125.	Jobcentre Plus will notify you if the Participant (or partner) refuses to accept the updated Claimant Commitment by completing and sending a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>126.	If a Participant and/or partner refuse to accept an updated Claimant Commitment, they will still be attached to the programme on a voluntary basis. You will be notified of any further change in circumstances, such as reclaiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and accepting the Claimant Commitment, so you can re-engage with the Participant.</p>

<h2>Easements for victims of domestic violence</h2>

<p>127.	<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> or <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> WRAG Participants subject to conditionality can have an easement when they have been a victim of actual or threatened domestic violence.</p>

<p>128.	<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participants will be excused from meeting the labour market conditions: availability, actively seeking employment, requiring a Claimant Commitment (unless they already have one) in certain circumstances, if they tell Jobcentre Plus they have been subject to domestic violence in the previous 26 weeks.</p>

<p>129.	A Participant can also be excused from attending Worksearch Reviews during any agreed easement period.</p>

<p>130.	There are two elements to the new easement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an initial four week period starting on the day the person notifies Jobcentre Plus that they have been threatened with or subject to actual domestic violence</li>
  <li>the facility to extend the initial easement to 13 weeks upon production to Jobcentre Plus of written evidence by the Participant during the initial four-week period. If the evidence is produced, the 13 week period will begin on the same date as the four-week period.</li>
</ul>

<p>131.	The purpose of the easement is to give the Participant time to resolve any immediate issues arising from the domestic violence, such as finding new accommodation, changing children’s schools or getting legal advice etc.</p>

<p>132.	Anyone making a new claim or already receiving benefit who tells Jobcentre Plus that they have been a victim of actual or threatened domestic violence is eligible for the initial four-week easement as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the incident of domestic violence occurred within the previous 26 weeks</li>
  <li>it meets the definition of domestic violence</li>
  <li>they are not living at the same address as the abuser</li>
  <li>they have not previously had a period of domestic violence easement within the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>133.	A Participant stating that they are a victim of domestic violence will not be referred to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> until either the end of their 13-week easement period or after the end of the initial four-week notification period if they fail to provide supporting evidence within that period.</p>

<p>134.	If you identify that Participants already on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> may be victims of domestic violence, you should advise the Participant to contact their Jobcentre Plus office straightaway.</p>

<p>135.	Jobcentre Plus will consider the Participant’s eligibility and notify you in writing if the domestic violence easement applies using the CEPD1 change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>136.	The Change of Circumstances form will state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the easement is for four or 13 weeks as appropriate</li>
  <li>start date of the easement</li>
  <li>anticipated end date of the easement</li>
  <li>reason for ending (that is, the easement reached full term, no evidence provided by the end of the fourth week, Participant no longer wishes to avail themselves of the easement,</li>
  <li>the revised date, if the easement ended before the anticipated date.</li>
</ul>

<p>137.	A Participant does not have to use all of their 13-week easement in one go. If, before the end of the period, they feel that they are able to meet the benefit conditionality requirements, they can ‘bank’ any remaining weeks and apply to use them again provided that they are used up within 12 months of their first notification to Jobcentre Plus that they have been a victim of domestic violence.</p>

<h2>Easement for Homeless Persons</h2>

<p>138.	An easement has been introduced to help support homeless persons in finding sustainable living accommodation which will help to remove a barrier into employment.</p>

<p>139.	The Regulations allow Jobcentre Plus to treat certain homeless Participants as meeting the Jobseeker conditions for periods of time with no limit on the number of occasions on which it can be applied.</p>

<p>140.	This will mean that for the period of the easement the Participant will not be required to participate in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>141.	This is conditionality easement is dependent upon the Participant taking reasonable action to find living accommodation.</p>

<p>142.	Participants who are suffering a domestic emergency as a result of recently becoming homeless can benefit from the easement. It is likely to be most suitable for the specific groups of homeless individuals mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rough sleepers</li>
  <li>those staying in direct hostels (that is, hostels designed to include short-stay residency options specifically for the homeless).</li>
</ul>

<p>143.	If an easement is applied, Jobcentre Plus will advise you of this by issuing you with a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>144.	The change of circumstances form will explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the Participant is currently unable to attend/take part in the provision</li>
  <li>the reason</li>
  <li>date of commencement of the easement</li>
  <li>that you will be notified when the circumstances change.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Duration and Frequency of the Easement</h3>

<p>145.	Regulations do not specify a duration for which an easement can be applied for a homeless Participant, nor set a limit on the number of occasions on which it can be applied.</p>

<p>146.	It will be for Jobcentre Plus to decide whether a Participant’s homelessness constitutes a “domestic emergency” and the length of time for which the easement is to be applied.</p>

<p>147.	It is not expected that a domestic emergency due to homelessness would last for more than four weeks, although Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches can extend the duration of the easement beyond four weeks if they decide that it is appropriate.</p>

<p>148.	Jobcentre Plus will undertake a review with the Participant on a regular basis, at least fortnightly, to ensure that the continuation of the easement is still appropriate and that the Participant is taking the required actions to find sustainable accommodation.</p>

<p>149.	Once the easement has been lifted you will be notified that the Participant can now attend/participate on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and the date from which the easement has been lifted.</p>

<p>150.	Where an easement period applies, participation on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will be suspended for the duration of the easement. During this time, no contact with the Participant should be made and no sanction doubt should be raised if they fail to undertake a mandated activity, unless completion was expected before the easement was awarded.</p>

<p>151.	When the easement period has finished, Jobcentre Plus will notify you using another change of circumstances form. You can then resume engagement with the Participant.</p>

<p>152.	A Participant for whom an easement applies will not have their time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> extended. It will remain at 456 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and 182 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Easement for Participants who are members of the Territorial Army or Reserves Forces (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>153.	A member of the Reserve Forces (including the Territorial Army) is treated as being available for work when engaged in annual continuous training for a maximum of 15 days per calendar year. Such persons are also treated as actively seeking employment for any period during any week in which they are engaged in annual continuous training for at least three days, up to a maximum of 15 days per calendar year.</p>

<p>154.	The regulation states Territorial Army members or reserve forces can be deemed as available to attend training. The Territorial Army or Reserve Forces are:</p>

<p>156.	Where a Participant report that they are due to attend their annual training camp, you should advise them that they are required to report it as a change of circumstances to their local Jobcentre Plus office, before they attend the camp.</p>

<p>157.	The Jobcentre will confirm the Participant’s attendance on the training course by sending you a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>158.	On receipt of the change of circumstances form stating that the Participant is taking part in annual continuous training, participation in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will be suspended for the duration of the training period and no contact should be made with the Participant.</p>

<p>159.	You can resume engagement with the Participant once the end date of the annual training period has passed.</p>

<p>160.	A Participant for whom this easement applies will not have their time on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core extended it will remain as 456 days.</p>

<p>161.	A Participant for whom this easement applies will not have their time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> extended it will remain as 182 days.</p>

<h2>Extended periods of sickness (<abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>) – <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participants only (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>162.	A <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participant can have two periods of sickness of up to 14 days within a job seeking period. If they suffer a third or a longer period of sickness, they can volunteer to stay on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> for up to 13 weeks in a rolling 12 month period on an <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>163.	The <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> is one continuous period of 13 weeks or less and cannot be split into separate periods. The 12 month rolling period is calculated from the first date of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>164.	If the Participant volunteers to continue on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> during the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>, they are able to stay close to the labour market with personalised conditionality and support tailored to their illness or health condition.</p>

<p>165.	The <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> period may be covered by form JSA28 for up to 14 days. From day 15 or day eight, if the period of sickness was expected to last longer than two weeks, the Participant must provide supporting medical evidence, for example, a fit note or Statement of Fitness or Work (<abbr title="Statement of Fitness or Work">SoFFW</abbr>).</p>

<p>166.	If supporting medical evidence is not provided the Participant will be expected to be available for and actively seeking work to stay on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>. Supporting medical evidence will be retained by the Jobcentre and the detail relating to a Participant’s conditionality will be recorded and notified to you on a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>167.	Once the Participant decides to remain on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will interview them to agree their temporary conditionality. It may be that the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach allows them to be treated as actively seeking work, for a short period of time at the beginning of the period, but they will be expected to increase their activity as they recover.</p>

<h3>Health condition likely to last longer than 13 weeks (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>168.	At the point the health condition or illness looks likely to last more than 13 weeks the Participant will be advised to claim <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> by the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach.</p>

<p>169.	Where this is the case the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will advise you by issuing a change of circumstances form. You should take the usual action to engage with the Participant on a change in their conditionality. If the Participant claims <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> they become a voluntary Participant so any subsequent Failure to Attend would not result in a sanctions referral.</p>

<h3>Participant no longer sick (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>170.

<p>A.01. When a Participant who is claiming Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>), and is in the All Work Related Requirements group (Intensive Work Search regime), reports to Jobcentre Plus that they are self-employed they will be required to attend a Gateway Interview with a Jobcentre Plus Work Coach to decide whether they are gainfully self-employed.</p>

<p>A.02. The Participant will be required to bring a completed Self-Employed Declaration and as much evidence as possible of their self-employed business.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their unique tax reference</li>
  <li>list of customers, suppliers, invoices and receipts</li>
  <li>previous tax returns</li>
  <li>previous declarations of income for tax credits</li>
  <li>business account bank details and statements</li>

  <li>name, address and telephone number of their accountant</li>
  <li>a diary of appointments, business meetings,</li>
  <li>business plans and or marketing material.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive and the Participant does not need to provide all of them.</p>

<h3>Gainfully Self-employed</h3>

<p>A.03. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes, to be gainfully self-employed the following criteria must be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>activity is carried out on a self-employed rather than an employed basis</li>
  <li>self-employment is the Participant’s main employment</li>
  <li>self-employment is regular, organised, developed and carried out in 
expectation of profit.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.04. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will consider a person is probably self-employed if they meet some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>run their own business and take responsibility for its success or failure</li>
  <li>usually have several customers at the same time</li>
  <li>decide how, when and where they do their work</li>
  <li>can hire, at their expense, people to do the work for them or help them do it</li>
  <li>provide the main items of equipment needed to do their work</li>
  <li>whether the activity is undertaken for financial gain</li>
  <li>the number of hours spent each week on the work</li>
  <li>any business plan or steps taken to increase income from the activity</li>
  <li>how HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regard the activity</li>
  <li>how much work is in the pipeline</li>
  <li>whether the Participant is actively marketing or advertising for work.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.05. If the Participant’s earnings are derived from employment under a contract of service, or in an office or other ‘casual’ paid work they are not self-employed.</p>

<p>A.06. At the end of the Gateway Interview, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will issue a decision letter to the Participant.</p>

<h3>Start-Up Period</h3>

<p>A.07. To support them while they grow their business, Participants who have been assessed as Gainfully Self-Employed may get a Start-Up Period during which they can continue to claim <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> without any requirement to look for alternative work. A Start-Up Period will be available to self-employed Participants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are gainfully self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>haven’t been undertaking the self-employed activity for more than 12 months before the start of the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment period in which the Gateway Interview takes place</li>
  <li>haven’t had a start-up period in the last five years</li>
  <li>are taking appropriate steps to increase their earnings with the aim of ultimately increasing earnings to the level of their conditionality earnings threshold.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.08. The Start-Up Period runs from the beginning of the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment period in which the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach agrees the Start-Up Period is applicable and ends after one year unless the Participant fails to continue to satisfy the criteria.</p>

<p>A.09. During the start-up period the Participant must attend quarterly interviews with a Jobcentre Plus Work Coach in order to meet their conditionality requirements. At the interviews the Participant must show that they remain gainfully self-employed and that they have been taking steps to increase their earnings, with the ultimate aim of increasing earnings to the level of their individual conditionality earnings threshold.</p>

<p>A.10. The Participant will indicate the steps they plan to take at the Gateway Interview and subsequent quarterly interviews, and if the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach agrees they are appropriate they will be set out in their Claimant Commitment.</p>

<h3>Minimum Income Floor</h3>

<p>A.11. The Minimum Income Floor (<abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>) is applied to Participants who are assessed as Gainfully Self Employed and would otherwise fall in the Intensive Work Search regime, where the Start-Up Period is not applicable.</p>

<p>A.12. The <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> is an assumed level of net earnings for a self-employed Participant that matches the work expectations of any other Participant with similar circumstances. The <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> is a monthly amount calculated on the basis of working up to a maximum of 35 hours per week and multiplied by the National Minimum Wage for their age group minus tax and National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>A.13. If the Participant’s actual earnings are below the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>, their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award will be calculated using the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>. If declared earnings exceed the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>, actual earnings will be used to calculate the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award. Participants who have the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> applied are placed in the Working Enough regime.</p>
