<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Change of Circumstances <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core (Disengagement/Re-engagement)</h2>

<p>1.	There are two occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on the core Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>). These are when a voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit has disengaged with you or when a Participant has re-engaged with you following a period of disengagement. This only applies to voluntary Participants in receipt of benefit - and there is no requirement to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of disengagement/re-engagement for a mandatory Participant or a voluntary Participant who is not in receipt of benefit.</p>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant disengages with you, as per the criteria stated in your tender using the change of circumstances notification form (WHP07) sent via unencrypted email.</li>
  <li>Where a change in Participant circumstances has resulted in disengagement it is important that you identify any complex needs and/or additional support that they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity.</li>
  <li>Continue to attempt to make contact and re-engage with the Participant pending the return of the CEPD1/UC78e from Jobcentre Plus as agreed in your tender for the duration of the programme (this could be up to 456 calendar days <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) unless you have been informed that a voluntary Participant does not want any further contact.</li>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant re-engages on the WHP07 notification form sent by unencrypted email.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Change of Circumstances <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> (Disengagement/Re-engagement)</h2>

<p>2.	There are three occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on the Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>). These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant after their start on the programme, has disengaged with you.</li>
  <li>after having started on the programme when a Participant has re-engaged with you, following a period of disengagement</li>
  <li>after a change in the Participant’s circumstance and through discussions with them, you jointly identify that alternative provision may better support the Participant. This must be in agreement with Jobcentre Plus.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, disengagement <strong>after starting</strong> on the programme is defined as a Participant failing to attend appointments, or complete activities (as agreed with the provider) and the provider has tried to re-engage with them at least three times within 10 working days from the date of the missed appointment. The first attempt being within two working days, or within any alternative contact arrangement period that they have agreed with the Participant.</p>

<p><strong>For example,</strong> if the agreed alternative contact agreement was for contact every 20 days, the attempts at contact before considering disengagement action would be three attempts at re-engagement within the 20 days.</p>

<p>4.	Where an individual is mandated to attend and participate in the first appointment and fails to attend prior to starting on the programme you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3b">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 3b Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start for further details</a>.</p>

<h2>Disengagement Process after starting on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Notify Jobcentre Plus when the Participant disengages with you as defined on paragraphs 2 and 3 above using the change of circumstances notification form (WHP07) sent via unencrypted email.</li>
  <li>If a Participant fails to attend an appointment or undertake agreed activities with you after they have attended the initial appointment /first appointment and started on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, you must attempt to contact the Participant on 3 separate occasions within 10 working days (or alternative contact timescale if agreed). The first attempt being within two working days.</li>
  <li>You must update your records for each attempt. If you fail to re-engage with the Participant within this timescale, you must notify Jobcentre Plus via a WHP07 of the Participants’ disengagement.</li>
  <li>Once you have notified Jobcentre Plus of the Participant disengagement do not enter an early completer code into Provider Referral and Payment System (PRaP). The referral will remain open for the duration of the 182 calendar days’ time on the programme to enable re-engagement if appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Further detail is provided on unencrypted email process in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#fb">detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Circumstances where a Participant disengages from the programme and you don’t need to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>
</h2>

<p>5.	When, after starting on the programme, a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Participant has informed you that they wish to disengage from the programme because they require no further support, you are not required to inform Jobcentre Plus of this.</p>

<p>6.	You should attempt to discuss and agree a contact arrangement with the Participant for the remainder of their time on the programme to enable them to access any additional support they may require. You must record the outcome of this discussion in the Participant’s records. Do not enter an early completer code into PRaP.</p>

<p>7.	The referral will remain open for the duration of the 182 calendar days’ time on the programme to enable re-engagement if appropriate.</p>

<h2>Participant has a change in circumstances that affects their engagement on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</h2>

<p>8.	Where a change in a Participant circumstance has resulted in disengagement it is important that you identify any complex needs and/or additional support that they may require. You should take any appropriate steps/action to support and encourage the Participants re engagement to enable them to continue their time on provision.</p>

<p>9.	Further information regarding complex needs can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter9">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Signposting to alternative provision for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>20.	 There may be an occasion where after a change in the Participant’s circumstances and through discussions with the Participant, you jointly identify that alternative provision is required. In the first instance you should discuss and where appropriate refer to other suitable support accessible, via your programme, before considering other alternatives.</p>

<p>21.	 If following this discussion, there is no suitable non <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision you should signpost the Participant to their work coach to discuss their options, including alternative suitable support as outlined in the bullets below.</p>

<h3>Actions for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You must discuss the Participant’s requirements with them considering their change in circumstances and the support you can offer them.</li>
  <li>You must discuss with the Participant any suitable support/non-contracted provision which may be appropriate to support them whilst they participate on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, e.g. bereavement or debt counselling.</li>
  <li>Where you jointly agree that an alternative suitable support/provision may be appropriate signpost the Participant back to their Work Coach to discuss.</li>
  <li>You must notify the Work Coach of this via the WHP07 (sent by unencrypted email) annotated with the words “alternative support discussion”.</li>
  <li>You must continue to support the Participant via <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> as outlined in your tender.</li>
  <li>On receipt of the WHP07, the Work Coach, if appropriate, will contact you to discuss whether a referral to an alternative <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contracted provision is appropriate.</li>
  <li>The Work Coach will contact the Participant to discuss and will update you of the outcome via the CEPD1/UC78e notification form.</li>
  <li>Upon receipt of the CEPD1/UC78e notification form, you must take the most appropriate action immediately to either continue to support the Participant via <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> or close the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> referral down by inputting completer reason ’46 exceptional circumstances’.</li>
  <li>Failure to close down the line immediately may impact <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> tracking and may result in a performance outcome not being achieved.</li>

<h2>Detailed background and further information</h2>

<h2>Provider notifies <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of Disengagement/Re-engagement</h2>

<h2>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core Programme</h2>

<h2>Disengaged Process – No contact with Voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit</h2>

<p>47.	Disengagement is when a Participant is no longer interacting with you for a continued period as agreed in your tender; this may also be part of your agreed delivery model. The process applies only after a Participant has started on the programme. The purpose of this process is to assist you to re-engage with a Participant who you have been unable to contact by triggering an interaction with Jobcentre Plus to establish why they have disengaged.</p>

<p>48.	You should notify Jobcentre Plus immediately when a voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit has met your disengagement criteria as set out in your tender and you have not been able to make contact. You should complete a WHP07 form and send by unencrypted email, advising of the last date the Participant engaged with you.</p>

<p>49.	The disengagement process should be followed if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attempted to re-engage with the Participant in line with your tender and not been able to make contact</li>
  <li>not received any notification from Jobcentre Plus to inform you of a change of circumstances on a CEPD1 or UC78e.</li>
</ul>

<p>50.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the first day you deem a voluntary Participant to have disengaged from the programme and send one WHP07 per Participant by unencrypted email.</p>

<p>51.	When notifying Jobcentre Plus of disengagement the WHP07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Work Coach. The email subject field must contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participant Disengagement or Engagement</li>
  <li>Participants surname</li>
  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>52.	If a Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) Participant has disengaged with you, your Nominated Officer should complete the change of circumstances form, ensure that it is marked clearly that the claimant is a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participant and send it to the Nominated Officer in the relevant Jobcentre Plus office by a secure postal service. Further information may be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 2 - Delivering Provision.</p>

<p>53.	A Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will contact the Participant to discuss participation in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you of the outcome of this interview on a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>54.	In cases where a change of circumstances may have contributed to the Participants disengagement it is important that you refer to  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 –Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a> and identify any complex needs and/or additional support they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity.</p>

<h2>Disengaged Process – Contact with Voluntary Participant in receipt of benefit (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>55.	A WHP07 is still required to be completed even though there is contact with the Participant and the Participant has asked you not to contact them.</p>

<p>56.	Where a Participant has asked you not to contact them. The Participants request should be adhered to and their file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file. In this scenario you should complete a WHP07 to inform Jobcentre Plus that the Participant has disengaged and wants no further contact.</p>

<h3>Actions to take when a WHP07 has been sent (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h3>

<p>57.	Where you have sent the WHP07 to the Jobcentre to instigate contact with a Work Coach you have a responsibility to endeavour to contact and re-engage with the Participant as agreed in your tender for the duration of the programme (this could be up to 456 calendar days). This does not apply where a voluntary Participant has already advised that they do not want any further contact.</p>

<p>58.	Therefore, if you have still had no contact from the Participant, and not received a CEPD1/UC78e from Jobcentre Plus, then you must attempt to re-engage as per the re-engagement process in your tender.</p>

<p>59.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file.</p>

<p>60.	If the Participant decides to re-engage at any point during the remainder of the 456 calendar days Jobcentre Plus will signpost the Participant back to you for the balance of time. If the Participant has notified you directly then you will complete a WHP07 to advise that Jobcentre Plus that they have re-engaged.</p>

<h2>Circumstances that are not considered disengagement - WHP07 not required (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>61.	The disengagement process should not be followed and a WHP07 is not required to be completed in the following circumstances as there is contact with the Participant when you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make arrangements to tailor the level of engagement with a Participant who you are in contact with due to a change in circumstances, for example a Participant may have an operation and require two-weeks recovery</li>
  <li>receive a CEPD1/UC78e change of circumstances notification from Jobcentre Plus where you may be asked to suspend or reduce engagement due to an easement (usually for a finite period of time).</li>
</ul>

<p>62.	As per bullet one above, it is possible that a Participants participation will be affected by a change of circumstances or period of ill health. In these circumstances it may be appropriate to tailor engagement. Further information is held in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 –Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a>, provides details around complex needs and additional support - tailoring the level of engagement with a Participant forms part of this.</p>

<h2>Re-engagement – Completion of WHP07 for Voluntary Participants in receipt of benefit (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>63.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the WHP07 change of circumstances notification form and send by unencrypted email when the Participant re-engages with you.</p>

<p>64.	When notifying Jobcentre Plus of re-engagement the WHP07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Work Coach. The email subject field must contain the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participant Engagement</li>
  <li>Participants surname</li>
  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>One notification form per email.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Voluntary Participant not in receipt of benefit stops engaging with you (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>65.	If a non-benefit claiming Participant disengages, you do not need to report this change to Jobcentre Plus. You have a responsibility to endeavour to make contact and re-engage with the Participant throughout this period as agreed in your tender.</p>

<p>66.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why if a reason is provided. If the Participant states that they do not want to participate anymore this is a sufficient reason to note on the file.</p>

<p>67.	Where a change of circumstances may have contributed to the Participants disengagement it is important that you refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 Working with Participants with complex needs and /or additional support requirements</a> and identify any complex needs and/or additional support they may require before undertaking re-engagement activity and agree the appropriate level of interaction.</p>

<p>68.	A non-benefit Participant referral will be identified on PRaP and it is your responsibility to maintain accurate records to ensure this information is up to date.</p>

<h2>Participant receiving In-Work-Support (<abbr title="In-Work-Support">IWS</abbr>) during extension period – WHP07 not required (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>69.	A Participant is on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core for up to 456 calendar days with a possibility of it extending to a maximum of 639 calendar days where they require <abbr title="In-Work-Support">IWS</abbr>.</p>

<p>70.	Where a Participant is receiving <abbr title="In-Work-Support">IWS</abbr> and you have been unable to contact them a WHP07 should not be sent to Jobcentre Plus to notify of disengagement. In these circumstances you must still try and contact the Participant.</p>

<p>71.	If the Participant contacts you and specifically requests that you do not contact them, their wishes should be adhered to and the file noted with the reasons why, if a reason is provided.</p>

<p>136.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify the outcome of the interview on a UC78e change of circumstances form. If the Participant is gainfully self-employed and a start-up period is appropriate, they should also include the start and end dates.</p>

<p>137.	If the Participant is treated as being gainfully self-employed, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will book a subsequent self-employed quarterly interview to take place at three, six and nine month stages. At the end of each quarterly interview (or at any other time when a change is reported), the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you if the Participant: any other time when a change is reported), the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you if the Participant:</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participant / partner refuses to accept Claimant Commitment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>140.	As part of entitlement to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> the Participant will have a Claimant Commitment specifying the work related requirements they must complete. In the case of a couple, each will have their own Claimant Commitment. Jobcentre Plus is responsible for reviewing and updating the Participant’s Claimant Commitment to reflect any changes to the claim or their conditionality.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants must accept their Claimant Commitment but there is no requirement for them to sign it.</p>

<p>141.	If the Participant or, in the case of a household/joint claim, their partner refuses to accept the updated Claimant Commitment they will be given a ‘cooling off’ period of five working days. If either the Participant or partner refuses to accept the Claimant Commitment, their claim to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> will be closed.</p>

<p>142.	Jobcentre Plus will notify you if the Participant (or partner) refuses to accept the updated Claimant Commitment by completing and sending a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>143.	If a Participant and/or partner refuse to accept an updated Claimant Commitment, they will still be attached to the programme on a voluntary basis. You will be notified of any further change in circumstances, such as reclaiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and accepting the Claimant Commitment, so you can re-engage with the Participant.</p>

<h2>Switching off Work-Related Requirements and Tailored Conditionality for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants (not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>144.	There may be times when Jobcentre Plus identifies a change in the Participant’s particular circumstances that means their work search and work availability requirements detailed on the Claimant Commitment should be temporarily switched off for a limited period of time. Conditionality can also be tailored to limit work-related requirements.</p>

<p>145.	Jobcentre Plus will confirm if work related requirements must be switched off or limited to meet the Participant’s new circumstances by sending the UC78e by unencrypted email. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach (WC) will set new requirements on the Claimant Commitment and record the start and end date or review date (if applicable).</p>

<p>146.	When work related requirements are switched off, the Participant will stay in their original labour market regime. The aim is to avoid movement between regimes and allow <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to easily reapply full conditionality when the circumstances return to normal.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Although work search and work availability requirements may be switched off, work preparation activities may continue to apply so you could continue to engage with the Participant.</p>

<h2>Switching off requirements for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants</h2>

<p>147.	<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Regulations specify the particular circumstances when work search and availability requirements must be switched off. Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches have the discretion to switch off/tailor other work-related requirements, as appropriate. This applies to Participants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>with a self-certificate/medical evidence of illness of up to 14 days (see section ‘Participant is sick’)</li>
  <li>receiving or accompanying a child or qualifying young person or partner, for whom they are responsible, for medical treatment, convalescence or care outside of Great Britain (for up to 6 months)</li>
  <li>bereaved following the death of their partner or their child or a child or qualifying young person, for whom they are responsible, within the past six months</li>
  <li>receiving and has been participating for no more than six months in a structured recovery orientated course for drug and/or alcohol dependency</li>
  <li>in prison (detained in custody pending trial or sentence or on temporary release and they remain entitled to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>attending court or a tribunal as a witness</li>
  <li>on the witness protection programme for up to three months</li>
  <li>engaged in a public duty (for example jury service, volunteer fire-fighter; lifeboat server, coastguard, councillor or Territorial Army reservist)</li>
  <li>who have recently been a victim of domestic violence or abuse</li>
  <li>supporting a child who needs additional care due to the effect of bereavement, violence or abuse (including domestic violence or abuse).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Under <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Regulations, Participants who are victims of domestic violence and abuse could have all work-related requirements switched off for a limited period.</p>

<p>148.	Where you consider that work related activity should be switched off (for example, if you become aware of a change of circumstances covered in the list above), you must refer the Participant immediately to Jobcentre Plus for an assessment of their current circumstances.</p>

<p>149.	Where Jobcentre Plus report that All Work-Related activity must be temporarily switched off, you will need to suspend engagement with the Participant for the set period of time.</p>

<p>150.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you of the date when work related activity has been switched off on the change of circumstances form. You will need to suspend engagement with the Participant from the start date of the easement.</p>

<p>151.	The easement period will count towards the Participant’s allotted time on Work and Health Programme. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will ensure that appropriate dates are set to review when the requirements can be switched back on. When the temporary period has ended, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you about the re-instatement of work-related requirements on a UC78e change of circumstances form so that you can re-engage with the Participant.</p>

<p>152.	For Participants that need structured treatment for drug and/or alcohol dependency, the Participant will be referred formally via Jobcentre Plus to the treatment provider. Jobcentre Plus will undertake a monthly check to monitor that they remain in treatment with the approved provider for up to 182 calendar days.</p>

<h2>Tailored Conditionality for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants</h2>

<p>153.	Conditionality can also be tailored, particularly when the Participant has a temporary emergency or temporary responsibility. Therefore, Work Coaches have the discretion to switch off work search/work availability requirements where it would be unreasonable for these to be imposed on a Participant. Examples of this include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>temporary childcare responsibilities for example where there is no appropriate childcare available during the school holidays and no other arrangements can be made or where the child is temporarily excluded from school</li>
  <li>dealing with a domestic emergency</li>
  <li>having to make funeral arrangements</li>
  <li>sickness that exceeds the first 14 days of sickness</li>
  <li>undergoing any other temporary circumstance and it would be unreasonable to expect them to work search/be available for work.</li>
</ul>

<p>154.	Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches may decide that the Participant should be subject to other work-related requirements. This may include work preparation requirements and/or work focused interview requirements, or limiting work search or work availability requirements. They will notify you of the nature of any limitations and expectations on Participants.</p>

<p>155.	At all times, Jobcentre Plus needs to ensure that the requirements imposed on Participants are reasonable given their capability and circumstance. Therefore, Jobcentre Plus has the discretion to limit work-related requirements. Jobcentre Plus will determine the limitations that need to be agreed with the Participant.</p>

<p>156.	This can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the time the Participant is expected to look for work</li>
  <li>reducing the time they are expected to travel to work</li>
  <li>reducing the hours or days they are available for work</li>
  <li>limiting the type of work the Participant is expected to look for work.</li>
</ul>

<p>157.	Once the limitations have been determined the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will create a new Claimant Commitment and notify you on the change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>158.	Once the easement period has finished, Jobcentre Plus will notify you using another UC78e change of circumstances form, with updated requirements.</p>

<h2>Work Availability Requirements for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Participants</h2>

<p>159.	Participants in the Intensive Work Search regime must be available and willing to start work and attend a job interview immediately. In certain circumstances, as detailed below, Participants may be given more time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participants who need to arrange childcare (or other care arrangements) before taking up work or attending an interview will be given up to 48 hours to attend an interview and a period of one month to take up a job.</li>
  <li>Participants who are volunteers will be given up to 48 hours to attend an interview and one week to take up work.</li>
  <li>Participants with a contract of employment will be given 48 hours to attend an interview and will not be required to be available until they have served their notice period.</li>
  <li>Participants who have a fit note from a doctor will not be required to take up a new job until their fit note expires.</li>
  <li>Participants who have recently left prison will not be required to take up work within the first seven days of release.</li>
</ul>

<p>160.	In addition, work search and availability requirements must be limited to a work location which would take Participants a maximum of 90 minutes to and from home in each direction.</p>

<h2>Easements for victims of domestic violence</h2>

<p>161.	<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> or <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> WRAG Participants subject to conditionality can have an easement when they have been a victim of actual or threatened domestic violence.</p>

<p>162.	<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participants will be excused from meeting the labour market conditions: availability, actively seeking employment, requiring a Claimant Commitment (unless they already have one) in certain circumstances, if they tell Jobcentre Plus they have been subject to domestic violence in the previous 26 weeks.</p>

<p>163.	A Participant can also be excused from attending Worksearch Reviews during any agreed easement period.</p>

<p>164.	There are two elements to the new easement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an initial four week period starting on the day the person notifies Jobcentre Plus that they have been threatened with or subject to actual domestic violence</li>
  <li>the facility to extend the initial easement to 13 weeks upon production to Jobcentre Plus of written evidence by the Participant during the initial four-week period. If the evidence is produced, the 13 week period will begin on the same date as the four-week period.</li>
</ul>

<p>165.	The purpose of the easement is to give the Participant time to resolve any immediate issues arising from the domestic violence, such as finding new accommodation, changing children’s schools or getting legal advice etc.</p>

<p>166.	Anyone making a new claim or already receiving benefit who tells Jobcentre Plus that they have been a victim of actual or threatened domestic violence is eligible for the initial four-week easement as long as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the incident of domestic violence occurred within the previous 26 weeks</li>
  <li>it meets the definition of domestic violence</li>
  <li>they are not living at the same address as the abuser</li>
  <li>they have not previously had a period of domestic violence easement within the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>167.	A Participant stating that they are a victim of domestic violence will not be referred to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> until either the end of their 13-week easement period or after the end of the initial four-week notification period if they fail to provide supporting evidence within that period.</p>

<p>168.	If you identify that Participants already on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> may be victims of domestic violence, you should advise the Participant to contact their Jobcentre Plus office straightaway.</p>

<p>169.	Jobcentre Plus will consider the Participant’s eligibility and notify you in writing if the domestic violence easement applies using the CEPD1 change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>170.	The Change of Circumstances form will state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the easement is for four or 13 weeks as appropriate</li>
  <li>start date of the easement</li>
  <li>anticipated end date of the easement</li>
  <li>reason for ending (that is, the easement reached full term, no evidence provided by the end of the fourth week, Participant no longer wishes to avail themselves of the easement,</li>
  <li>the revised date, if the easement ended before the anticipated date.</li>
</ul>

<p>171.	A Participant does not have to use all of their 13-week easement in one go. If, before the end of the period, they feel that they are able to meet the benefit conditionality requirements, they can ‘bank’ any remaining weeks and apply to use them again provided that they are used up within 12 months of their first notification to Jobcentre Plus that they have been a victim of domestic violence.</p>

<h2>Easement for Homeless Persons</h2>

<p>172.	An easement has been introduced to help support homeless persons in finding sustainable living accommodation which will help to remove a barrier into employment.</p>

<p>173.	The Regulations allow Jobcentre Plus to treat certain homeless Participants as meeting the Jobseeker conditions for periods of time with no limit on the number of occasions on which it can be applied.</p>

<p>174.	This will mean that for the period of the easement the Participant will not be required to participate in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>175.	This is conditionality easement is dependent upon the Participant taking reasonable action to find living accommodation.</p>

<p>176.	Participants who are suffering a domestic emergency as a result of recently becoming homeless can benefit from the easement. It is likely to be most suitable for the specific groups of homeless individuals mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rough sleepers</li>
  <li>those staying in direct hostels (that is, hostels designed to include short-stay residency options specifically for the homeless).</li>
</ul>

<p>177.	If an easement is applied, Jobcentre Plus will advise you of this by issuing you with a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>178.	The change of circumstances form will explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the Participant is currently unable to attend/take part in the provision</li>
  <li>the reason</li>
  <li>date of commencement of the easement</li>
  <li>that you will be notified when the circumstances change.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Duration and Frequency of the Easement</h3>

<p>179.	Regulations do not specify a duration for which an easement can be applied for a homeless Participant, nor set a limit on the number of occasions on which it can be applied.</p>

<p>180.	It will be for Jobcentre Plus to decide whether a Participant’s homelessness constitutes a “domestic emergency” and the length of time for which the easement is to be applied.</p>

<p>181.	It is not expected that a domestic emergency due to homelessness would last for more than four weeks, although Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches can extend the duration of the easement beyond four weeks if they decide that it is appropriate.</p>

<p>182.	Jobcentre Plus will undertake a review with the Participant on a regular basis, at least fortnightly, to ensure that the continuation of the easement is still appropriate and that the Participant is taking the required actions to find sustainable accommodation.</p>

<p>183.	Once the easement has been lifted you will be notified that the Participant can now attend/participate on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and the date from which the easement has been lifted.</p>

<p>184.	Where an easement period applies, participation on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will be suspended for the duration of the easement. During this time, no contact with the Participant should be made and no sanction doubt should be raised if they fail to undertake a mandated activity, unless completion was expected before the easement was awarded.</p>

<p>185.	When the easement period has finished, Jobcentre Plus will notify you using another change of circumstances form. You can then resume engagement with the Participant.</p>

<p>186.	A Participant for whom an easement applies will not have their time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> extended. It will remain at 456 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and 182 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Easement for Participants who are members of the Territorial Army or Reserves Forces (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>187.	A member of the Reserve Forces (including the Territorial Army) is treated as being available for work when engaged in annual continuous training for a maximum of 15 days per calendar year. Such persons are also treated as actively seeking employment for any period during any week in which they are engaged in annual continuous training for at least three days, up to a maximum of 15 days per calendar year.</p>

<p>188.	The regulation states Territorial Army members or reserve forces can be deemed as available to attend training. The Territorial Army or Reserve Forces are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Royal Fleet Reserve</li>
  <li>Royal Naval Reserve</li>
  <li>Royal Marines Reserve</li>
  <li>Army Reserve</li>
  <li>Territorial Army</li>
  <li>Royal Air Force Reserve</li>
  <li>Royal Auxiliary Air Force</li>
  <li>Royal Irish Regiment.</li>
</ul>

<p>189.	A Participant who is a member of the Territorial Army or Reserve Forces will be excused attendance from the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> for a maximum of 15 days in any calendar year, where they are attending their annual training camp.</p>

<p>190.	Where a Participant report that they are due to attend their annual training camp, you should advise them that they are required to report it as a change of circumstances to their local Jobcentre Plus office, before they attend the camp.</p>

<p>191.	The Jobcentre will confirm the Participant’s attendance on the training course by sending you a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>192.	On receipt of the change of circumstances form stating that the Participant is taking part in annual continuous training, participation in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will be suspended for the duration of the training period and no contact should be made with the Participant.</p>

<p>193.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core no sanction doubt should be raised if the Participant fails to undertake a mandated activity, unless completion of that activity was expected before the annual training period commenced.</p>

<p>194.	You can resume engagement with the Participant once the end date of the annual training period has passed.</p>

<p>195.	A Participant for whom this easement applies will not have their time on the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core extended it will remain as 456 days.</p>

<p>196.	A Participant for whom this easement applies will not have their time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> extended it will remain as 182 days.</p>

<h2>Extended periods of sickness (<abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>) – <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participants only (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>197.	A <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participant can have two periods of sickness of up to 14 days within a job seeking period. If they suffer a third or a longer period of sickness, they can volunteer to stay on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> for up to 13 weeks in a rolling 12 month period on an <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>198.	The <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> is one continuous period of 13 weeks or less and cannot be split into separate periods. The 12 month rolling period is calculated from the first date of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>199.	If the Participant volunteers to continue on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> during the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>, they are able to stay close to the labour market with personalised conditionality and support tailored to their illness or health condition.</p>

<p>200.	The <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> period may be covered by form JSA28 for up to 14 days. From day 15 or day eight, if the period of sickness was expected to last longer than two weeks, the Participant must provide supporting medical evidence, for example, a fit note or Statement of Fitness or Work (<abbr title="Statement of Fitness or Work">SoFFW</abbr>).</p>

<p>201.	If supporting medical evidence is not provided the Participant will be expected to be available for and actively seeking work to stay on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>. Supporting medical evidence will be retained by the Jobcentre and the detail relating to a Participant’s conditionality will be recorded and notified to you on a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>202.	Once the Participant decides to remain on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will interview them to agree their temporary conditionality. It may be that the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach allows them to be treated as actively seeking work, for a short period of time at the beginning of the period, but they will be expected to increase their activity as they recover.</p>

<h2>Tailored Conditionality</h2>

<p>203.	If the Participant elects to remain on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> they will be treated as being available for work and capable for work for the whole duration of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</p>

<p>204.	However, the Participant can be required to look for work or undertake an activity designed to improve their job prospects or keep them in touch with the labour market.</p>

<p>205.	In deciding whether the Participant should undertake any activity, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Participant’s health condition</li>
  <li>what their Fit Note states</li>
  <li>likely duration of sickness</li>
  <li>their personal circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>206.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will then decide whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to remove the conditionality requirements completely for the whole duration of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>to remove conditionality requirements completely for part of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> and the Participant has limited conditionality for the remaining duration of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the Participant has limited conditionality for the whole duration of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> A Participant with a six week fit note may have no conditionality for the first two weeks however as they recover they may have four weeks limited conditionality.</p>

<p>207.	Tailored conditionality means replacing the conditionality requirements with a new set of temporary requirements which take into account the change in the Participant’s health condition and which are reasonable in light of their current personal circumstances.</p>

<p>208.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider when the Participant’s conditionality will be reviewed taking into account their health condition</li>
  <li>notify you on a CEPD1 Change of Circumstances form of any change in conditionality including:
    <ul>
      <li>if further supporting medical evidence is provided</li>
      <li>if the Participant decides to end their claim to <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>
</li>
      <li>if the Participant’s conditionality changes</li>
      <li>the date when <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> ends and when the Participant will be 	ready to continue with their normal Action Plan activities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditionality impact for Work and Health Programme Providers</h2>

<p>209.	Following the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach assessment of the Participant sickness, the Work Coach will decide to remove the Participant’s conditionality completely, that is no conditionality, or agree that the Participant has limited conditionality.</p>

<p>210.	The decision made by the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach on the Participant’s conditionality during the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> will have an effect on how you engage with the Participant.</p>

<p>211.	The temporary conditionality requirements which take into account the Participant’s health condition do not affect their original Claimant Commitment.</p>

<h3>No conditionality</h3>

<p>212.	If the Participant’s conditionality is removed you must not mandate the Participant to undertake any specified activities. However, you may continue to engage with the Participant during this period taking into account their circumstances.</p>

<h3>Limited conditionality</h3>

<p>213.	If the Participant has limited conditionality you may contact the Participant to discuss revisions to their action plan, and agree what reasonable activities you expect them to do for the time they are under limited conditionality.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> A Participant’s conditionality may change during the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you if the Participant’s conditionality changes during <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> on a change of circumstances form.</p>

<p>214.	When deciding whether activity is reasonable, activities set will need to be tailored to the health condition or illness and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain appropriate to the Participant as they recover or if their health deteriorates.</p>

<p>215.	Whilst the Participant has limited conditionality they can be supported towards employment for the whole duration of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>. The Participant must not be mandated to take up work however they can be mandated to apply for a job or complete activities that are steps towards preparing them for work.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If the period of <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> overlaps a period where you have previously mandated the Participant to undertake specified activities a new notification may have to be issued to mirror amendments to the Participant’s action plan if they have limited conditionality. Alternatively, if they have no conditionality the notification will have to be withdrawn taking into account the Participant’s circumstances.</p>

<h3>Notification to Work and Health Programme Provider</h3>

<p>216.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you on a CEPD1 change of circumstances form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that the Participant is on an <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the start and end dates of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>details of their conditionality (whether No conditionality or Limited conditionality)</li>
  <li>start and end dates of each conditionality period.</li>
</ul>

<p>217.	On receipt of the notification you should note your records of the dates of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> period and tailor your engagement with the Participant taking into consideration any conditionality notified by the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach.</p>

<p>218.	The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will issue further CEPD1 change of circumstances forms during the period they are on <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>219.	if further supporting medical evidence is provided</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the Participant decides to end their claim to <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>to notify you if the Participant’s conditionality changes</li>
  <li>to notify you of the date when <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> ends and when the Participant will be ready to continue with their normal action plan activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>220.	If you have not received another CEPD1 change of circumstances notification by the end date of the <abbr title="Extended Period of Sickness">EPS</abbr> you should contact the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach who will advise and issue change of circumstances form with the appropriate information.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If a Participant brings a Fit Note to you, you must not accept the Fit Note and you should refer the Participant to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<h3>Health condition likely to last longer than 13 weeks (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>221.	At the point the health condition or illness looks likely to last more than 13 weeks the Participant will be advised to claim <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> by the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach.</p>

<p>222.	Where this is the case the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will advise you by issuing a change of circumstances form. You should take the usual action to engage with the Participant on a change in their conditionality. If the Participant claims <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> they become a voluntary Participant so any subsequent Failure to Attend would not result in a sanctions referral.</p>

<h3>Participant no longer sick (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>223.	If the Participant does not supply a further Fit Note, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will notify you on a change of circumstances form that the Participant is no longer sick and has returned to their original conditionality. You may contact the Participant to discuss their on-going support.</p>

<h3>Notification of Participant change of circumstances via unencrypted email (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>224.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus on the first day you deem a voluntary Participant to have disengaged from the programme and send one WHP07 per Participant by unencrypted email.</p>

<p>226.	For individuals who have attended and participated in their first appointment and informed you that they do not wish to participate on the programme, you should input a Did Not Start (<abbr title="Did Not Start">DNS</abbr>) into PRaP by the 15th working day of receiving the referral. You should complete a WHP07 to notify the Work Coach that the participant attended and participated in the first appointment and refer the individual back to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>227.	When notifying Jobcentre Plus of attendance the WHP07 change of circumstances form must include details of the referring office and Work Coach.</p>

<h2>Circumstances when a Change of Circumstances Notification is required for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>230.	There are three occasions where you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of a change of circumstances whilst on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant after their start on the programme, has disengaged with you</li>
  <li>has re-engaged with you following a period of disengagement after having started on the programme</li>
  <li>after a change in the Participant’s circumstance and through discussions with the Participant, you jointly identify that alternative provision may better support the Participant. This must be in agreement with Jobcentre Plus.</li>
</ul>

<p>231.	You must notify Jobcentre Plus of these changes via the WHP07 form to notify the Work Coach.</p>

<p>232.	When notifying Jobcentre Plus of disengagement/re engagement or signposting to alternative provision you must complete the WHP07 change of circumstances form, you must include details of the referring office and Work Coach.</p>

<p>233.	On the WHP07 note the date the Participant either disengaged or re engaged and for those Participants who you are proposing to signpost to alternative provision note todays date and the words “alternative support discussion”</p>

  <li>last three digits of their National Insurance Number (<abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>).</li>
  <li>One notification form per unencrypted email.</li>
</ul>

<p>235.	It is the responsibility of the Participant to notify Jobcentre Plus of any change in their circumstances that occur whilst attending <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>. Where a Participant informs you of a change of circumstances, you are to direct them to report the change to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Some Participants in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> have a journal, in these cases ask them to update their journal to report the change in circumstances rather than direct them to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>236.	For Participants claiming <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> you will be notified of any changes that impact participation via unencrypted email using the CEPD1 form.</p>

<p>237.	For Participants claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> you will be notified of any changes that impact participation via unencrypted email using the UC78e form.</p>

<p>238.	On receipt of the notification of Participant change of circumstances: ensure that the Participant has been referred to you or your sub-contractors.</p>

<p>239.	If referred by email, check that only one change of circumstances form has been attached to the email.</p>

<p>240.	If you have received a change of circumstances form for an individual who has not been referred to you or your sub-contractors, or an email containing more than one claimant record, or an email sent to an address other than your designated inbox you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>241.	To mitigate the risk of data being lost, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Operational Security has restricted the number of client records that may be transmitted via the unencrypted email process to a maximum of one client record on a CEPD1/UC78e form per email. If more than one client record per email is sent via the unencrypted email process, this will constitute a security breach and must be reported to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as per current instructions (see Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8 Information Security).</p>

<p>242.

<p>A.01. When a Participant who is claiming Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>), and is in the All Work Related Requirements group (Intensive Work Search regime), reports to Jobcentre Plus that they are self-employed they will be required to attend a Gateway Interview with a Jobcentre Plus Work Coach to decide whether they are gainfully self-employed.</p>

<p>A.02. The Participant will be required to bring a completed Self-Employed Declaration and as much evidence as possible of their self-employed business.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their unique tax reference</li>
  <li>list of customers, suppliers, invoices and receipts</li>
  <li>previous tax returns</li>
  <li>previous declarations of income for tax credits</li>

  <li>name, address and telephone number of their accountant</li>
  <li>a diary of appointments, business meetings,</li>
  <li>business plans and or marketing material.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive and the Participant does not need to provide all of them.</p>

<h3>Gainfully Self-employed</h3>

<p>A.03. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes, to be gainfully self-employed the following criteria must be satisfied:</p>

<ul>
  <li>activity is carried out on a self-employed rather than an employed basis</li>
  <li>self-employment is the Participant’s main employment</li>
  <li>self-employment is regular, organised, developed and carried out in 
expectation of profit.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.04. The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will consider a person is probably self-employed if they meet some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>run their own business and take responsibility for its success or failure</li>
  <li>usually have several customers at the same time</li>
  <li>decide how, when and where they do their work</li>
  <li>can hire, at their expense, people to do the work for them or help them do it</li>
  <li>provide the main items of equipment needed to do their work</li>
  <li>whether the activity is undertaken for financial gain</li>
  <li>the number of hours spent each week on the work</li>
  <li>any business plan or steps taken to increase income from the activity</li>
  <li>how HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regard the activity</li>
  <li>how much work is in the pipeline</li>
  <li>whether the Participant is actively marketing or advertising for work.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.05. If the Participant’s earnings are derived from employment under a contract of service, or in an office or other ‘casual’ paid work they are not self-employed.</p>

<p>A.06. At the end of the Gateway Interview, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach will issue a decision letter to the Participant.</p>

<h3>Start-Up Period</h3>

<p>A.07. To support them while they grow their business, Participants who have been assessed as Gainfully Self-Employed may get a Start-Up Period during which they can continue to claim <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> without any requirement to look for alternative work. A Start-Up Period will be available to self-employed Participants who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are gainfully self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>haven’t been undertaking the self-employed activity for more than 12 months before the start of the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment period in which the Gateway Interview takes place</li>
  <li>haven’t had a start-up period in the last five years</li>
  <li>are taking appropriate steps to increase their earnings with the aim of ultimately increasing earnings to the level of their conditionality earnings threshold.</li>
</ul>

<p>A.08. The Start-Up Period runs from the beginning of the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> assessment period in which the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach agrees the Start-Up Period is applicable and ends after one year unless the Participant fails to continue to satisfy the criteria.</p>

<p>A.09. During the start-up period the Participant must attend quarterly interviews with a Jobcentre Plus Work Coach in order to meet their conditionality requirements. At the interviews the Participant must show that they remain gainfully self-employed and that they have been taking steps to increase their earnings, with the ultimate aim of increasing earnings to the level of their individual conditionality earnings threshold.</p>

<p>A.10. The Participant will indicate the steps they plan to take at the Gateway Interview and subsequent quarterly interviews, and if the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach agrees they are appropriate they will be set out in their Claimant Commitment.</p>

<h3>Minimum Income Floor</h3>

<p>A.11. The Minimum Income Floor (<abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>) is applied to Participants who are assessed as Gainfully Self Employed and would otherwise fall in the Intensive Work Search regime, where the Start-Up Period is not applicable.</p>

<p>A.12. The <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> is an assumed level of net earnings for a self-employed Participant that matches the work expectations of any other Participant with similar circumstances. The <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> is a monthly amount calculated on the basis of working up to a maximum of 35 hours per week and multiplied by the National Minimum Wage for their age group minus tax and National Insurance Contributions.</p>

<p>A.13. If the Participant’s actual earnings are below the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>, their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award will be calculated using the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>. If declared earnings exceed the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr>, actual earnings will be used to calculate the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award. Participants who have the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> applied are placed in the Working Enough regime.</p>
