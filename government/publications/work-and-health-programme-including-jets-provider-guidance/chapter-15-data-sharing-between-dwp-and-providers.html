<h2>Introduction (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.	The purpose of this chapter is to summarise all the elements of data that will be shared between the Department and you. The following paragraphs focus on the customer journey from referral stage through to when they finish the programme. We explain the type of data which will be shared and the sources of this, including the overarching processes in place.</p>

<p>2.	As a Provider you will have been required to submit a Security Plan at the procurement stage. Once assured by the Department this demonstrates your suitability to receive and store information as well as confirming that you comply with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security Policy (which includes compliance with such standards as ISO/IEC27001). See further information about our security procedures can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 8 – Information Security</a></p>

<h2>Data transfer at the start of the programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>3.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may send you personal and sensitive information about participants. This will include documents detailing disability status and barriers to work. This data must be securely stored and with procedures in place which allow it to be retrieved from your systems. Some or all the data may be forwarded to your sub-contractors.</p>

<p>5.	This information will be largely transferred to you via the Department’s Provider Referral and Payment System (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>). If it is not appropriate to use <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> this information will be shared by email. Further information is provided at paragraphs 10 and 11.</p>

<p>6.	<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> has a robust security accreditation level (IL2) in relation to data storage. This is reviewed annually or whenever there are any system updates/changes. In addition to this other <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to limit Provider access until they have met the Department’s security standards.</li>
  <li>Access Control – Audits are undertaken every 30 days to ensure the right people have access.</li>
  <li>Provider access via Government Gateway which is a secure internet gateway which has its own security standards (owned by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>7.	Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangement (<abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangement">MAPPA</abbr>) participants will be referred through <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chap3">Chapter 3 - Acknowledging Referrals, Initial Participant Engagement and Registering a Start</a>.</p>

<p>8.	Participants who have been granted Special Client Record (<abbr title="Special Client Record">SCR</abbr>) status will always be referred to you clerically using the SL2 clerical referral form.</p>

<h2>Data transfer during the programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>9.	When the Department becomes aware of any changes in Participant information, they will notify you via a change of circumstances notification form. Further information can be found in Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 10 – Change of Circumstances and Notifications.</p>

<p>10.	Where the Participant is also a benefit claimant, you must notify Jobcentre Plus using the Change of Circumstances notification form WHP07 if you are informed that:</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the Participant has disengaged with you (voluntary participants only)</li>
  <li>the Participant has re-engaged with you following a disengagement (voluntary participants only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> only</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When a Participant who has been mandated to attend and participate in the initial appointment with you and does not attend.</li>
  <li>After a change in the Participant’s circumstance and through discussions with the Participant, you jointly identify that alternative provision may better support the Participant</li>
</ul>

<p>11.	Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter10">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 10 – Change of Circumstances and Notifications</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3b">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 3b Acknowledging Referrals, Initial Participant Engagement and Registering a Start</a>.</p>

<p>12. There are also circumstances we expect you to notify the department about for mandated participants such as when they fail to engage with mandated activity or fail to attend. Please see – Work and Health Programme Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Chapter 3b – Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start for further details. For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core please see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work and Health Programme Chapter 3 – Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start</li>
  <li>Chapter 5a – Mandation to activity attracting a Low level sanction</li>
  <li>Chapter 5b – Mandation to activity attracting a Higher Level sanction; and</li>
  <li>Chapter 7 – Entitlement doubt, Chapter 8 – Raising a compliance doubt for <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participants and Chapter 9- Re-compliance and reviewing a compliance doubt</li>
</ul>

<p>13.	There is also a requirement for you to notify the Department when you employ a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Participant in your employment business. You must complete a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Employment Business Customer Form and provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customer name</li>
  <li><abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr></li>
  <li>date employment commenced.</li>
</ul>

<p>14.	You must send this by unencrypted email, at least five days before first salary payment, to the Department’s Payment Team Central Inbox: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>15.	The Department will be validating employment outcomes using employment and earnings data submitted using <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> on line earnings data submitted by employers.</p>

<p>16.	We will share some information about participant earnings with you. This will include a Participant’s first pay date and confirmation that they have reached the earning threshold to achieve an outcome. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chap14">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 14 – Validation</a>.</p>

<h2>Data transfer at the end of programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>17.	You are required to complete Exit Reports for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and WHPERJ1 for <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> for each Participant listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter11">Chapter 11</a>. To improve quality and consistency we have developed a standard form for you to complete. Further information on exit reports can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chap11">Chapter 11 – Programme Completers and Early Exits</a>.</p>

<p>18.	You will have considered the level of information needed in the exit report when you developed your systems and processes. This includes (but is not limited to):  As <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> is a light touch programme the WHPEREJ1 exit form has been updated to reflect this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant Surname</li>
  <li>Participant National Insurance number (<abbr title="National Insurance number">NINO</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Summary – How the Participant benefited from the Work and Health Programme, and the progress against the activities undertaken by the Participant whilst on the Work and Health Programme</li>
  <li>Employability – your opinion on the Participants employment prospects, the type of employment which might be appropriate</li>
  <li>Next steps – your recommendations to Jobcentre Plus on the most appropriate next steps for the Participant. There is a minimum word count for this free text entry to ensure a consistent quality referral.</li>
</ul>

<p>19.	To help ensure you tailor packages to individuals, you should encourage participants to share with you directly any appropriate information about their previous efforts to secure employment/move closer to the job market as will their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach. As some of these customers are vulnerable we ask you to act sensitively when trying to obtain this information.</p>

<p>20.	You may use the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> templates or you may use your own template providing it has been approved by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chap11">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 11 – Programme Completers and Early Exits</a>.</p>

<p>21.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> you must use the streamlined WHPEREJ1 exit form.</p>

<h2>Provider receives a request to erase Participant information</h2>

<p>22.	There may be occasions when you receive a request from a Participant to erase their personal information from your records.</p>

<p>23.	Upon receipt of the request you should acknowledge the request from the Participant and issue a holding response immediately detailing that the query will be dealt with within one month.</p>

<p>24.	You should forward the details of the request to the following email addresses: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@DWP.GOV.UK">DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> and copy in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Enquiries team, email address:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:WHP.Enquiries@dwp.gov.uk"><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>.Enquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>25.	You will receive a generic email containing a reference number and the actions that you should take from the Data Protection Office (<abbr title="Data Protection Office">DPO</abbr>) team. The reference number must be used with all correspondence with the <abbr title="Data Protection Office">DPO</abbr> team.</p>

<p>26.	Before responding to the Participant, you should then consider the following information before agreeing to any information being removed.</p>

<h3>Customers who have been referred to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETs</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and did not start take the following action:</h3>

<p>27.	You should consider the following scenarios and take the most appropriate action outlined below when you receive a request to erase a customer’s personal information.</p>

<p>28.	For Voluntary customers (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core). If the customer never started on the programme, there is no requirement to retain any of the personal information as the referral information will be kept on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>29.	For a Long Term Unemployed (<abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr>) customer (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core). If the customer never started on the programme and were not mandated to any provider interview, before you input a Did Not attend (<abbr title="Did Not attend">DNA</abbr>) code into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, there is no requirement to retain any of the customer personal information as the referral information will be kept on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems.</p>

<p>30.	Once you have considered these scenarios, and you agree to the erasure of the customer’s personal information, you must either issue the accepted letter <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> Acc (letter which approves the request to erase the information) or respond with your own communication.</p>

<p>31.	You should then forward the response email (including letter or communication from yourself) with the reference number to the Data Protection Office, email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@DWP.GOV.UK">DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> and copy in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> enquiry inbox, email address:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:WHP.ENQUIRIES@DWP.GOV.UK"><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>.ENQUIRIES@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>32.	All responses must be issued within one month of receipt of the request from the customer and must contain the reference number supplied to you.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> All additions and changes to the letters (including logos) must be signed off by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> marketing team at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CEPESF14-20.MARKETING-PUBLICITY@DWP.GOV.UK">CEPESF14-20.MARKETING-PUBLICITY@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>33.	For all other scenarios you should consider the following and take the appropriate action outlined:</p>

<h3>Mandated customer who have not started on the programme</h3>

<p>34.	For <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> customer (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core participants) – If you have mandated the participant to attend an appointment with you which they don’t attend, then mandation activity is undertaken and a <abbr title="Did Not attend">DNA</abbr> is input, you must keep all supporting evidence on the compliance doubt. The supporting evidence should be retained in line with current retention policies.</p>

<p>35.	For any <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Customer who is mandated to attend the initial interview, you must keep all supporting evidence, including the notification letter of the time and date of the interview, the notification that the claimant has not complied and any re compliance information.</p>

<p>36.	Under these circumstances, you must follow the guidance and either issue the rejected letter <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> <abbr title="Reject letter">REJ</abbr> detailing the right of erasure to personal information has been rejected or respond with your own communication to the customer.</p>

<p>37.	You must forward the response email (including the letter/communication) with the reference number to the data protection office. email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@DWP.GOV.UK">DATA.PROTECTIONOFFICER@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> and send a copy to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> enquiry inbox, email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:WHP.ENQUIRIES@DWP.GOV.UK"><abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>.ENQUIRIES@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>38.	All additions and changes to the letters (including logos) must be signed off by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> marketing team at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CEPESF14-20.MARKETING-PUBLICITY@DWP.GOV.UK">CEPESF14-20.MARKETING-PUBLICITY@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>39.	For any Participant who has started on the programme, you must retain all information for official functions and duties, the right of erasure does not apply in these circumstances. The following information must be kept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All mandation activity (including evidence)</li>
  <li>All <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> forms including, ESF1420: European Social Fund – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participant Referral Form (Initial), ESF1420: European Social Fund – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> End Data, etc.</li>
