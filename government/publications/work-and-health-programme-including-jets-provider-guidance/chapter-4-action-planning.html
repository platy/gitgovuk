<h2>Action planning (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.	Your evidence of action planning must comply with the Contract including, without limitation, the Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>),  your tender and the Specification.</p>

<p>2.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core following the initial meeting with the Participant, you should start high-level, initial action planning activity. A signature is not required on the Action Plan at this stage. Further information regarding the initial meeting can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 3 – Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start</a>.</p>

<p>3.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core you are required to complete an Action Plan, which has been agreed and signed by you and the Participant, within 20 working days of  receipt of the Participant referral.</p>

<p>4.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> following the initial appointment/first appointment with the Participant, you should start high-level, initial action planning activity. A signature is not required on the Action Plan at this stage. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3b">Work and Health Programme Job Entry: Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 3b – Acknowledging referrals, initial Participant engagement and registering a start</a>.</p>

<p>5.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, you are required to complete an Action Plan, which has been agreed by you and the Participant, within 10 working days of the Participant’s start date. <strong>For selected <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants, the Action plan must have a wet signature</strong>. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature due to COVID-19, annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19 and email evidence, (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the participant’s participation in the programme.</p>

<p>6.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> this is one of your Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>) on which you will be performance managed. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter16">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 16 – Performance Management</a>.</p>

<p>7.	The minimum requirements are that all activities in relation to participants must be recorded in your evidence of action planning.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the Participant understands what they are being asked to do, why they are being asked to do it and when it must be completed by. Where you are notified, or identify that a Participant has complex needs and/or additional support requirements, you must carefully consider any impact these may have on the Participant’s ability to understand or comply with the requirements.</li>
  <li>Set activities on Action Plan which are <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound">SMART</abbr> (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound).</li>
</ul>

<p>8.	Further information on the above bullets can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 - Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements and Chapter 16 Performance management and compliance monitoring</a>.</p>

<p>9.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core make it clear to mandatory long term unemployed claimants where activities are mandatory and issue these to the Participant in writing. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5a">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5a - Mandation to activity attracting a Low Level sanction</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter5b">Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 5b - Mandation to activity attracting a Higher Level sanction</a>.</p>

<p>10.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core hold all ‘live’ mandatory requirements in a single (paper or electronic) file document. This should include a clear explanation of what the activity is, when it occurs, when it must be completed by, and what evidence is required to demonstrate completion of the activity.</p>

<p>11.	Ensure evidence of all interactions are recorded, dated, signed and held for all Participants, in line with the customer journey detailed in your tender. If a Participant cannot or refuses to sign, you must record the reason for this. Where you were unable to obtain a Participant signature due to COVID-19, annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19. Email evidence (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme.</p>

<p>12.	 For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core ensure the Action Plan is reviewed, updated and signed by both you and the Participant in line with the customer journey detailed in your tender. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature due to COVID-19, annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19. Email evidence (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme. Make the information contained in the Action Plan available to the Participant at their request (by paper or electronically depending on their preference).</p>

<p>13.	 For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> ensure the Action Plan is reviewed, by both you and the Participant every 10 working days. The frequency of these meetings can be amended if the Participant prefers a different arrangement. Where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature due to COVID-19, annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19. Email evidence (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme. Make the information contained in the Action Plan available to the Participant at their request (by paper or electronically depending on their preference).</p>

<p>14.	 For both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> ensure all relevant information is included in your evidence of action planning in compliance with the Contract, including obtaining Participant signatures (where you have said you will do so in your tender). For the period of “COVID-19” where you are unable to obtain a Participant signature due to COVID-19, you should annotate the Action Plan with COVID-19. Email evidence (for audit) should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme.</p>

<p>15.	For both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, as COVID-19 restrictions ease and you move back to face-to-face delivery all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents which require a participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the participant. If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit. This applies only to Participants on programme.</p>

<p>16. The Department recommends that you follow the relevant country specific Government guidelines in relation to health and safety for all voluntary participants, and only see those who request or agree to face-to-face support.  If a <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> participant has requested ongoing face-to-face support due to lack of IT equipment or inability to use digital means of contact, you should record the request and the reasons for it at the start of the participant’s time on provision.</p>

<p>17. If a <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> participant is normally supported by digital/virtual means, and they request an ad-hoc face-to-face appointment (which is not due to Government guidelines) you should keep a record of the request including how it was made and the participant’s reasons. This will support audit and future inspections.</p>

<p>18.	 When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained. The COVID-19 period easements are to be used only when you are not seeing the participant face to face due to restrictions imposed by government guidelines.</p>

<p>19.	 Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation</p>

<p>20.	 You must retain your evidence of action planning securely to support compliance checks by European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) compliance monitoring and for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit activity (England only).</p>

<p>21.	 Where you have not been able to obtain signatures from Participants for any forms that require them, and the reason for that is not related to any Government Guidelines you were following at the time, you will need to clearly show that all reasonable attempts were made; date and evidence those attempts for your own audit trail and future inspection.</p>

<p>22.	 Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 – 2020</a> (England Only).</p>

<h3>Consequences</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 20-day completion of the Action Plan for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or 10 working days from Participant’s start date for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, forms part of your <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr> and will be checked during the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Compliance Monitoring process. Failure to meet these standards may result in your failing these checks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Failure to adhere to your contractual requirements on action planning will result in not meeting the audit requirements of the European Social Fund and can potentially lead to the recovery of funds and other financial liabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed background and further information (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<h2>Compliance checks (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>23.	 The compliance checks will review evidence of your action planning at regular intervals against what you agreed to deliver in your contract. Where your Customer Service Standard states that your action planning will include specific criteria, such as agreed actions, target completion dates, frequency of reviews, Participant signatures, the compliance check will check that these steps have been followed to be assured of compliance with your contractual obligations. Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 – 2020 (England Only).</p>

<h2>Audit activity (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>24.	 The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Audit Authority may undertake annual or ad hoc checks on a sample of provider contracts to inspect that delivery complies with contractual obligations. They will check evidence to verify the eligibility of payments made in respect of a sample of individual Participants. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit may request the action plan and check the start date recorded against the date put on the ESF14-20 Initial form. Providers will fail the audit where this information doesn’t match.</p>

<p>25.	 Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 – 2020 (England Only).</p>
