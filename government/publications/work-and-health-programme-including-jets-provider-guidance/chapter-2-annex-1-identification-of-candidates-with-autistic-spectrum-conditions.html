<p>1. In accordance with the Autism Act 2009 (England), and subsequent papers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s Think Autism strategy (April 2013);</li>
  <li>Government’s 2014 Policy Paper ‘Think Autism: An Update to the Government Adult Autism Strategy’; and</li>
  <li>Statutory guidance for Local Authorities and NHS organisations to support implementation of the Adult Autism Strategy (March 2015)</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <abbr title="Labour Market System">LMS</abbr>/Find and Refer and <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> make use of three additional referral opportunities specifically created for Work and Health Programme Participants with Autistic Spectrum Conditions (<abbr title="Autistic Spectrum Conditions">ASC</abbr>), where an individual requests they be used.</p>

<p>3.The purpose of these discrete opportunities is to offer Work and Health Programme providers timely, relevant and pertinent information that enables you to recognise, prepare for and provide the most effective support for Participants with autism. This ensures that any reasonable adjustment solutions can be identified at the earliest intervention (in accordance with the Equality Act 2010).</p>

<p>4. Eligible Participants who choose to declare an Autistic Spectrum Condition will be asked if they wish to request that their referral to Work and Health Programme be made via these opportunities. To ensure the disability condition cannot be inappropriately disclosed, they are identified on <abbr title="Labour Market System">LMS</abbr>/Find and Refer as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Minister (for the voluntary group)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Minister Early Access (for the Early Access groups)</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Where you receive one of these bespoke referrals, you and your sub-contractors must take all reasonable steps to ensure that you prepare for the initial interview, and all subsequent interactions, in the light of this additional information.</p>

<p>6. You should note that for <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> input and Provider payment and Performance purposes, these referrals are treated exactly the same as all other Work and Health Programme referrals and for performance purposes will be added into the appropriate customer group. Participants who enter your programme via these opportunities will also count towards your Starts Profile in the same way.</p>
