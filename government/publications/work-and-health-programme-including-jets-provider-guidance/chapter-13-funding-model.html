<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>1.	The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> is predominantly based on Payment by Results (<abbr title="Payment by Results">PbR</abbr>) to drive sustained work outcomes.</p>

<p>2.	There is no price differentiation for outcomes between Participant groups nor the employed or self-employed.</p>

<p>3.	There are two distinct elements to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> payments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delivery Fee</li>
  <li>Outcome Payment</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Delivery Fee (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>4.	The Delivery Fee will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30% of the Estimated Possible Total Contract Value (<abbr title="Estimated Possible Total Contract Value">EPTCV</abbr>), as estimated by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in its absolute discretion, divided by Estimated Possible Number of Months (<abbr title="Estimated Possible Number of Months">EPNM</abbr>) in which services are to be provided, as estimated by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in its absolute discretion</li>
  <li>paid (without the need to claim) monthly in arrears, at the same level each month, at a date to be agreed</li>
  <li>paid for each month throughout the period between the Call-Off Service Start Date and the Referral End Date up to a maximum of 60 months (see- paragraph 1.30 of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Call-Off Specification for Contract Duration and Implementation and see paragraph 4.25 of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Call-Off Specification for conditions attached to the payment of the Delivery Fee)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may defer Delivery Fee payments if formal performance improvement action is taken as a result of failing to meet service standards. Further information can be found in Chapter 16 - Performance Management and Compliance Monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	The delivery fee supports you in delivering your service to Participants and you are not expected to submit a monthly invoice for this fee.</p>

<p>6.	<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will agree a common date with you so that the delivery fees will be paid monthly in arrears. Any part period for the first month at start-up will be paid on a pro-rata basis.</p>

<p>7. Each delivery fee payment would be generated for payment on the same calendar day each month.</p>

<h2>Outcome Payments (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>8.	For the employed, an outcome payment will be triggered when a Participant earns in the (456 + 182) day period from the Participant’s Start Date on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>, the equivalent of someone working for 16 hours per week for 182 days, earning the adult rate (aged 25 or over) of the National Living Wage (<abbr title="National Living Wage">NLW</abbr>).</p>

<p>9.	Earnings data will be provided by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>). You will not be required to make a claim for employed outcomes (with the exception of Special Customer Records, further details can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter14">Chapter 14 – Validation</a>).</p>

<p>10.	Self-Employed outcomes will be measured through duration in self-employment. You will be expected to keep evidence of all Participant self-employment and claim appropriately after the required period has been achieved.</p>

<p>11.	For the self-employed an entitlement to an outcome would be triggered when a Participant achieves a cumulative period of not less than 182 days (26 weeks) in self-employment. Any period of self-employment can only be counted once regardless of whether the Participant has one or multiple occupations during that period.</p>

<p>12.	A price acceleration cohort model also exists when the number of outcomes achieved by you exceeds the volume of outcomes specified by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.  This is to allow an increased outcome payment to be paid in respect of each outcome achieved above the volume specified by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Please see the Accelerator Payment Mechanism section further in this Chapter.</p>

<h2>Self-Employed Outcome Definition (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>13.	Self-Employed outcomes (The Work and Health Programme Core) will be measured through duration in self-employment. You will be expected to keep evidence of all Participant self-employment and claim appropriately after the required period has been achieved.</p>

<p>14.	For the self-employed an entitlement to an outcome would be triggered when a Participant achieves a cumulative period of not less than 182 days (26 weeks) in self-employment. Any period of self-employment can only be counted once regardless of whether the Participant has one or multiple occupations during that period.</p>

<p>15.	Self-Employed outcomes (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) will be measured through duration in self-employment. You will be expected to keep evidence of all Participant self-employment and claim appropriately after the required period has been achieved.</p>

<p>16.	If a participant is in receipt of the ‘Self-Employment Income Support Scheme’ grant which they received to enable them to continue the self-employment that the Participant started whilst on provision, the duration may count as evidence towards the Self-employed outcome, provided the participant is unable to trade (temporarily due to coronavirus) or trading for a minimum of one day a week and all other Self-employed job outcome criteria are met.</p>

<p>17.	For the self-employed an entitlement to an outcome would be triggered when a Participant achieves a cumulative period of not less than 56 days (eight weeks) self-employment achieved within 238 days from Participant’s programme start date. Any period of self-employment can only be counted once regardless of whether the Participant has one or multiple occupations during that period.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> only one validated outcome can be achieved per Participant and must be wholly achieved in either employment or self-employment. Self-employed earnings cannot be combined with direct employment earnings for the purpose of achieving an outcome. The first job outcome to be successfully achieved will be reflected in <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>. Also, for self-employment validation purposes, a week is defined as a seven-day period where a minimum of one day meets the criteria</p>

<h3>The Job Outcome Definition (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>18.	Participants moving into employed work whilst on The Work and Health Programme Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will be identified by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> solely using <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) on-line data submitted each time an employee is paid by an employer, on or before their pay date. No separate evidence will be accepted.</p>

<p>19.	For The Work and Health Programme Core, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor Participant earnings via <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) on-line data from the first ‘payment date’ for a maximum period of 639 calendar days from (and including) the Start Date. We will continue to look for earnings received within the 639 calendar days.</p>

<p>20.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will monitor Participant earnings via <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> (<abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) on-line data from the first ‘payment date’ for a maximum period of 238 calendar days from (and including) the Start Date. We will continue to look for earnings received within the 238 calendar days.</p>

<p>21.	The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> information will feed into our Provider Referral and Payment (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) system and will automatically reflect an outcome in the <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Pack. Please note, to ensure system effectiveness, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may undertake tests as necessary of the automated payment system to confirm it is delivering the requirements. Remedial action may be undertaken where appropriate.</p>

<p>22.	Prior to starting the Participant on the programme, you must ensure the Participant is not in any form of employment or has had a job offer The Jobcentre Plus Work Coach / Prime Provider will determine if a Participant is in employment or has a job offer, prior to the referral/self-referral (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core only). <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not make a referral if it is identified the Participant is in any form of employment at that point in time.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Between referral and starting the programme there may be some Participants who move into employment/self-employment or have had a job offer. If this is the case, you must enter a Did Not Attend (DNA) on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3b">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 3b - Acknowledging Referrals, Initial Participant Engagement and Registering a Start</a> and or, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter3">Work and Health Programme in Provider Guidance Chapter 3 - Acknowledging Referrals, Initial Participant Engagement and Registering a Start</a>.</p>

<p>23.	Any taxable income defined in your contract as Non –Qualifying Earnings will not count towards an employed outcome for either <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Jets or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core.</p>

<p>24.	Any earnings from furloughed employment (for employment which started whilst on provision) will count towards outcomes as participants are in contracted employment.  Participants furloughed will still be in contracted employment and will receive income whilst on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme via their employer. These earnings will count towards <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>/<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> (Real Time Earnings/Real Time Information) Job Outcome performance.</p>

<p>25.	<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will share the following information with you for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, related to the validation of earning based outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant’s earnings are first declared to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, following a confirmed start on the programme.</li>
  <li>when a Participant on The Work and Health Programme Core has achieved income milestones of £1,000 and £2,000 during their employment.</li>
  <li>an automatic outcome payment once the earning threshold is reached.</li>
  <li>the outcome of the end of cohort reconciliation exercise  using <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) data.</li>
</ul>

<p>26.	<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will share the following information with you for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>;</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a Participant on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> has achieved income milestones of £1,000 during their employment.
  when a Participant’s earnings are first declared to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, following a confirmed start on the programme.</li>
  <li>The outcome of the management information reconciliation exercise undertaken at the end of the programme.</li>
</ul>

<p>27. For both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, occasionally income milestones or earnings thresholds may have been achieved through the participant having received Non-Qualifying Earnings, as defined in your contract.</p>

<p>28.	Non-Qualifying Earnings will not be counted towards an  outcome for either <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>. It could however result in the outcome line being claimed and the closure of the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>  line following payment of the final earnings threshold for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core, or the final income milestone for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>29.	Where you identify that income milestones or an earnings threshold has been achieved due to Non-Qualifying earnings as defined in your contract,  you must notify <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of this immediately. Note the relevant information on form Work and Health Programme and <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> England and Wales – Non-Qualifying Earnings Notification Details and return it to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:whp.enquiries@dwp.gov.uk">whp.enquiries@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>30.	In these circumstances, when you have notified <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of the Non –Qualifying earnings for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will notify you of any subsequent validated employed outcomes as part of the End of Cohort Reconciliation (<abbr title="End of Ccohort Rreconciliation">EoCR</abbr>) exercise.</p>

<p>31. For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, once notified of the Non-Qualifying Earnings, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will undertake a Management Information Revision exercise at the end of contract and notify you of any subsequent validated employed outcomes..</p>

<h2>Accelerator Payment Mechanism (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only)</h2>

<p>32.	The <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> uses a price acceleration model.  Price Acceleration takes place when the number of outcomes achieved by you exceeds the volume of outcomes based on the performance offer as set out in the contract.  This allows an increased outcome payment to be paid in respect of each outcome achieved above the volume specified by <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>33.	For each calendar month cohort of Participants starting on the programme (all customer groups to be included in the monthly calculation of the number of starts for accelerator payment purposes), a standard outcome payment will be paid for the first 75% of the contracted outcome volumes (75% of the performance offer) at aggregated Participant group level.  All further outcomes achieved (above and beyond) will be paid at a higher rate. This higher rate is set 40% higher than the lower rate.</p>

<p>34.	For example - A provider is contracted to achieve outcomes for 60% of Participants who start on the programme. Within the price acceleration mechanism, this would mean that within any particular cohort, the first 75% of the performance bid will be paid at the standard rate.  In this instance, this would equate to the first 45% of the cohort who achieve an outcome (75% * 60%).</p>

<p>35.	Any outcomes achieved above the 45% point will be paid at the higher rate. This is the remaining 25% of the performance bid (i.e. 15% of the cohort), plus any outcomes over and above the bid. For example, if the provider achieves 65% of starts resulting in an outcome within a particular cohort, the first 45% will be paid at the standard price and the residual 20 percentage points (15% remainder of the cohort plus 5% performance above the target) will be paid at the higher rate.</p>

<h2>Qualifying Period (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>36.	A qualifying period of 182 calendar days exists immediately after the maximum time on The Work and Health Programme. Therefore, an eligible employment or self -employment outcome may start within the period on programme or during the following 182 calendar day period. Any outcome must be achieved within the total 639 calendar days qualifying period to be included in the <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Pack. (Please note this is not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Qualifying Period (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>37.	A qualifying period of 56 calendar days exists immediately after the maximum time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> (182 days from starting on the programme). Therefore, an eligible employment or self-employment outcome must start within the period on programme (182 days). Any outcome must be achieved within the total 238 calendar days (182 days plus the 56 days) qualifying period to be included in the <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Pack. The provider has a further 61 days in which to notify the performance outcome.</p>

<h2>Participant moving Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>38.	Where a Participant moves outside a provider contract delivery area, you are still entitled to any eligible outcome relating to that Participant within the eligible earnings window, provided these earnings derive from within the UK. Further information relating to Participants moving to another geographical area can be found in Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance Chapter 10 - Change of Circumstances and Notifications</p>

<h2>Payments to Suppliers (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>39.	All payments will be made through the appropriate IT System/PRAP in line with the amounts set out in your <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> contracts. Please note that <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> can only make direct payments to United Kingdom (UK) bank accounts.</p>

<h2>Payment Control Measures (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>40.	To protect public funds and <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s reputation the Department has introduced additional controls to the Work and Health Programme Funding Model.</p>

<h2>Providers and Supply Chains Employing <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participants (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>41.	Where you or your supply chain partners employ <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participants within a part of your employment business directly relating to <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employment contracts, any income during the earnings period relating to this employment will not contribute to the cumulative calculation of earnings for the purposes of paying an outcome. We refer to this as a non-qualifying period. Where the employment is on a self-employed basis, this period of employment will not contribute to the achievement of a self-employment outcome/ self-employment performance for <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>42.	You must notify <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at least five working days before first salary payment that you or a supply chain partner have employed a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participant within a part of your business directly relating to <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> employment contracts by completing a Work and Health Programme Provider Guidance <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Employment Business Customer Form. This is a vital requirement. You should complete all details on the form including date started and date of first earnings.</p>

<p>43.	The completed <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Employment Business Customer Form must be sent via unencrypted email, at least five working days before first salary payment is made to the Department’s <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) Central Inbox at:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.SUPPORT@DWP.GOV.UK">PRAP.SUPPORT@<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a>  You will receive a receipt notification.</p>

<p>44.	You must complete Part 2 of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Employment Business Customer Form and send via unencrypted email to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) Central Inbox when the Participant leaves employment with you (or a member of your supply chain). This should be sent as soon as the information is available. This should include the date the employment ceased and date of last earnings.</p>

<p>45.	Any forms received after the 639 calendar day period from the date the Participant started on The Work and Health Programme will not be accepted. Any forms received after the 299 calendar day period from the date the Participant started on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> will not be accepted.</p>

<p>46.	To submit a self-employed outcome for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> JETs and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, where the Participant has been contracted to work for you or a supply chain partner on a self-employed basis, <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will require you to complete a clerical - PRaP11.</p>

<p>47.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> you should annotate the form “<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>” and send to The Department’s Provider Payment Validation Team (<abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>) Central Inbox by unencrypted email at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PPVT.LEEDS@DWP.GOV.UK"><abbr title="Provider Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>.LEEDS@<abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>48.	On receipt of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Employment Business Customer Form, the payment line will be suspended. <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will review <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Pay as You Earn">PAYE</abbr> data (and any other information it deems appropriate), at the end of the validation period to establish if the criteria has been achieved from employment or self-employment excluding the period of earnings from the non-qualifying period. If the criteria are satisfied, the outcome will be included in the <abbr title="Deprtment for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> Pack.</p>

<h2>Financial Incentives (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>49.	You must not provide any financial incentive (for example funding and / or payment) to support the employment of Participants. You may provide appropriate services and support to employers to help with the engagement and employment of Participants. A Participant in self-employment to whom you have provided, whether directly or indirectly, financial incentives other than any allowed working capital/equipment payment, cannot qualify as a self-employed outcome or count towards a self-employed outcome.</p>

<p>50.	For Participants in self-employment, where the Participant has a clear business plan which would benefit from financial support through either working capital and or equipment, you may provide up to a maximum of £1,000 for working capital and or equipment per Participant for the purpose of the self-employed business. You must retain evidence of the Business Plan and any payments related to the working capital and or equipment.</p>

<p>51. If you decide to provide working capital and or equipment to the Participant to support their self-employed business, this cannot be in the form of a loan to the Participant.</p>
