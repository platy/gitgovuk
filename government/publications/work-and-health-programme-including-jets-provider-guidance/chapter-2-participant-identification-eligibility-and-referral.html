<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	To be eligible for Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) all Participants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the right to reside and enter employment in England or Wales</li>
  <li>be in one of the eligible categories and are expected to be of working age</li>
  <li>are not on any other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contracted provision</li>
  <li>have not completed <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> previously</li>
  <li>not already have a job offer or be about to start work</li>
  <li>not in any type of employment including (zero-hour contracts)</li>
  <li>not be in receipt of payments from the Self-employed Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-employed Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>2.	To be eligible for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Job Entry Targeted Support (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) all Participants must be resident in England or Wales, fall into the eligibility criteria and be of working age. All referrals will be made by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. However, should it be required during the life of the contract, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may authorise self-referrals as detailed in CV06.</p>

<h2>What is Working Age?</h2>

<p>3.	Young people in <strong>England</strong> must continue in education or training until their 18th birthday. Young people do not have to stay in school; they can choose one of the following options post-16:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full-time education, such as school, college or home education</li>
  <li>an apprenticeship</li>
  <li>part-time education or training if they are employed, self-employed or volunteering full-time (which is defined as 20 hours or more a week). Work and Health Programme is NOT classed as a training provider in this context.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.	In <strong>Wales</strong> young people can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as they are 16 by the end of that school year’s summer holidays.</p>

<h2>Resident in England and Wales</h2>

<p>5.	People currently legally living in England or Wales - UK passport holders (or eligible to hold UK passport); foreign passport holders as long as there is an endorsement in their passport allowing them to undertake paid employment – that is there are no employment restrictions/prohibitions; holders of EU passports (subject to any endorsement prohibiting them from working in the UK). <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to amend these definitions following the UK leaving the European Union.</p>

<h2>Participant eligibility and entry points</h2>

<p>6.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core the majority of eligible Participants are likely to be claiming one of the benefits listed below but a small proportion of Participants may not be in receipt of a working age benefit (see paragraph 16 et seq.):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a> (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) or</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance">Jobseekers Allowance</a> (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>) or</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance">Employment and Support Allowance</a> (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) or</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/income-support/eligibility">Income Support</a> (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>).</li>
</ul>

<p>7.	Further information regarding these benefits (for example differences between <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Work Related Activity Group (<abbr title="Work Related Activity Group">WRAG</abbr>) and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> Support Group) can be found at the links provided above</p>

<p>8.	Jobcentre Plus Work Coaches will use their expertise and skills to perform the key role of identifying eligible Participants from the target groups to participate in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> and then engaging them to access the provision. For referrals made by Jobcentre Plus, they will continue to be the final decision maker for determining if an individual is eligible and should be referred to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>9.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, referrals can be made on a voluntary basis or individuals can be mandated to attend and participate in their first appointment. To be eligible for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> potential Participants must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be of working age (16 in Wales, and 18 in England to State Pension age); and</li>
  <li>have the right to reside and enter employment in England or Wales; and</li>
  <li>be in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and in the Intensive Work-Search regime; or New Style <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> at the point of referral; and</li>
  <li>be motivated to find work and require light touch employment support</li>
  <li>be unemployed for 13 weeks or more (not in any type of employment including zero-hour contracts)</li>
  <li>be in receipt of benefits for 13 weeks or more (periods of furlough are not counted)</li>
  <li>are not on any other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contracted provision</li>
  <li>not already have a job offer or be about to start work</li>
  <li>not be in receipt of payments from the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self-employed Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>10.	Work coaches will use the above criteria to assess eligibility and suitability for participation in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If the claimant is registered as Self-Employed with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, they do not need to de-register to participate in <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core.</li>
  <li>State Pension age can vary by individual.</li>
  <li>The claimant must not have previously started or completed <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance with Legislation</h2>

<p>11.	 For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> you need to ensure you comply with the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> contract for example to enable communication with Participants who do not speak English as a first language, or who are deaf, hearing impaired or have a speech impediment; and where the supplier is operating in an area with a high minority ethnic population, materials in the appropriate ethnic minority language must be made available on request. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes translation services.</p>

<h2>Participants with Disabilities (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>12.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, Participants with a disability can be referred by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the Contractor on a voluntary basis, at the most appropriate time when the criteria below are met, the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has a disability or disabilities as defined by the Equality Act 2010</li>
  <li>can be helped, in the opinion of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the Contractor where appropriate, by participating in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</li>
  <li>if relevant, has already been helped by Jobcentre Plus with their core job search activity</li>
  <li>needs more support than can be provided within the standard Jobcentre Plus offer (or through other available services and provision) and</li>
  <li>has committed to the goal of finding employment within one year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> for Participants with a disability, capacity to participate for any minimum number of hours per week/month will not form part of the decision to refer as there are no minimum hours of support/participation in the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</p>

<p>13.	Participants with disabilities will be referred on <abbr title="Labour Market System">LMS</abbr>/Find and Refer using the opportunity type <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Disability Condition and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Minister for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core (please see Annex 1)</p>

<p>14.	Providers should note that there are Legal requirements for Participants with Autistic Spectrum Conditions; these are detailed at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance/chapter-2-annex-1-identification-of-candidates-with-autistic-spectrum-conditions">Chapter 2: Annex 1 Identification of candidates with Autistic Spectrum Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Early Access Disadvantaged Groups (Not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>15.	Early Access to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core will also be available to a number of disadvantaged groups (see paragraph 16 below). These are groups who may need additional support to move into employment and supporting these groups is a policy priority for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. Allowing early access to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core will help provide support at the right time for these groups.</p>

<p>16.	Referrals for these groups will be at the discretion of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, at the most appropriate time on a targeted voluntary basis, when the judgement of the Work Coach/Contractor is that the Participant would benefit from early access to the programme and the following criteria are met.</p>

<p>17.	The following criteria will be used as a guide for the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach/ Contractor. The Participant:</p>

<ul>

  <li>needs more support than can be provided within the standard Jobcentre Plus offer (or through other available services and provision); and,</li>
  <li>has committed to the goal of finding employment within one year</li>
  <li>has not previously started or completed the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>18.	The Early Access Groups are set out below. If other groups are identified as policy priorities for the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> then they may be added to the list set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an ex-offender (someone who has completed a custodial sentence or a community sentence), or offender (someone who is serving a community sentence)</li>
  <li>a carer</li>

  <li>refugee</li>
  <li>young people in gangs</li>
  <li>victims of domestic violence</li>
  <li>an Afghan Resettler</li>
</ul>

<p>19.

<h2>Long Term Unemployed Participants (Not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>20.	Participants will be deemed to be Long Term Unemployed when they reach the following point in their benefit claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> Participants at 24 months including linking periods</li>
  <li>

  <li>Participants migrated to Universal Credit Full Service (UCFS) from legacy benefits will be considered when their time on legacy benefits including linking rules and their time in the IWSR totals 24 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>21.	Participants who have completed <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> in England or Wales will be excluded. The Work Coach will also consider whether a Participant should be Exempt from <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> or whether participation should be deferred.</p>

<p>22.	Eligible Participants will be referred by the Work Coach to the supplier on a mandatory basis.</p>

<p>23.	These Participants will be referred on <abbr title="Labour Market System">LMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> using the opportunity type <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> LTU and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Minister LTU (please see Annex 1).</p>
