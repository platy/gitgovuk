<h2>Obtaining a Participant Signature</h2>

<p>16.	Where you are required to obtain a Participant signature, <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> is not prescriptive about how any required signature is obtained (with the exception of any signature that is required for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> purposes).</p>

<p>17.	It is your responsibility for any (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Match Funded Participant) that you follow the latest <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> guidelines and that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> regulations take precedence to ensure you meet all evidence requirements. Please also refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance/chapter-11b-esf-requirements-2014-to-2020-england-only">Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020</a> (England only) - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) including paragraphs 71 – 75 for electronic signatures information.</p>

<p>18.	For more information regarding obtaining a Participant Signature, please refer to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance/chapter-1-introduction-and-overview#chapter1">Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview</a> - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) section titled ‘Obtaining a Participant Signature’ which also includes more information regarding signature expectations and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements</li>
  <li>The paragraphs below for specific <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documentation required</li>
  <li>The paragraphs below for specific Action Planning activity required</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Now that all COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery, all documents which require a Participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the Participant. For Non-<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants if the signature box is annotated ‘COVID- 19’ or ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’ you are not required to obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person.</p>

<h2>Provider completes Exit Report Pack with the Participant (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core)</h2>

<p>19.	If the Participant is not in employment or self-employment at the point they cease to be a Participant, you will produce an Exit Report Pack. This will include a summary of the Participant’s time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, along with details of additional support that can be accessed to support them going forward.</p>

<p>20.	The Exit Report Pack must be completed with the Participant and a copy provided to them within the last 10 working days of the provision.</p>

<p>21.	When a Participant’s employment ends during the in-work support period and they return to Jobcentre Plus for support, an Exit Report Pack must be provided to the Participant within 10 working days of the date the contractor establishes the Participant is no longer in employment. You will also maintain a copy of the Exit Report Pack securely, which must be sent to Jobcentre Plus upon request.</p>

<p>22. You must complete all Exit Report Packs with the Participant preferably face-to-face, or via a telephone conversation, video conference or any other method permitted by the contract, annotating the Exit Report.</p>

<p>23. If you are  unable to obtain a Participant signature face to face then documentation should be annotated with “REMOTE DELIVERY”. This must be done promptly and in line with your Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSS</abbr>) to ensure Jobcentre Plus can conduct a completer interview within 15 days of completion of <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core.</p>

<p>24. As COVID-19 restrictions have now eased and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents which require a participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the participant. If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ from COVID-19 Government restrictions, you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong>  Obtaining retrospective signatures face to face only applies to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>25. It is no longer appropriate when delivering provision remotely to use ‘COVID-19’ in lieu of a signature. The department supports a blended delivery model, but this must be based on participant need. Where remote delivery has taken place you should annotate the signature box with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’. A record of the conversation as to why this method was most appropriate should also be retained.</p>

<p>26. The Department recommends that you follow the relevant country specific Government guidelines in relation to health and safety for all voluntary participants, and only see those who request or agree to face-to-face support.</p>

<p>27. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained.</p>

<p>28.	Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> LTU Participants cannot be mandated to undertake this activity as any mandatory participation requirements cease on completion of the Work and Health Programme.</p>

<h2>Provider completes Exit Report with the Participant present for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h2>

<p>29.	For any Participants who are not in employment or self-employment the Exit Report must be completed and a copy provided to the Participant within the last 10 working days of them participating in the programme, if you are engaged with them.</p>

<p>30.	As COVID-19 restrictions ease and you move back to face-to-face delivery all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents which require a participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the participant. If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit.</p>

<p>31.	The Department recommends that you follow the relevant country specific Government guidelines below in relation to safety and only see those participants who request or agree to receive face to face support for all voluntary employment programmes. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained. The COVID-19 period easements are to be used only when you are not seeing the participant face to face due to restrictions imposed by government guidelines.</p>

<p>32.	Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>33. The COVID-19 period easements are no longer to be used. When you are not seeing the participant face to face you should annotate documentation or where signatures are required with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’. A record of the conversation as to why this method was most appropriate should also be retained.</p>

<p>34.	Where you have not been able to obtain signatures from Participants for any forms that require them, and the reason for that is not related to any Government Guidelines you were following at the time, you will need to clearly show that all reasonable attempts were made; date and evidence those attempts for your own audit trail and future inspection.</p>

In these circumstances, you must manually track their remaining time on programme. This will be their remaining time of the 456 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core, plus any extension period for In Work Support (<abbr title="In work support">IWS</abbr>), or 182 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> from their start date.</p>

<h2>Participant completes after a period of in work support (Not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>63.	Where a Participant is in work when they reach 456 days on programme but has not yet met the earnings threshold or a self-employment outcome claim has not been reported, you can opt to give them in work support and extend their participation for an additional 182 days (six months). This will give the Participant a maximum time on programme of 639 calendar days. This extension <strong>must</strong> be input into PRAP before day 456.</p>

<p>64.	Between day 456 and day 639 you can manually end the Participant on the programme in PRaP using the early completer reasons described at paragraphs 59-69, otherwise it will automatically end at 639 days.</p>

<p>65.	Where you choose to extend a Participants time on programme, the final day of the extension will be their new completion date.</p>

<h2>Participant falls out of work during extension (Not applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>66.	Where a Participant falls out of work during the extension, they will complete the programme and return to Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>67.	You should access PRaP, navigate to the Extension/Completion area and select the report for completion tick box and click save to end their extension period and time on programme.</p>

<p>68.	The last date of employment will be their new completion date.</p>

<h2>Early completers of the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>

<p>69.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, an early completer is someone whose time on the Programme ends before the 456 calendar days’ time on the programme is reached.</p>

<p>70.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>, an early completer is someone whose time on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> ends before the 182 calendar days’ time on the programme is reached.</p>

<p>71.	A Participant will complete <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> early in the circumstance outlined in paragraphs 59-69 detailed below.</p>

<p>72.	Where a Participant obtains employment and reaches the earnings threshold, or a self-employed outcome is achieved, they will complete the programme.</p>

<p>73.	The exception to this is when you become aware that a <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Participant appears to be an early completer, due to the earnings threshold having been achieved through the Participant having received Non-Qualifying Earnings (as defined in your contract. In these circumstances, they are not considered to have completed the programme, and you should continue to support them until they either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reach the end of their remaining time on programme (456 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core or 182 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> from the Participants start date),</li>
  <li>enter subsequent paid employment</li>
  <li>reach the end of their <abbr title="In work support">IWS</abbr> period (for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core)</li>
  <li>you are notified of a subsequent validated self-employment outcome.</li>

<p>77.	Participants diagnosed with a terminal illness will have the choice to remain on the programme if they wish.</p>

<p>78.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only in this case, if the Participant had initially been referred on a mandatory basis, their attendance will become voluntary.</p>

<p>79.	If you are notified by Jobcentre Plus that they no longer wish to take part in the programme (via a change of circumstances notification form CEPD1/UC78e), you should enter the date and completer reason ‘46 – Exceptional circumstances’ into PRaP to end their time on programme.</p>
