<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h2>Initial Appointment (voluntary Participant)</h2>

<p>The initial appointment with the individual, refers to the voluntary appointment arranged between the individual and you following your receipt of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. This appointment will be to discuss the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> provision, and potentially agree the individual’s start on the programme. This appointment must take place within 15 working days of you receiving the referral, to meet your Customer Service Standards (<abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr>).</p>

<h2>First Appointment (Participant mandated to first appointment)</h2>

<p>Where the Chapter refers to the first appointment it is referring to the very first appointment you book with the individual which the Work Coach has mandated them to attend and participate in.

<p>9.	This can be via email if remote delivery means no access to post. If it has not been possible to contact the individual, you should still book an initial appointment, sending out details to the individual to confirm.

<p>13.	Once you have acknowledged the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> (this must be within two working days of receipt), you must write to the individual to confirm arrangements for your first appointment with them. You must use the template letter <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> MAN APPT 1 to do this.</p>

<p>14.	It is always necessary to ensure that the timeframe between issuing the Mandatory Appointment Notification letter (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> MAN APPT 1) and the individual attending the appointment is reasonable. Where the letter is posted to the individual, the assumption is that they will have received the notification on the second working day after posting (not including Saturday, Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or bank holidays). It is advisable to allow additional time for the individual to make any necessary arrangements to attend the appointment.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> if the appointment is due to start on the Tuesday at 9am, it would be advisable to send the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> MAN APPT 1 on the preceding Tuesday. It could then be assumed to have been received in good time.</p>

<h2>Method of sending the Mandatory Appointment Notification Letter</h2>

<p>15.	It is not acceptable to use electronic methods, such as text or email, to send the Mandatory Appointment Notification letter to the individual. The letter must be posted to their home address, or handed to them. Where an individual is of no fixed abode use the individual’s correspondence address. You may choose to use registered post to ensure delivery. If it is posted it is deemed to have been received on the second working day after posting (see above).</p>

<p>16.	It is acceptable to communicate electronically with the individual to remind them of their appointment after issuing the letter.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You must write to the individual to confirm arrangements for their attendance at their first appointment with you using the template letter <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> MAN APPT 1.</li>
  <li>You must ensure the timeframe between issuing a Mandatory Appointment Notification letter (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> MAN APPT 1) and the individual attending the appointment is reasonable, as defined above.</li>
  <li>You must either post the letter to the individual’s home address or hand it to them.</li>
  <li>You must take into account any complex needs and/or additional support requirements as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter6">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry Targeted Support (<abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 6 – Working with Participants with complex needs and/or additional support requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> It is only the first appointment you notify the individual to attend with you that they have been mandated to attend and participate in. For any subsequent appointments you may book following this meeting, their attendance will be on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>17.	The initial appointment should take place on a one to one basis.</p>

<p>18.

<p>20.

<p>21.	If by the 15th working day from receiving the referral, you have attempted to arrange for the individual to attend the initial appointment to discuss their potential start on the programme and they have not attended, you should enter a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>22.

Where the initial appointment does not take place within 15 working days of you receiving the referral, and you have not entered a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) code in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, you will fail to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>. You may choose to still engage with the individual. However, you only have 30 calendar days from the referral being made in which to register a start. Following this time, the line will be automatically closed in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>24.	If an individual fails to participate in the initial appointment and you input a <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, or after the 30 calendar day period has lapsed, the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach at their discretion may make a new referral to you if the individual still wishes to take part in the programme.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make the Participant aware of support they will receive from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and issue the ESF2020 information leaflet. The ESF2020 information leaflet can be emailed to Participants using the electronic version published on the Gov.UK website along with all other <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014-2020 Provider Guidance. If a Participant does not have an email address you must ensure the Participant is aware of the information the form contains verbally, make a record of the conversation, and arrange to post it to them at the earliest opportunity.</li>
  <li>You must also remind the Participant of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support throughout their time on provision and have evidence to support this audit requirement.</li>
  <li>An ESF1420m form (Initial) must be:</li>
</ul>

<p>a.	fully completed for each eligible Participant.</p>

<p>b.	correct, including where information is collected 
directly from participants, the gender identity of participants should be recorded (that is, the gender that the participant wishes to be identified with).</p>

<p>c.	completed jointly with the Participant.</p>

<p>d.	signed by the Participant on the start date. The point at which the individual agrees to participate in the programme, following an initial interview is their start on the programme.</p>

<p>64. Prior to 7 May, for participants you were unable to see face-to-face, the ESF1420m Initial form, should be annotated ‘COVID-19’ in the signature/declaration box to confirm the Participant was enrolled during this event. The date should be included and you should obtain confirmation from the Participant it has been issued for audit purposes.</p>

<p>65. Now that all COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents which require a participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the participant. If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit. This applies only to Participants on programme.</p>

<p>66.	It is no longer appropriate when delivering provision remotely to use ‘COVID-19’ in lieu of a signature. Whilst the department support a blended delivery model, this must be based on customer need. Where remote delivery does take place, you should annotate the signature box with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’. COVID-19 will no longer be accepted on any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 1420 Initial and End forms submitted from 7 May 2022.</p>

<p>67.	The Department recommends that you follow the relevant country specific Government guidelines in relation to health and safety for all voluntary participants, and only see those who request or agree to face-to-face support. If a <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> participant has requested ongoing face-to-face support due to lack of IT equipment or inability to use digital means of contact, you should record the request and the reasons for it at the start of the participant’s time on provision.</p>

<p>68.	 If a <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> participant is normally supported by digital/virtual means, and they request an ad-hoc face-to-face appointment (which is not due to Government guidelines) you should keep a record of the request including how it was made and the participant’s reasons.  This will support audit and future inspections.</p>

<p>69.	When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained. Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the Participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>70.	Where you have not been able to obtain signatures from Participants for any forms that require them, and the reason for that is not related to any Government Guidelines you were following at the time, you will need to clearly show that all reasonable attempts were made; date and evidence those attempts for your own audit trail and future inspection.</p>

<p>71.	The COVID-19 period easements are no longer to be used. When you are not seeing the participant face to face you should annotate documentation where signatures are required with ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’.</p>

<p>72.	You should refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Provider Guidance chapter-11b European Social Fund(<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Requirements 2014 –2020</a> (England Only) for further information.</p>

<p>73.	Meetings may take place by video or audio calls and not necessarily the standard face to face requirement. Eligibility and Programme evidence should be obtained prior to the completion of the ESF1420m form (Initial).</p>

<p>74.	The fully completed ESF1420m form (Initial) should be signed by the Participant in doing this they declare that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand provision is being <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded</li>
  <li>have received the ESF2020 leaflet</li>
  <li>are aware and consent/agree that their information will be stored and used for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>75.	Where a Participant is unable to sign the ESF1420m form (Initial) due to a disability for example you must ensure ‘Participant unable to sign’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant unable to sign”. In these cases a mark such as an “x” will be acceptable as a signature, however the identification evidence must be aligned to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirement. The date should be included, and email evidence for audit should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the individual’s participation on the programme</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> As COVID restrictions have eased you should refer to paragraphs 64-71 above. Evidence must be retained for the initial interview and must be retained in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documentation retention requirements where applicable. For further information, please refer to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The fully completed ESF1420m form (Initial) must be sent back to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within five working days of Participant signature.</li>
  <li>Where you are aware that the Participant has <abbr title="Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements">MAPPA</abbr> restrictions with <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> or is an <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> case, you should send ESF1420m form (Initial) clerically to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Administrative Team.

  <li>When emailing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the fully completed ESF1420m form (Initial) annotate the email subject field with the following wording “ESF1420 Export”.</li>
  <li>In the exceptional circumstance that the evidence cannot be obtained it is essential you still complete an ESF1420m form (Initial) and annotate accordingly as detailed in bullets below.</li>
  <li>In the exceptional circumstances that the Participant has refused to provide evidence, you must ensure ‘Participant Evidence Refusal’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant Evidence Refusal.” when emailing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> the ESF1420m form (Initial).</li>
  <li>In the exceptional circumstances that a Participant refuses to sign the ESF1420m form (Initial) you must ensure ‘Participant Refuses to sign’ is also included in the email subject field “ESF1420 Export - Participant Refuses to sign” when notifying <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>If neither ‘Participant refusal to sign’ or ‘Participant unable to sign’ is on the referral email subject field but the Participant signature is missing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will reject the ESF1420m form (Initial) and send it back to you for correction.</li>
  <li>Evidence must be retained for the initial interview and must be retained in line with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> document retention requirements. For further information, please refer to The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements – Eligibility and Results guide.</li>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Consequences: Failure to send ESF1420m form (Initial) back to DWP within five working days of date of Participant signature will result in a failure of your CSS.</p>

<p>Failure to follow the required subject header guidelines when emailing an ESF1420m form (Initial) will result in a rejection.</p>

<p>77.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Provider registers a start</h2>

<p>78.	Once you have acknowledged the referral and engaged with the individual you are required to register the start in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>. To meet the <abbr title="Customer Service Standards">CSSs</abbr> initial engagement and start activity must take place within 15 working days of receiving the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>79.	After 30 calendar days of the referral from Jobcentre Plus, the individuals record will automatically show as a Did Not Attend in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>, unless you have, prior to the 30th day, input the Participants start date, Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) or Did Not Start (<abbr title="Did Not Start">DNS</abbr>). If this occurs, the individual will not be a Participant on the Programme unless subsequently, Jobcentre Plus makes a new referral for that individual which results in a start. Any individual not recorded as a Start within 30 calendar days should be referred back to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Input the individuals start date in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> within 15 working days from receipt of the referral from <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The start date you record in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> must always be the point at which the individual agrees to participate following the initial appointment. This may be a retrospective date if you are entering the start date after the interview was conducted.</li>
  <li>Input in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> the delivery location or end to end sub-contractor you allocate the Participant to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> Failure to register a start as soon as you have taken the action will mean that Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) tracking will not start promptly.</p>

<p>80.	Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#background">Detailed background and further information section</a>.</p>

<h2>Individual starts work or has a job offer between referral and start</h2>

<p>81.	Individuals may report that they have a job offer or have started employment or self-employment in between their referral interview with Jobcentre Plus and engaging with you. These customers should not continue to take part on the Programme</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> this includes individuals that have been employed and then furloughed.</p>

Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in Generic Provider Guidance chapter-11b European Social Fund(<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Requirements 2014 –2020 (England Only).</p>

<p>96.	The initial programme start date must be captured. The start date will be evidenced by the completion of an ESF1420m form (Initial) and evidence of initial high level action planning activity.</p>

<p>97.	You must send the completed ESF1420m form (Initial) back to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within five working days of the start date.

<br>29 Price Street, 
<br>Birkenhead 
<br>CH41 6JN
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h3>Action Planning – minimum requirements</h3>

<p>101.	Following the initial/first appointment with the Participant, you should begin high level action planning activity.</p>

<p>102. You are required to complete an Action Plan, which has been agreed by you and the Participant, within 10 working days of the Participant’s start date. For <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Participants, the Action plan must have a wet signature. Prior to 7 May 2022 where you were unable to obtain a Participant signature, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Action Plan should be annotated with ‘COVID-19’ and email evidence for audit should be gathered and retained to demonstrate the Participants participation in the programme.</p>

<p>103. As COVID-19 restrictions have now eased and you have moved back to face-to-face delivery all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documents which require a participant’s signature should be signed and dated by the participant. If the signature box is annotated ‘COVID-19’ you should obtain a signature retrospectively when they are seen in person, and such form/s retained on file, for audit.</p>

<p><strong>Pease note:</strong> Obtaining retrospective signatures face to face applies only to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>104. When you are delivering face to face, a wet signature must be obtained.  Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the Government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 Secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>105. When delivering remotely due to customer needs, any signature requirements must be annotated ‘REMOTE DELIVERY’. It is no longer appropriate to use ‘COVID-19’ in lieu of a signature.</p>

<p>106.	You should refer to Generic Provider Guidance chapter-11b European Social Fund(<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Requirements 2014 –2020 (England Only) for further information.</p>

<p>107.
