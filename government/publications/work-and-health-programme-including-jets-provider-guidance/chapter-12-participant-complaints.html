</ul>

<p>Further advice on how to respond in this circumstance can be found in Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 2 – Delivering <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision.</p>

<h2>Detailed background and further information</h2>

<h2>Participant makes a complaint against you (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>10.	You must have an appropriate complaints process across your whole supply chain to resolve customers’ complaints. You must explain your complaints process to the Participant in your first contact with them.</p>

<p>11.	Where a Participant is unhappy about the service they receive from you and raises a complaint you should ensure that you follow each step of your detailed process robustly in order to bring the complaint to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>12.	After following all steps in your process you must include in your final response to the Participant a standard text which signposts the customer to contact <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> should they wish to pursue their complaint. The text can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex1">Annex 1</a>.</p>

<p>13.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will mediate between you and the Participant to broker a resolution. If a resolution cannot be agreed between either party, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will undertake a full investigation of the complaint. To ensure that a thorough investigation can take place, you will need to provide all the papers which relate to the complaint. The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> office will ask for these when required. If a complaint is upheld against you at this investigation stage, £5,000 will be recovered from you to go towards funding the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> service for provider complaints in the following year.</p>

<p>14.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will gather Management Information from the complaints that <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> receive. This information will inform contract performance management.</p>

<h2>Participant makes a mixed complaint (against you and Jobcentre Plus) (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>15.	If a Participant raises a formal complaint against both you and Jobcentre Plus, Jobcentre Plus will lead on responding to the complaint. They will contact you for a response regarding the element of the complaint which relates to your provision, agree a final response with you, and issue it to the Participant.</p>

<p>16.	If the Participant remains dissatisfied at this point, they will be advised to approach you directly about any issues which relate to the service you provide. You should treat the first combined response from Jobcentre Plus as the first stage of your complaints process and escalate the Participant issue to the next stage in your complaints procedure.</p>

<p>17.	Jobcentre Plus will deal independently with any remaining issues relating to its services.</p>

<h2>Referral of a complaint to the Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>18.	Complainants should be advised that they can escalate their complaint to the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within six months from the date of the final response that you issue.</p>

<p>19.	On receipt of a complaint, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will contact you to confirm that each step of your internal process has been completed. If they feel that you have not completed your process satisfactorily you may be asked to revisit some steps to seek resolution before <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> are prepared to investigate further. You must deal with any correspondence of any nature from <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> within the stated timescales or at least within five working days.</p>

<h2>The role of the Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>20.	The Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) is an independent office holder, supported by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff. The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> does not act on behalf of Participants, but as an independent arbiter.</p>

<p>21.	The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Office has two primary purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide a free complaint resolution and investigation service to individuals who are unhappy with the final response to their complaint from the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Agency, Business, <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Provider or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Provider</li>
  <li>to support <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Agencies, Businesses, <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Providers or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> Providers in improving their services, by highlighting where things have gone wrong and making constructive recommendations based on the complaints the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Office identify. Recommendations might be systemic in nature or case specific.</li>
</ul>

<p>22.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> has three stages of complaint examination, which will be applied to any complaints made about you. At every stage, you, the provider, will have the opportunity to give your version of events and offer any supporting evidence.</p>

<h3>Stage 1: Resolution</h3>

<p>23.	If a complaint is relatively straightforward, and the Participant has reasonable expectations about what you could do to resolve it, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will liaise between the parties involved and try to reach an agreement which is satisfactory to all. If a complaint is resolved at this stage, then no determination of fault will be made and no recovery will apply.</p>

<h3>Stage 2: Settlement</h3>

<p>24.	If the complaint cannot be resolved, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will request the case papers from you to establish what happened. Equipped with this information <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will be in a better position to consider what needs to be done to put matters right, and what redress might be appropriate. Following the review of case papers, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will propose a way forward. If you agree the actions that <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> propose, and the Participant is satisfied that they address their complaint, the case will be closed. Again, no determination of fault will be made and no recovery will apply.</p>

<h3>Stage 3: Investigation Report</h3>

<p>25.	If <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> is unable to reach an agreement between the Participant and you which satisfies the Participant that their concerns have been addressed, it will prepare an <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Report. The report will set out its findings in respect of each element of the complaint. Where appropriate it will identify areas of maladministration and include recommendations which will focus on what needs to be done to put matters right and provide appropriate redress (including potential financial redress).</p>

<p>26.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will send you a draft, allowing you the opportunity to check factual accuracy and comment on proposed findings and recommendations. You will be expected to provide any comments on the draft within stated timescales (or not more than five working days). Your comments will be considered (though not necessarily accepted) by <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> before the report is finalised.</p>

<p>27.	If a complaint is upheld against you at this investigation stage, £5,000 will be recovered from you to go towards funding the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> service for provider complaints in the following year. There will be an annual review level of recovery between <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Providers.</p>

<p>28.	You will also be liable to pay any financial redress deemed by <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> to be due to the customer. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will apply the following <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy when considering if any redress is due to the customer:</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compensation-for-poor-service-a-guide-for-dwp-staff">Compensation for poor service: a guide for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff</a></p>

<h2>How does the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> make a decision? (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core &amp; <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>29.	The <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> Office will conduct its investigations by reviewing all the existing evidence, and comparing what happened (or was most likely to have happened based on the evidence) with any agreed processes or published standards for the provider concerned. If the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> judges the treatment received by the customer to be below or not in accordance with the agreed standards the complaint would be upheld. If there are no agreed standards relevant to the case, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will apply a ‘reasonableness test’ to the circumstances of the case.</p>

<h3>Learning from complaints</h3>

<p>30.	<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will send the Prime Provider a copy of the final report. This will offer feedback on the complaint that has been considered. Any systemic improvements – for example, the need for clearer wording in a standard letter or leaflet – will be raised with you as soon as a problem is identified.
