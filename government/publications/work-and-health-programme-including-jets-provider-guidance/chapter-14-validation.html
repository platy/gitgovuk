<h2>General Information (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.	You must ensure that you only submit accurate information for employment outcomes to which you are entitled. Where you are aware that a Participant has started employment which cannot be counted towards an Outcome in accordance with your Contract (i.e., any Non-Qualifying Period or Non-Qualifying Earnings) you must inform <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to avoid incorrect performance being recorded. Further information can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter13">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 13 – Funding Model</a>.</p>

<p>2.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will, to the extent it deems necessary, undertake checks on Outcomes you have achieved.</p>

<p>3.	You are required to maintain, on an ongoing basis, a robust system of internal records and control, sufficient not only to support any Outcome claims you make but also to allow you to undertake internal management checks and enable independent testing and validation by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and other external bodies. The records maintained must document how and when the appropriate supporting evidence was obtained and must be accurate at the point any validation is to or does take place.</p>

<p>4.	The risk of records being inaccurate and/or incomplete is wholly borne by you.</p>

<p>5.	Employer names are not received in the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> information within <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.	It is an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirement to record the result which shows a Participants status within 4 weeks after completing the programme. You must ensure you have robust systems in place to assure that the information you are providing is correct. Evidence of an ‘employed’ result may be demonstrated by using information <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have shared with you in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> as part of the automated payment model. All evidence should be stored and retained in line with Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) requirements 2014 – 2020 (England Only)</p>

<p>7.	The onus is on you to collect and retain the job outcome evidence as required. Should any penalty be imposed by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> managing authority due to the availability or suitability of evidence we may pass on any resulting financial penalty to the appropriate organisation.</p>

<h2>Validation Overview (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>8.	For Work and Health Programme <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be Recording Employed Outcomes automatically, based on <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> earnings data. The determination of Outcomes will be solely based on this data, except for those gained by <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> Participants which you should report clerically (see paragraph 80 onwards for details).</p>

<p>9.	For both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>, occasionally income milestones or earnings thresholds may have been achieved through the Participant having received Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract.</p>

<p>10.	 This income will not be counted towards an outcome for either <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>. It could however result in the outcome line being claimed and the closure of the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line following payment of the final earnings threshold for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, or the final income milestone for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>11.	In these instances, as <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> earnings data will not be available, no further outcome information will be sent by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to evidence subsequent eligible employed outcomes. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will undertake for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core an end of cohort reconciliation exercise which will identify any eligible employed outcomes and will notify these to you.</p>

<p>12.	For Self-Employed Outcomes you must report a qualifying outcome to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> (except in the circumstances outlined in Paragraph 9 and 10). Self-Employed validation will be a mix of automated and manual checks pre and or post payment. Currently (see para 12), <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core manual validation is primarily pre-payment; for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>, manual validation will primarily be conducted post-payment. If applicable, the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claims process will also apply to self-employment validation.</p>

<p>13.	If the Participant has received Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract  whilst on the programme, resulting in the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> outcome lines being claimed, any  subsequent Self-Employed Outcome must be submitted clerically using the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 11 form.</p>

<p>14.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> self-Employed validation will be a mix of an automated check and/or manual checks <strong>and will be conducted post-payment</strong> on an ad hoc basis If applicable, the self-employed validation process will apply to the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claims performance notifications process.</p>

<p>15.	For Self Employed Outcomes you must report a qualifying outcome to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may undertake benefit check(s) which will identify if the Participant has a relevant period where they have not been in receipt of primary benefits. This check is typically undertaken prepayment but may be repeated, including post payment. Where the Participant has claimed Universal Credit, a check may be undertaken to establish compliance with appropriate conditionality regime.</p>

<p>16.	If a Self-Employed Outcome is being claimed after <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> lines have closed because of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract,, the Provider will submit the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 11 form to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> which will then prompt <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to undertake the relevant checks outlined above.</p>

<p>17.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may move from or to a mix of either a pre-payment and or a post-payment sampling and may vary how the checks are carried out, within the spirit of the contract, to achieve legitimate outcomes. If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> decides to alter the validation approach in the lifetime of the contract, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may include extrapolation where samples of outcomes are checked from across a wider population of claims.</p>

<p>18.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may conduct pre and/or post payment validation checks to determine whether the Provider is entitled to receive payment(s) against the Cost Claims submitted.</p>

<p>19.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will recover any overpayment(s) including any associated with Cost Claims failing validation. This will be in accordance with the provision in your contract.</p>

<p>20.	In a sampling regime, where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identify incorrect Outcomes, not only will these be recovered but the error rate will also inform any extrapolation calculation, which will be applied across untested like for like claims from the same period.</p>

<p>21.	The validation of job Outcomes will be determined by the type of employment; either the Participant is employed by an employer, or the Participant is self-employed.</p>

<h2>Employed Outcome - Validation Process (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>22.	Participants moving into employed work will be identified by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> solely using <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> PAYE on-line earnings data submitted by employers, subject to the notification by you of any Non-Qualifying Earnings and/or <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> provision for clerical claims at paragraph 80 onwards. This data is submitted to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> each time an employee is paid by an employer and no evidence of this is required from Providers.</p>

<p>23.	Your outcomes will be based on the information contained within this - <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> PAYE on-line earnings data. Further details can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter13">Work and Health Programme including Job Entry: Target Support (<abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance Chapter 13 – Funding Model</a>.</p>

<p>24.	The Outcome achievement period runs for 639 calendar days for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 238 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> from the Participant’s start date. Only earnings received within that period will count.</p>

<p>25.	For The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core), <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will track Participant earnings from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> PAYE data for a maximum period of 701 calendar days from the Participant’s start date and will continue to look for earnings received in the 639 calendar days. Where a Participant completes the programme early the Department will end the registered interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Where an Employed Outcome is achieved, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also end the interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>26.	The earnings threshold may have been achieved through Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract. This income is not counted towards an employed outcome. It could however result in the closure of the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> line following payment of the final earnings threshold.</p>

<p>27.	In these circumstances, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will notify you of any subsequent employed outcomes as part of the end of cohort reconciliation exercise.</p>

<p>28.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will track Participant earnings from <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> PAYE data for the qualifying period 238 calendar days from the Participant’s start date and will continue to look for late earnings received in the 61 calendar days after the 238 day up to day 299. Where a Participant exits the programme early the Department will end the registered interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Where an Employed Outcome is achieved, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will also end the interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>29.	If <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has ended interest with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> as a result of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will notify you of any subsequent employed outcomes as part of the management information reconciliation exercise undertaken at the end of the programme.</p>

<p>30.	For the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) earnings will be cumulative from the Start Date of the 639 calendar days. This could be made up of earnings from one employer or a number of employers at the same time or a number of employers during the 639-calendar day period.</p>

<p>31.	 Earnings prior to starting on the programme will not count towards an Outcome. Earnings from any Non-Qualifying Period will also not count towards an Outcome. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes all earnings during this period, regardless of the source of the earnings.</p>

<p>32.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> earnings will be cumulative from the Start Date of the 238 calendar days but will be sought for 299 calendar days. This could be made up of earnings from one employer or a number of employers at the same time or a number of employers during the 238-calendar day period. Earnings prior to starting on the programme will not count towards an Outcome. Earnings from any Non-Qualifying Period will also not count towards an Outcome. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes all earnings during this period, regardless of the source of the earnings.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> for both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core, and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>, only one validated Outcome can be achieved per Participant and must be wholly achieved in either employment or self-employment. Self-employed earnings cannot be combined with direct employment earnings for the purpose of achieving an Outcome.</p>

<p>33.	As Employed Outcomes occur you will be able to generate a report in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> which details this information. This report will also contain information about when first earnings are registered for a Participant once they have started on the programme. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not supply the name or address of a Participant’s employer.</p>

<p>34.	If the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> line has closed as a result of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract, generating a report will not be possible.</p>

<p>35.	The Employed Outcome and validation process is automated, once an Outcome has been achieved, or 639 days for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core or 299 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> have elapsed from the Participant’s Start Date the line will be automatically closed. You will not have a right to appeal or request reconsideration on Employed Outcomes.</p>

<p>36.	When an Employed Outcome has been achieved you must complete and return an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14-20m End form if not already submitted. There is an exception to this when an Employed Outcome has been achieved as a result of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract. For details on what to do in these circumstances please refer to Work and Health). Programme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance#chapter11">Chapter 11 Programme Completers Exits</a>.</p>

<h3>Cost Validation</h3>

<p>37.	For the COVID-19 period individual elements of the costs contained in the OBCM returns will be subject to audit, assurance and validation on a sampling basis through the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Financial Control Framework. Where underpinning evidence does not support the costs or the costs being charged to the contract the ‘errors’ will be subject to extrapolation and an escalation process. You will need to retain the necessary evidence to support validation in line with the contract and to be specified in more detail later.</p>

<h3>JETs Validation</h3>

<p>38.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may at its absolute discretion, undertake performance validation for JETs. We may vary the approach to validation to ensure ultimately, we only verify legitimate outcomes.</p>

<h2>Self Employed Outcome - Validation Process (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>39.	As the data supplied by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not contain earnings from self-employment, these outcomes are based on duration of self-employment, and you will be required to claim all self-employed outcomes. You must update <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> with the date the self-employment started.</p>

<p>40.	If the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> line has closed as a result of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract, then a <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> 11 form must be submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>41.	It is up to you to ensure that at the point of submitting a self-employed outcome you are entitled to do so.</p>

<p>42.	To enable a successful Self-Employed Outcome claim, you must hold sufficient evidence for the entire claim period (up to and including the last date of the claim period) that satisfies both Work and Health Programme Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>, in England only, <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements and proves that the Participant is self-employed. In addition, you must provide current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant that enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response from the Participant and allow full validation to take place (see: <a class="govuk-link" href="#para61">paragraph 61</a> for primary contact method and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3">paragraph 3</a> for robust control system).</p>

<p>43.	For the avoidance of doubt, any Self-Employed Outcome claim without a date, inaccurate or invalid contact details for the Participant (to note, the information must be accurate at both the point of submission and the point of validation), including but not limited to not known at this address responses, dead letter boxes and unobtainable or out of date telephone numbers, will result in a claim being categorised as an Outcome Fail.</p>

<p>44.	Self-Employment will be tracked solely by you. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not prescribe the way in which you should track or record information about self-employment activity. However, the evidence should demonstrate that it meets the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> definition of self-employment. In addition to current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant, you must obtain evidence to confirm the Participant has been self-employed for the relevant period, this could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration</li>
  <li>Proof of benefit claim closed (letter issued to claimant by Jobcentre 
Plus)</li>
  <li>Bank statement showing details of recent transactions/earnings</li>
  <li>Invoices, purchase orders received/sent recently which are clearly in   relation to the running of business</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this list is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive</p>

<p>45.	You will need to retain a suite of evidence to corroborate the totality of the trading period prior to making a claim.</p>

<p>46.	There is specific information that you are required to input to the Job Details Screen within <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> when you submit a Self-Employed Outcome claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Current, accurate and valid Contact details, including the current address, contact name, full business telephone number and email address (where applicable). Please note, a valid telephone number is always required as this is the contact method used when validating a Self-Employed Outcome, unless in exceptional circumstances another method is used through your prior agreement with the Department (see paragraph 61).</li>
  <li>The Participant’s contact details, where different from above</li>
  <li>Start date of self-employment</li>
  <li>End date of self-employment (where already known)</li>
</ul>

<p>47.	As it is not possible to fully automate Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>  Core) and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Jets Self-Employed Outcomes, manual validation will be required. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identifies that there are a significant number of Self-Employed Outcome claims but the start and end dates, as submitted, are unaligned, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may review your internal assurance processes.</p>

<p>48.	A Self-Employed Outcome for The Work and Health Programme Core will be achieved when the Participant has been in business on a self-employed basis for a cumulative period of 182 days (26 weeks) within their 639-day period. As part of making a successful claim for performance, the supplier will need to identify and must submit Self Employed Outcome claims within 700 days of a Participant’s start date. This is made up of the maximum 456 calendar days on Programme, 182 calendar days qualifying period which self-employed job outcomes are claimable and a 61-day period to claim the outcome.</p>

<p>49.	A Self-Employed Outcome for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> will be achieved when the Participant has been in business on a self-employed basis for a cumulative period of not less than 56 days’ (eight weeks) within their 238 days qualifying period from their start date.</p>

<p>50.	As part of making a successful claim, the supplier will need to identify and must submit Self Employed Outcome claims within 299 days of a Participant’s start date. This is made up of 238 calendar days qualifying period which self-employed job outcomes are claimable/notifiable. There is an additional 61 days for Providers to claim the outcome performance.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> for self-employment validation purposes, a week is defined as a seven-day period where a minimum of one day meets the criteria.</p>

<p>51.	Where a Participant moves into self-employment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) and will not achieve their outcome by day 456 you <strong>must</strong> extend their time on programme, via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, no later than day 456 to enable any Self-Employed Outcome claim to be made. (Please note this is not applicable for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>).</p>

<p>52.	If the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> line has closed as a result of Non-Qualifying Earnings as defined in your contract, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> must be notified of the Providers wish to extend the Participants time on the programme no later than day 456 via a clerical form.</p>

<p>53.	All Self-Employed claims are subject to an Off-Benefit Check (<abbr title="Off-Benefit Check">OBC</abbr>). This check seeks to establish whether the Participant was claiming any of the main working age benefits between date 1 and 2 set by Providers on <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>. Whilst the check may be undertaken pre and or post payment on a manual or automated basis, it is typically an automated check conducted pre-payment against Department systems.</p>

<p>54.	Where the check identifies the Participant was claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or was off benefit for the required 182 calendar days the claim will move into the next stage of validation. Where neither <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or 182 days off benefit are identified, the claim will fail (The Work and Health Programme Core only).</p>

<p>55.	For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> only, where the check identifies the Participant was claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or was off benefit for the required 56 calendar days the claim will move into the next stage of validation. Where neither <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> nor 56 days /weeks of claim period off benefit are identified, the claim will fail.</p>

<p>56.	Following the <abbr title="Off-Benefit Check">OBC</abbr> all outcomes will be put on hold for manual validation. Outcomes will be released if they pass the manual validation or they have not been able to be validated within 28 days of the claim being made, where current, accurate and valid contact details are held (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3">paragraph 3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para4">paragraph 4</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para43">paragraph 43</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para47">paragraph 47</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para61">paragraph 61</a>). All claims will be backed out if the claim fails this manual check (not just non-<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> cases).</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> if your claim passes the <abbr title="Off-Benefit Check">OBC</abbr> but fails manual validation, you are only allowed three attempts in total to claim. If the third claim fails, it will remain a failure and be recorded as an Outcome Fail. At this point the line will be closed. If an Employed Outcome is later achieved, this will be identified and counted as a performance outcome as part of the settlement process at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para69">paragraph 69</a>.</p>

<p>57.	All <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> related claims that fail the <abbr title="Off-Benefit Check">OBC</abbr> will be subjected to manual checking of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> records.</p>

<p>58.	All <abbr title="Off-Benefit Check">OBC</abbr> passes will be subjected to 100% manual validation – either in the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system, to determine if they are/were complying with the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> conditionality for self-employment and/or directly with the Participant. These checks will also be appropriate for those Participants who may have been referred by Signposting Organisations (SOs) where no benefit claim may be held.</p>

<p>59.	For those claims being subjected to manual validation there are three possible validation results – pass, fail, or unable to validate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Pass:</strong> The <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system provides evidence of a cumulative 182 calendar day period for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 56 calendar day period for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> of self-reported self-employment or the Participant confirms the condition for performance award, as set out in the, Self-Employed Outcome validation definition has been met. For legacy claims (i.e., not <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) the Participant confirms self-employment status for the relevant period.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Fail:</strong> There is insufficient evidence within the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> system of a cumulative 182 calendar day period for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 56 calendar day period for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> of self-reported self-employment or Participant supplies information which means the condition for performance award, as set out in the Self-Employed Outcome validation definition, has not been met and/or a combination of both. For the avoidance of doubt, where current, accurate and valid contact details for the Participant (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3">paragraph 3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para4">paragraph 4</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para43">paragraph 43</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para47">paragraph 47</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para61">paragraph 61</a>) are not supplied, this will result in a claim being a Fail.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Unable to Validate (<abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr>):</strong> At the manual validation stage, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has either not been able to obtain a response from the Participant using the contact details supplied by you (you must ensure such details are current, accurate and valid - see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para3">paragraph 3</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para4">Paragraph 4</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para57">paragraph 57</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para58">paragraph 58</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para66">paragraph 66</a>), or the Participant is unable/unwilling to provide the information required to validate the Outcome. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to try to validate the Outcome for up to two months after the claim has been approved and entered onto <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> or submitted clerically. After two months the claim will be considered as a <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> and added to the total of <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTVs</abbr> for that cohort and will be subjected to apportionment at the end of the cohort. This is discussed later in the unable to validate action section.</li>
</ul>

<p>60.	Where validation is conducted through contacting the Participant, the primary method for this contact is via the telephone. By exception, for any individual Outcome claim, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider alternative contact methods to this approach by prior agreement. In cases where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is unable to make contact with the Participant via the telephone, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may contact you to confirm the details you have supplied in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, which you must supply within five working days of request.</p>

<p>61.	You are required to hold and supply correct information which is accurate at both the point of submitting an Outcome claim and at the point of validation of that Outcome and which enables <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response from the Participant. If you do not provide sufficient detail with the claim that enables <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to validate the Outcome, the claim will fail validation. You will be advised of this and have five working days to reply but the claim will remain as an Outcome Fail, unless and until sufficient information is supplied to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to gain a response within the prescribed time which then enables the claim to be successfully passed. Outcome Fails remaining at the end of the cohort will be used in the apportionment calculation.</p>

<p>62.	Validation processes may differ dependent on whether the Participant is in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> or not for both <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>63.	For Participants in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will access pertinent data within a Participants <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> record. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use this to determine if a Participant is gainfully self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes, but may also seek other sources of validation</p>

<p>64.	For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be checking that during a cumulative period of 182 calendar days or more for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 56 calendar days or more for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> the Participant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is in receipt of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> and earnings are declared monthly (in line with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> requirements) to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will be checking if earnings are declared not the amount of the actual earnings.</li>
  <li>is not in receipt of any relevant benefit and has a cumulative period of 182 calendar days for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 56 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr> of trading; or</li>
  <li>a combination of the above, that is: where <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is in payment, earnings are declared monthly (in line with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> requirements), and where <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> is not in payment, the Participant is not in receipt of any relevant benefit and continues trading continuously.</li>
</ul>

<p>65.	Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> confirm a Participant is self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes within their manual pre-payment validation checks, subject to also meeting the Self-Employed Outcome definition, the claim will be sent for   outcome as soon as this is confirmed.</p>

<p>66.	Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identify any Outcome Fails whilst completing their manual pre-payment validation, the claim will be backed out of <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and will not be counted, if it is found to be an Outcome Fail at the post-payment stage it will be backed out of <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and the performance recovered. Should a supplier establish a subsequent valid Self-Employed Outcome for the Participant, the line will be available for them in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, to resubmit another claim. It is expected that the necessary steps will have been taken to establish the validity of the claim and the information supplied with it.</p>

<p>67.	When a self-employed outcome has been claimed and validated an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14-20m End form must be completed and returned if not already submitted.</p>

<h2>Unable to Validate action (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>68.	You will be notified when a Self-Employed Outcome has been counted but may become classed as Unable to Validate and therefore subjected to apportionment at the end of the 700 calendar days for the Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Ccore) or 299 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>69.	In these cases, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will continue to undertake validation activity on the Self-Employed Outcome for a further two months after the award of performance date. At this point <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would cease validation activity on the claim and add the instance to a cohort of <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> claims, prior to apportionment. You will be notified when this occurs.</p>

<h2>Apportionment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>70.	The <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> claims will then be apportioned, <a class="govuk-link" href="#para56">paragraph 56</a> refers.</p>

<p>71.	Prior to the apportionment a final check may be made to determine if an Employed Outcome had been achieved in the period and would therefore remove the <abbr title="Unable to Validate">UTV</abbr> from the apportionment.</p>

<p>72.	The reconciliation will consider the pass and fail rates and the performance achieved by the cohort. The apportionment results will be shared with you and a financial recovery total will be made as and when required.</p>

<h2>Settlement (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>73.	The Department will conduct a check of the start cohort considering factors which may have impacted upon the total figures such as apportionment. If necessary, the Department will recoup any outcomes.</p>

<p>74.	The very last Outcome will be made by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to the supplier no later than 791 days after the last start on The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or no later than 299 days after the last start on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Management Checking (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>75.	In addition to the validation principles set out above, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may also conduct management checks to further verify the validity and robustness of Self-Employed Outcomes claimed.</p>

<p>76.	These checks will support the exploration of controls around Self Employed Outcome. Although these management checks will not form part of the standard validation process, they will aid <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in identifying potential patterns or fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>77.	An example of a management check might include investigating jobs undertaken by Participants or if the Work and Health Programme Participant’s (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) business has a footprint such as an operating website etc.</p>

<h2>Special Customer Records (clerical claim process-<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>78.	Most claims must be submitted via <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> however, where you have a Participant who is granted Special Customer Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr>) status (as determined by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) due to the very sensitive nature of data to be held on the individual for example: witness protection, you are required to submit a claim following the <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> clerical claim process. Where <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> identifies that <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> status is not granted the claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>79.	Where you have a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claim, you are required to print off the PRaP11 form and complete manually.</p>

<p>80.	This clerical process mirrors the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> automated process however as the Department will be unable to monitor earnings on an on-going basis you will be required to track the individual’s earnings and then invoke the clerical claim process at the point the employed earnings threshold has been met. The Provider Payment Validation Team will conduct a clerical off-benefit check and validate employment with employers and/or Participants. Incomplete forms will not be acted upon and will be returned.</p>

<p>81.	Where you have a <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> claim, you will need to follow a clerical process. If you receive an SCR2 clerical referral you must only submit claims on the PRaP11 forms after tracking a Participant’s employment and confirming an outcome has been achieved.</p>

<p>82.	Guidance to assist you in the completion of the form can be found by opening the excel form and placing the cursor over the small red corners of the relevant cells.</p>

<p>83.	For <abbr title="Special Customer Record">SCR</abbr> employed outcomes where you submit a clerical claim, we will attempt manual validation of the claim. If the claim cannot be validated, it will become classed as Unable to Validate and therefore subjected to apportionment at the end of the 700 calendar days for The Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 299 calendar days for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry: Target Support">JETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>84.	You should send your fully completed claim form to:</p>
