<h2>Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>1.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> operates a robust performance management regime to hold providers to account for performance offers within their contract. This Performance Management and Intervention Regime (<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr>) has been developed to support the delivery of Provision, and underpin your contract.</p>

<p>2.	The aim is to support you and ensure you meet the performance levels and customer service standards (<abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>) stipulated in your contract.</p>

<p>3.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will manage your performance at the headline Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>) level, and, for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only the headline Devolution Deal Area (<abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr>) level, at individual customer group level (disability, long term unemployed (<abbr title="long term unemployed">LTU</abbr>) and early access (<abbr title="early access">EA</abbr>) in the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>. For <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only we will also monitor the performance of the individual <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core Participant groups within the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> in order to inform progress towards an outcome. These will be included in the regime as Performance Indicators (<abbr title="Performance Indicators">PIs</abbr>).</p>

<p>4.	There are four levels of this regime:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Standard Action – <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr> Led</li>
  <li>Level 2: Enhanced Action – <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr>/<abbr title="Senior Performance Manager">SPM</abbr> Led</li>
  <li>Level 3: Informal action – Led by Provision Lead</li>
  <li>Level 4: Formal action – Led by Provision Lead</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	All levels of the <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> can run independently or concurrently. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will with reasonable discretion be able to take action at any level at any time.</p>

<p>6.	Generally, all contracts must have a Provider Action Plan in place submitted by the Contract Operational Lead to the <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr>. Subject to the agreement of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Provision Lead, Providers with a Contract at Level 1 will be advised if a Provider Action Plan is not required. Unless advised otherwise, the Provider Action Plan is required to be in place immediately following the contract implementation period and reviewed at each Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) meeting.</p>

<p>7.	An example of the Provider Action Plan to be used is included at Annex A. You may use your own version if preferred, as long as it includes all areas covered in the example Provider Action Plan at Annex A.</p>

<p>8.	The Provider Action Plan should include any improvement activity, how and over what timescale you expect to achieve/exceed minimum performance levels. All actions in the plan should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound (<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound">SMART</abbr>) and longer-term actions should incorporate <abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound">SMART</abbr> milestone targets.</p>

<p>9.	If a Flightpath is required, this should be included as an annex to the Plan. You should also supply a summary breakdown of current performance for all direct delivery sites and Supply Chain partners in a format to be agreed with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager. This should be included as annex to the plan and updated each month.</p>

<p>10.	<abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> intervention levels will not necessarily be applied sequentially, e.g., if appropriate, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may move from <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Intervention Level 1 directly to <abbr title="Performance Management and Intervention Regime">PMIR</abbr> Intervention Level 3, without applying Level 2.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Standard Action – <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr> Led</h2>

<p>11.	May include actions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> holding regular Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) meetings with you which will focus on achieving contractual performance levels and (<abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>) including but not limited to, on an in-month, rolling three month, rolling 12 month, cumulative and relative performance basis, in line with the Contract from Day One, CV04 and CV06. Your Provider Action Plan will be reviewed as part of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>. These meetings may be virtual, delivered through compatible on-line meeting platforms or via telephone conference facilities. Your <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr> will discuss and confirm arrangements with you.</li>
  <li>Performance Management on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of your contract. Other staff, including those representing Jobcentre Plus, may also attend these meetings. You will be required to provide monthly Management Information five working days prior to the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 2: Enhanced Action – <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr>/<abbr title="Senior Performance Manager">SPM</abbr> Led</h2>

<p>12.	Whilst at Level 1, if it is determined that you may not achieve the performance levels or <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>, your <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr> may undertake informal action to escalate you to Level 2, you will be notified of this in writing. You will be required to enhance your Provider Action Plan, to capture all agreed actions for performance improvement. You will also be required to provide a flightpath including incremental performance and pipeline data that may lead to outcomes to improve the achievement of the performance levels and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr> in line with the Contract. Formats to be agreed with your <abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Level 3: Informal Action – Led by Provision Lead</h2>

<p>13.	If the remedial actions at Level 1 or 2 were unable to lift your performance in order to meet the performance levels and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr> in the Contract, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Senior Performance Manager (<abbr title="Senior Performance Manager">SPM</abbr>) can propose escalation to Level 3.</p>

<p>14.	You will be invited to a meeting to discuss your performance with Senior Managers and receive a Management letter to request that your performance improves. At this stage you will be informed that formal action could be taken in the event that performance doesn’t improve.</p>

<h2>Level 4: Formal Action – Led by Provision Lead</h2>

<p>15.	If you fail to meet the required standards at Level 1,2 or 3, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Employment Account Division (<abbr title="Employment Account Division">EAD</abbr>) and Commercial Directorate will take formal action to address the performance issues, considering and applying, where applicable, all the remedies available to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> under the contract.</p>

<h2>Performance Indicators</h2>

<p>16.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will manage your performance against Performance Indicators (PI). These will include the individual Participant groups within the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> (for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only), and progress towards an outcome as informed by Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) commencement, and the £1,000 and, for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only, £2,000 milestones. Where a PI potentially indicates a future failure of a tender Minimum Performance Level (<abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>), <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may require you to develop an improvement plan to remedy this by issuing a Performance Indicator Course of Action Notice.</p>

<p>17.	Subsequent failure of the improvements stated within your Provider Action Plan and/or <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr> does not remove or impact the rights and remedies available to the authority.</p>

<h2>Relative Performance</h2>

<p>18.	Ranking tables will be used to monitor performance against other providers and provision based bench marks.
Cohort Profiles and Management Information</p>

<p>19.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will measure your performance using cohort measures based on the information you provided as part of your tender (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or Service Delivery Assessment (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) and which has been incorporated in to your Contract.</p>

<p>20.	The outcome definition for both employed and self-employed must have been met at or before 639 days (for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 238 days (for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) from the Start Date. For self-employed outcomes, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will allow you until 700 days (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core) or 299 days (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) from the Start Date to submit a claim.</p>

<p>21.	Performance will be measured using HMRC data, the Provider Referral and Payment system (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr>) and, in the case of self-employed Participants, from outcome claims submitted by you. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> produces <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> Packs on a monthly basis. The <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> packs will contain the data input to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment System">PRaP</abbr> regarding your customers, cohort profiles performance against the performance levels and in the Contract. This will allow the Department to monitor your performance across various time periods including cohort, rolling three months, rolling 12 months and cumulative from day one of the contract.</p>

<p>22.	You will be required to provide a performance return containing key data that drives the performance of the Contract including schedule 20 and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr> return by 15th working day of the month.</p>

<p><strong>Local Engagement Meeting (<abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr>) – applicable to <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core only</strong></p>

<p>23.	<abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMS</abbr> will be made up of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> representatives from current and/or future DDAs as they are created within the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>, representatives from the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> authority and local area stakeholders, including Jobentre Plus. This will provide a forum in which we can discuss and support performance improvement, service delivery and service integration across the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> and the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr>. At the sole discretion of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> you may be invited to discuss performance at these meetings.</p>

<p>24.	The agenda will include a discussion of your performance in the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr>, particularly relating to your integration with local services. The <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> is also an opportunity to discuss future direction and impact any changes affecting delivery of the provision.</p>

<p>25.	The <abbr title="Local Engagement Meeting">LEM</abbr> will provide an opportunity to ensure that the Programme is helping the appropriate claimants into work, and to address areas of concern. This may include discussion on referrals to you from Jobcentre Plus as well as the Participants being signposted to Jobcentre Plus from external organisations. It will enable a collaborative approach to be taken between all stakeholders to contribute to the successful delivery of the programme.</p>

<p>26.	 Integration will remain a Critical Success Factor of <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core throughout the COVID 19 relief period. The frequency and format of <abbr title="Local Engagement Meetings">LEMs</abbr> may be subject to change about which your Performance Manager will keep you informed.</p>

<h2>Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>)</h2>

<p>27.	The purpose of the Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) is to formally examine your contract performance including your Supply Chain’s performance for individual contract(s). All relevant aspects of performance will be assessed against contractual requirements and outcomes.</p>

<p>28.	The usual frequency of <abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr> is monthly, however, this can be reviewed as advised by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> at its absolute discretion.</p>

<h2>Content of the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> meeting</h2>

<p>29.	The <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> will focus on the ongoing achievement of performance levels and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>. Depending on priority issues for each meeting, the <abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr> is likely to cover some/all of the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance including relative performance</li>
  <li>Expected future performance based on information available (e.g. earning commencements and current performance levels)</li>
  <li>Review of Provider Action Plan – including improvement expectations agreed at the last meeting</li>
  <li>Sub-contractor (end to end performance) and Supply Chain performance</li>
  <li>Employer engagement</li>
  <li>Collaborative working (including Operational Process Updates)</li>
  <li>Decision Making and Appeals (<abbr title="Decision Making and Appeals">DMA</abbr>), where appropriate</li>
  <li>Participant experience/Customer Insight</li>
  <li>Assurance and Compliance Monitoring</li>
  <li>Performance Manager checks</li>
  <li>Exit feedback/CV/references</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy changes – latest <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> memos.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h3>Performance Requirements – <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core</h3>

<p>30.	The Performance levels you are required to deliver for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core are set out in schedule 2 of your contract and the <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr> are detailed in schedule 6 of your CV04 variation.</p>

<p>31.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will actively monitor the service you deliver against these performance levels and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>. This will be done using a combination of IT based management information, provider <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> submission, Assurance and Compliance checks conducted via a range of mediums. The following tables and paragraphs show the categories under which performance will be measured and managed and the standards which relate to the delivery of customer service.</p>

<p>32.	The tender Minimum Performance Levels (tMPLs) for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core are:</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>	1: <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> level <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>.</strong></p>

<p>This is the performance target for the <abbr title="long term unemployed">LTU</abbr> group attending <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> on a mandatory basis, taken from your tender offer. Performance will be measured and managed on a cohort profile basis.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>	5:	<abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> level <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>.</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr> for the <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> will be measured both distinctly from and as part of the <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr> for the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> (tMPL1). Performance will be measured and managed on a cohort profile basis.</p>

<p>This is an aggregate of the performance against performance targets for each of the separate customer groups at <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr> level; a <abbr title="Devolution Deal Area">DDA</abbr>-level % conversion rate.</p>

<p>33.	Please see the table at Annex B for more detail (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core).</p>

<h3>Performance Requirements – <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>34.	The Performance levels you are required to deliver for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> are set out in variation CV06.</p>

<p>35.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will actively monitor the service you deliver against these performance levels and <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr>. This will be done using a combination of IT based management information, provider <abbr title="management information">MI</abbr> submission, Assurance and Compliance checks conducted via a range of mediums. The following tables and paragraphs show the categories under which performance will be measured and managed and the standards which relate to the delivery of customer service.</p>

<p>36.	<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> does not have separate Customer Groups, therefore there is only one <abbr title="tender Minimum Performance Level">tMPL</abbr>: a 22% conversion rate of starts to achievement of £1,000 earnings.

<h2>Assurance and Compliance Monitoring</h2>

<p>39.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="performance management">PMs</abbr> and/or Performance Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>’s) may perform evidence based checks to identify if providers are adhering to the delivery models set out in their contracts. These checks may incorporate the use and quality of Participant Action Plans; Participant engagement; <abbr title="Decision Making and Appeals">DMA</abbr> activity (where appropriate); delivery of the <abbr title="customer service standards">CSSs</abbr> and to seek assurance that you are addressing the Participants barriers to employment.</p>

<p>40.	If there is a performance concern or an area of weakness identified, <abbr title="performance management">PMs</abbr> or  <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>’s may undertake ‘Go-Look-See’ and/or ‘Deep Dive’ visits. These may be undertaken remotely. <abbr title="performance management">PMs</abbr> will discuss fully the objective of these visits and how they will be undertaken. <abbr title="performance management">PMs</abbr> may also ask to attend sub-contractor end-to-end delivery and supply chain meetings.</p>

<p>41.	In England only, adherence to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Regulatory Requirements, in terms of Marketing and Publicity; Sustainable Development; Equality and Diversity and Document Retention will be checked. Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in the Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 – 2020 (England Only).</p>

<p>42.	Any issues arising from <abbr title="Performance Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>/<abbr title="performance management">PM</abbr> checks will be reported to you and relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders and discussed at <abbr title="Contract Performance Reviews">CPRs</abbr></p>

<p>43.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to carry out physical/remote checks on documentation as part of this process.</p>

<h2>Evaluation and Reporting</h2>

<p>44.	Independent evaluation will be an important element of your Provision and you will be asked to co-operate in a range of evaluations commissioned by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and the European Commission.</p>

<p>45.	Other interested parties and Government Departments as part of wider cross-government agendas may commission further evaluations and your assistance will be expected when required.</p>

<p>46.	As part of this evaluation work, researchers may wish to visit and interview you and your sub-contractors and supply chain, Participants and employers involved in your Provision. You may be asked to provide the relevant contact details and, in order to facilitate this process; you should seek advance agreement from Participants to take part in evaluations.</p>

<p>47.	Advance notice will be given where your co-operation is required.</p>

<p>48.	An end of project evaluation report will also be required, highlighting innovative delivery practices and achievements against the cross cutting themes.</p>

<h2>Provider Assurance Team</h2>

<p>49.	The primary purpose of the Contract Management and Partner Delivery (<abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr>) Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) is to provide the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>  <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> Director with an assurance that Prime Provider systems of internal control are such that payments made to Prime Providers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Treasury requirements.</p>

<p>50.	<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews and tests Prime Providers’ systems of internal control to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> expenditure, and service delivery including the arrangements you have in place for your supply chain.</p>

<p>51.	This work is carried out by the <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> by reviewing your internal control systems to assess your ability to manage risk across three key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Governance Arrangements – covering the Provider’s governance arrangements, systems for tracking and reporting performance and their anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>Service Delivery – includes the Provider’s systems for starting, ending and moving Participants through F2F Provision and generally looks to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is getting the service it is paying for. This section also covers management of the supply chain</li>
  <li>Claim Procedures and Payments – looks to ensure that Prime Providers have in place effective systems to support their claims for payment, including appropriate segregation of duties</li>
</ul>

<p>52.	The <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> operates at a national level, enabling it to present <abbr title="Contract Management and Partner Delivery">CMPD</abbr> roviders operating across regions with a single view of the effectiveness of their systems; each Prime Provider will have a nominated Senior Provider Assurance Manager as a single point of contact within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for management of assurance related issues/concerns.</p>

<p>53.	On completion of each review, providers are awarded an assurance rating from the following four categories – weak, limited, reasonable and strong. Providers will also receive a formal report detailing the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement. Where weaknesses have been identified providers are asked to complete an Action Plan setting out appropriate steps for improvement. This is followed up until <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> is satisfied that all actions have been undertaken. The timescale for reviews is determined by risk.</p>

<p>54.	Findings from each review are routinely reported to the relevant Provision Leads and other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders. Remedial actions may be taken in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if, following a Weak or Limited Assurance level from the Provider Assurance Team, the Prime Providers subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or the Prime Provider is awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if you fail to submit and/or implement the action plan within the agreed timescale; or</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that you may be acting inappropriately, the team will refer to Counter Fraud and Investigations as the experts trained in the legalities and techniques required to carry out formal investigations.</li>
</ul>

<p>55.	<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will periodically publish Prime Provider assurance levels and names (note - this will not include reports or supporting information).</p>

<p>56.	<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will work with you to ensure that you understand what is expected.
