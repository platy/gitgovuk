<h2>Epidemiological update</h2>

<p>As of 16 June 2022, 2,591 cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (<abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr>) have been reported by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/mers-cov/mers-outbreaks.html" rel="external"><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr></a>, with at least 894 related deaths. The majority of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> cases have been reported from the Arabian Peninsula, with one large outbreak outside this region involving 186 cases in the Republic of Korea (<abbr title="Republic of Korea">RoK</abbr>) in 2015. Cases have been exported to other countries outside of the Middle East, including cases being identified in the UK and South Korea in August and September 2018 respectively.</p>

<p>On 22 August 2018, Public Health England (PHE) <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/31-august-2018-mers-united-kingdom/en/" rel="external">reported a laboratory-confirmed case of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> infection</a> in a resident of the Middle East who had travelled from Saudi Arabia. In response to this, public health measures were implemented including identification of exposed contacts and provision of health advice. This was the third imported MERS case reported by the UK; the previous case was reported in 2013 was associated with 2 infections in close contact.</p>

<p>Excluding the 2015 outbreak in <abbr title="Republic of Korea">RoK</abbr>, the majority of reported cases of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> worldwide have been from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (<abbr title="Kingdom of Saudi Arabia">KSA</abbr>).</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> in Saudi Arabia</h2>

<p>In <abbr title="Kingdom of Saudi Arabia">KSA</abbr>, cases of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> occur throughout the year; there is currently no evidence of sustained community transmission; human-to-human transmission is most likely to occur in healthcare facilities and household clusters. Large outbreaks linked to healthcare facilities are a feature of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> and have occurred both within the Middle East and <abbr title="Republic of Korea">RoK</abbr>. This underlines the significance of healthcare facilities as a risk factor for amplifying infection, but also the importance of effective and rapid implementation of infection prevention and control practices for possible cases to limit the potential for onward transmission to other patients and staff.</p>

<p>Outside of hospital outbreaks and smaller household clusters, reported cases are sporadic and usually occur in individuals with a history of contact with camels or camel products such as consumption of raw camel milk. The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, previously Public Health England) will continue to monitor the situation in <abbr title="Kingdom of Saudi Arabia">KSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Risk assessment</h2>

<p>The previous sporadic imported cases to the UK highlight the continued risk of imported cases to the UK, reflecting the epidemiology of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> infection in the Middle East. It is therefore imperative that health professionals remain vigilant for clinical presentations compatible with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Early identification and rapid implementation of appropriate infection control measures for possible cases, and reporting of these to local health protection teams is crucial.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The risk of infection with MERS-CoV to UK residents in the UK remains very low.</p>

<p>The risk of infection with MERS-CoV to UK residents travelling to the Middle East is very low, but may be higher in those with exposure to specific risk factors within the region, such as camels (or camel products) or the local healthcare system.</p>
</div>

<p>Testing for&nbsp;<abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr>&nbsp;is warranted for persons who meet the possible case definition together with rapid implementation of appropriate infection control measures while awaiting results of testing.</p>

<p>The majority of outbreaks of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> in the Middle East have been linked to healthcare settings. A previous <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> mission to Saudi Arabia concluded that <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.emro.who.int/fr/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/news/mers-mission-saudi-arabia-2015.html" rel="external">gaps in infection control measures have most likely contributed to these outbreaks;</a> this reinforced the importance of strict adherence to recommended infection control measures in healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>Where UK infection control procedures have been followed, the probability of acute respiratory infection in a healthcare worker caring for a case of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr>, or a case of severe acute respiratory infection of unknown aetiology in the intensive care unit (<abbr title="intensive care unit">ICU</abbr>), is due to <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> is very low, but warrants testing. Any healthcare worker who develops an acute respiratory illness and has recently been in contact with a confirmed case of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> would be tested for the virus. The risk will be higher for healthcare workers exposed to <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> who have not adhered to UK infection control procedures, such as the use of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>

<p>The risk to contacts of confirmed cases of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> infection is low, but contacts should be followed up for 14 days following last exposure and any new febrile or respiratory illness investigated urgently for <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-clinical-management-and-guidance">information and guidance on <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr></a> is available.</p>

<h2>Travel advice</h2>

<p>All travellers to the Middle East are advised to avoid contact with camels as much as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>travellers should practice good general hygiene measures, such as regular handwashing with soap and water at all times, but especially before and after visiting farms, barns or market areas</li>
  <li>travellers are advised to avoid raw camel milk and/or camel products from the Middle East</li>
  <li>travellers are also advised to avoid consumption of any type of raw milk, raw milk products and any food that may be contaminated with animal secretions unless peeled and cleaned and/or thoroughly cooked</li>
  <li>travellers should follow the advice of local health authorities; there are currently no travel restrictions in place</li>
  <li>travellers developing fever and cough within 14 days of travel from the Middle East should seek medical advice and must report their travel history so that appropriate clinical assessment, infection control measures and testing can be undertaken</li>
  <li>people who are acutely ill with an infectious disease are advised not to travel but to seek health advice immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Hajj and Umrah</h2>

<p>International pilgrims will be allowed to undertake the Hajj in 2022.</p>

<p>The last Hajj where large numbers of international pilgrims could attend was in 2019. There was no reported increase in travel-related <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> cases for this latest or previous Hajj pilgrimages. However, cases of <abbr title="Middle East Respiratory Syndrome">MERS-CoV</abbr> have been imported to countries outside of Saudi Arabia following return from Umrah, a separate pilgrimage which can be performed throughout the year, as illustrated by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/08-january-2018-mers-cov-malaysia/en/" rel="external">most recent Malaysian case</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> remains vigilant and closely monitors developments in the Middle East and in the rest of the world where new cases have emerged and continues to liaise with international colleagues to assess whether our recommendations need to change.</p>
