<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>We set out in our funding agreements and funding rules the requirement for providers we fund to obtain an annual report from an external auditor that provides assurance on their arrangements to manage and control their delivery subcontractors.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to give providers additional information about this requirement and outline the information we need from them each year.</p>

<p>This guidance must be read alongside our funding agreements and the associated subcontracting funding rules for the provision being delivered.</p>

<p>Further to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/education-and-skills-funding-agency/subcontracting-post-16-education-and-training-with/supporting_documents/Reforms%20to%20subcontracting%20education%20for%20learners%20over%2016%20government%20consultation.pdf" rel="external">consultation</a> and subsequent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/896647/consultation-response-_Reforms_to_subcontracting_education_for_learners_over_16.pdf" rel="external">response</a>, we have updated this guidance for the 2020 to 2021 funding year.  An Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) standard will be developed for the 2022 to 2023 funding year. This guidance will be in place until further notice. Further information will be available in the follow up document to the subcontracting consultation response.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Providers in scope</h2>

<p>Providers are in scope if they have entered subcontracts to deliver provision with an aggregate value of more than £100,000 each academic year (from 1 August to 31 July). This aggregate value includes apprenticeships, 16 to 19 programmes, traineeships and all other adult provision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Definitions</h2>

<p>A subcontractor is a separate legal entity that has an agreement with a provider to deliver any element of the education and training we fund. This includes delivery of apprenticeship training and/or on-programme assessment for new apprenticeships that started from 1 May.</p>

<p>An external auditor is a professionally qualified person from an organisation external to the provider that is able to provide an independent report on their subcontracting systems and controls. The person should be registered with an appropriate professional body. For the sake of clarity, the external auditor cannot be an employee, director, trustee, shareholder or any other similar party with a vested interest in the provider, irrespective of whether their normal role is to carry out their audit work. The external auditor does not necessarily have to be a provider’s existing external auditor.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Process</h2>

<p>The provider selects and engages an external auditor that fulfils the definition above.</p>

<p>The external auditor must be able to sign the certificate provided.</p>

<p>The provider obtains a report from their chosen external auditor that provides assurance on the systems and controls they have in place, in the relevant year, for managing subcontracted delivery.</p>

<p>The report must reflect the provider’s end-to-end subcontracting process and the subcontracting requirements set out in their funding agreements and the associated funding rules for the respective year.</p>

<p>We are not prescribing the process that the auditor must follow in undertaking the assignment. It is the provider’s role to agree this with their auditor.</p>

<p>Once the report has been completed, the provider’s accounting officer or senior responsible person must review it. Examples of the senior responsible person are chief executive, managing director, principal or their equivalent.</p>

<p>The provider’s accounting officer or senior responsible person must sign the certificate. The auditor must also sign the certificate. We will not accept transmittal letters or other forms of letter as a replacement for the certificate.</p>

<p>A copy of the report must also be sent to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> along with the certificate We will review it as part of our compliance arrangements.</p>

<p>If the external auditor has indicated that an implementation plan is required following their audit, this must be sent to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> also. We will review it as part of our compliance arrangements.</p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the external auditor will not be liable to us for the work it has undertaken for the provider.</p>

<p>You must return your certificate and report to us by Document exchange.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Return by Document exchange</h2>

<p>You must return your report and certificate to us by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange/user-guide" rel="external"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> Document exchange</a>.</p>

<p>To upload your documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>log into Document exchange</li>
  <li>select ‘Send a new document’</li>
</ul>

<p>You must separately return both your certificate and report to us.</p>

<p>To return your report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choose ‘Subcontracting external assurance doc’ as the document type</li>
</ul>

<p>To then return your certificate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choose ‘Subcontracting external assurance cert’ as the document type</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange/user-guide" rel="external">guidance on how to use Document exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Providers can check if they are in scope to take action and ask other questions using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external"><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> enquiry form</a>.</p>
