<p><strong>Guidance on the regulations as they apply to craft being supplied in or into Great Britain.</strong></p>

<p>November 2021</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This Guide is for businesses placing recreational craft on the market in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recreational-craft-regulations-2017">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>This Guide is designed to help you understand The Recreational Craft Regulations 2017, as amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (referred to in this document as “The 2017 Regulations”). The 2017 Regulations set out the requirements that must be met before products can be placed on the GB market. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure safe products are placed on the GB market by requiring manufacturers to show how their products meet the ‘essential requirements’.</p>

<p>This guidance is relevant to manufacturers, importers (including private importers) and distributors of recreational craft, personal watercraft and certain engines and other specified components. It will also be of interest to consumers and approved bodies. 
This guidance also sets out the enforcement regime.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Legislative Background</h2>

<p>The Recreational Craft Regulations 2017 implement Directive 2013/53/EU on recreational craft and personal watercraft. The EU Withdrawal Act 2018 preserves the 2017 Regulations and enables them to be amended so as to continue to function effectively now the UK has left the EU. Accordingly, Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-1">see footnote 1</a> fix any deficiencies that arose from the UK leaving the EU (such as references to EU institutions) and make specific provision for the GB market.</p>

<p>There is therefore one set of UK 2017 Regulations, but some of the provisions apply differently in NI for as long as the Northern Ireland Protocol is in force. References to the 2017 Regulations in this guidance are references to those Regulations as they apply in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recreational-craft-regulations-2017">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>The products covered by the Regulations are as follows (collectively referred to as “products” in this guidance):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Recreational craft and partly completed recreational craft which are watercraft excluding personal watercraft intended for sports and leisure purposes of hull length from 2.5m to 24m regardless of the means of propulsion.</li>
  <li>Personal watercraft (e.g. jet skis) and partly completed personal watercraft, which are watercraft for sports and leisure purposes of less than 4m in hull length which use a propulsion engine having a water jet pump as its primary source of propulsion and designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on, rather than within, the confines of the hull.</li>
  <li>Components of watercraft listed in Schedule 2 (when placed on the market separately and when intended for installation in watercraft).</li>
  <li>Propulsion engines installed or intended for use in watercraft.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a number of exclusions from the Regulations including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>watercraft intended solely for racing (labelled as such by the manufacturer);</li>
  <li>canoes and kayaks designed to be propelled solely by human power, gondolas and pedalos;</li>
  <li>surfboards;</li>
  <li>submersibles e.g. submarines;</li>
  <li>aircushion vehicles e.g. hovercraft;</li>
  <li>hydrofoils; and</li>
  <li>amphibious vehicles.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not a full list of the exclusions. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/737/contents/made" rel="external">For a full list of exclusions please refer to the Regulations.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Obligations of manufacturers</h2>

<p>A manufacturer is a person who manufactures a product, or has a product designed or manufactured, and markets that product under their name or trademark.</p>

<p>The obligations of manufacturers of products include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before making a product available on the GB market or putting them into service, manufacturers must ensure that they have been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential requirements set out in Schedule 1 of the Regulations and that they do not endanger the health and safety of persons, property or the environment, when used correctly as intended.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must carry out the applicable conformity assessment procedure referred to in Part 3 of the Regulations. Schedule 15 to the Regulations introduced by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 sets out all the different types of conformity assessment procedures.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must also draw up the required technical documentation (Regulation 9 and Schedule 9). Once this has been done, a manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity in the model format set out in Schedule 4 (or for partly completed watercraft, in Schedule 3). The declaration must accompany the product when the product is placed on the GB market.</li>
  <li>The manufacturer must also put the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-2">see footnote 2</a> on the product or where applicable, a watercraft’s builder’s plate or propulsion engine (for components where it is not possible or warranted to affix the marking to the product, it can be affixed to its packaging and accompanying documentation).</li>
  <li>Until 31 December 2023 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-3">see footnote 3</a>, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to, or a document accompanying, the product. This must be done after a relevant conformity assessment procedure has been carried out; where an approved body has been involved in the conformity assessment procedure, the manufacturer must ensure that the UKCA marking is followed by the identification number of the approved body.</li>
  <li>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be placed on the GB market with the CE and CE UKNI conformity markings, see further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must draw up and keep the declaration of conformity up to date. The manufacturer must be able to provide the market surveillance authority with the relevant technical documentation for 10 years after the specific product was placed on the GB market.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must also label products (or, where in the case of components it is not possible, on accompanying documentation or packaging) with their name, registered trade name or registered trademark, their address, and the type batch or serial number (or other information identifying the manufacturer). This applies to all products.</li>
  <li>When placing products on the GB market, a manufacturer must ensure that they are accompanied by instructions and safety information in English.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must, when appropriate with regard to any risk posed to consumers, carry out sample testing of products they have placed on the market and investigate any complaints that the products are not in conformity with the relevant legal requirements in the Regulations and keep records of these complaints, as well as records of any products that are not in conformity and any products recalled.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must take action where they have reason to believe that any product is not in conformity with the Regulations (either to bring the product into conformity, withdraw it or recall it); where there is a risk to consumers they must inform the relevant market surveillance authority. In Great Britain this is local trading standards authorities. Manufacturers must take appropriate corrective action and co-operate with the enforcement authority.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers that require a manufacturer’s code (MIC) in relation to watercraft identification as set out in Schedule 1, 2.1 (3) must obtain one from <a class="govuk-link" href="http://britishmarine.co.uk/" rel="external">British Marine</a> who are authorised to issue MICs on behalf of the Secretary of State. Manufacturers who have a MIC from British Marine or the Secretary of State will not have to re-apply for a new code but can continue to use the code they have.</li>
</ol>

<p>Manufacturers based in Northern Ireland can follow the legislation as it applies to Northern Ireland and place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the GB market without any additional approvals. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Obligations of authorised representatives</h2>

<p>Manufacturers are able to appoint authorised representatives to perform certain tasks on their behalf.</p>

<p>Mandated authorised representatives for the GB market can be based in GB or Northern Ireland but cannot be based outside the UK. A manufacturer can only mandate an authorised representative established in the UK, under the 2017 Regulations as they apply in GB.</p>

<p>No GB-based authorised representatives are recognised under EU law. This means GB-based authorised representatives cannot carry out tasks on the manufacturer’s behalf for products being placed on the Northern Ireland and EEA markets. Therefore, a GB manufacturer selling products to the EEA or into Northern Ireland, who wishes to appoint an authorised representative to carry out tasks for them in respect of those products, must appoint an authorised representative established in Northern Ireland or the EEA.</p>

<p>An authorised representative must comply with all the duties imposed on the manufacturer under the 2017 Regulations that they are appointed by the manufacturer to perform. A manufacturer remains responsible for the proper performance of any obligations the authorised representative performs on their behalf.</p>

<p>Any references in the 2017 Regulations to the manufacturer are to be taken to include a reference to the authorised representative including in relation to penalties for failure to comply with those duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Obligations of importers</h2>

<p>An importer is a person or business based in the UK who places products on the GB market from a country outside the UK. This means that UK businesses which used to act as a ‘distributor’ before the end of the transition period legally become an ‘importer’ if they place products from an EEA country on the GB market.</p>

<p>This includes products that are supplied to NI businesses from the EEA and then placed on the GB market. In this instance the NI business will take on importer obligations for EEA-supplied goods that are placed on the GB market (see also Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods).</p>

<p>Importers have additional legal obligations which go beyond those of distributors, such as checking that manufacturers have carried out the required conformity assessment procedures and including their (the importer’s) name, registered trade name or mark and a postal address on the equipment.</p>

<p>Importers need to ensure that their address appears on the product or in accompanying documentation. Where it is not possible to indicate the information on a component, the importer can set out their details on the packaging or in accompanying documentation. To assist with the transition, the UK is applying a transitional period ending on 31 December 2022 to allow UK businesses who import from EEA states (and from 1 January 2021 become importers into the GB market) to provide their details on the accompanying documentation as an alternative to placing them on the product itself. This applies to goods that are not qualifying Northern Ireland goods. For further detail on qualifying Northern Ireland goods, please see Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Can you be contacted easily if there is a problem?</h3>

<p>A key principle underpinning product safety, for the benefit of consumers and regulators, is traceability of a product back to its source.</p>

<p>In recognition that under the new regulatory arrangements you may have the new status of an importer when placing products from an EEA state or Switzerland on the GB market, you are temporarily permitted when placing such products on the market (until 31 December 2022) to indicate your name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address in a document accompanying the product, instead of on the product itself. As set out above, this is usually only permitted for components where it is not possible to provide the specified information on the component itself. This additional temporary easement is permitted until 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-4">See footnote 4</a></p>

<p>We understand that there may be a period of adjustment to the new arrangements for importer documentation for the GB market, and it may be difficult to provide your details on documentation accompanying each and every individual product.</p>

<p>You may therefore use an alternative method where, for example, your contact information is on a document accompanying a batch of products. This document would then follow each batch of products through the distribution chain. Your contact details must follow each product through the distribution chain, but not necessarily by one document per product. Ultimately, the end user, each distributor (and a regulator) must be able to access the information.</p>

<p>Methods which enable traceability of the product after the initial batch has been broken up could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The importer address is present in shipping documents.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the invoice to the GB customer.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the label that is on the outer packaging (“shipper”) in which a number of finished goods is packed (normally customers will receive shippers unless the order is very small so that the shipper has to be opened and split).</li>
  <li>The importer address is included on the EU Declaration of Conformity and/or UK Declaration of Conformity (whichever is relevant for the product in question).</li>
</ul>

<p>You should work with your distributors to ensure physical documentation does accompany batches of product as far as possible, and in all cases that there are measures in place to ensure end users are able to identify the UK importer.</p>

<p>Alongside that, but not as an alternative, you can use your company website to provide more information, access to product details and contact points for retailers, consumers and enforcement bodies.</p>

<p>These options are for a time limited period only and may not be used after 31 December 2022. You are encouraged to put in place measures to ensure that individual items do carry the importer’s address where required ahead of this date.</p>
</div>

<p>The EU does not have any such transitional provision. In the absence of this, products being sold from GB to NI or the EU must be labelled with the NI or EU-based importer’s address.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recreational-craft-regulations-2017">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>The obligations of importers include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The importer must ensure that, the relevant conformity assessment has been carried out by the manufacturer; the manufacturer has drawn up the technical documentation; the product has the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-5">see footnote 5</a> (or until 31 December 2023 is affixed to a label on the product or on the accompanying documentation) and is accompanied by the required documents and that the manufacturer has complied with the labelling requirements imposed on the manufacturer.</li>
  <li>When an importer has reason to believe that a product to which the Regulations apply is not in conformity with the essential requirements, the importer must not place the product on the GB market.</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that when placing products on the GB market, that they are accompanied by instructions which are in English.</li>
  <li>The importer must provide their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address at which they can be contacted on the product. Where the product is a component and it is not possible to indicate this information on the component itself, the information may be provided in a document accompanying the component or on the component’s packaging. Where the importer has imported the product from an EEA state or Switzerland and places it on the GB market before 31 December 2022, the information may be provided in an accompanying document.</li>
  <li>The importer must, when appropriate and taking into account the risks to the health and safety of consumers, carry out testing of the products and investigate complaints about products that are not in conformity with the 2017 Regulations and keep a register of those complaints.</li>
  <li>The importer must take action where they have reason to believe that products that they have placed on the GB market are not in conformity with the 2017 Regulations. Where they are considered to present a risk to consumers then the importer is required to inform the market surveillance authority (Trading Standards in Great Britain).</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that when products are under their responsibility they are stored and transported under conditions that do not affect their conformity with the essential requirements.</li>
  <li>The importer must keep a copy of the relevant technical documentation and declaration of conformity for a period of 10 years after the products have been placed on the market and must co-operate with and provide information to the market surveillance authorities following any requests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may also be placed on the GB market. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Obligations of distributors</h2>

<p>UK businesses which were distributors of products within the EU single market should now consider whether they are importers from the EU single market and therefore what additional requirements they need to comply with – see section 6 above.</p>

<p>A distributor is any person, other than the manufacturer or importer, who makes a product available on the GB market.</p>

<p>The obligations of distributors include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before making available products on the GB market a distributor must take due care to ensure that they are in conformity with Part 2 of the Regulations, meaning that they comply with the essential requirements and that each economic operator has complied with their obligations in relation to them. If a distributor believes that a product is not in conformity with the essential requirements, the distributor must not make that product available on the GB market.</li>
  <li>The distributor must also verify that the products bear the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-6">see footnote 6</a> (or until 31 December 2023 it is affixed to a label or the accompanying documentation); are accompanied by the required documents, the instructions and safety information; and that the manufacturer and importer have complied with their labelling and identification requirements.</li>
  <li>The distributor must ensure that while products are under their responsibility, their storage and transport conditions do not jeopardise their conformity with the essential health and safety requirements.</li>
  <li>The distributor must take action where they have reason to believe that the products that they have made available on the GB market are not in conformity with the Regulations or which present a risk to consumers. They must inform the market surveillance authority and they must not make them available on the GB market until they meet the requirements of the Regulations.</li>
  <li>The distributor must also cooperate with and provide information to enforcing authorities following any requests.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Obligations of private importers</h2>

<p>A private importer is any natural or legal person (e.g. a company) established in the UK who imports in the course of a non-commercial activity a product from a country outside the UK with the intention of putting it into service for their own use.</p>

<p>The obligations of private importers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a private importer imports a product that has not previously been placed on the GB market, where the manufacturer has not carried out the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the private importer will have to carry out a post construction assessment to demonstrate conformity with the Regulations, as set out in Schedule 5.</li>
  <li>The private importer must ensure before putting recreational craft into service that it has been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential requirements.</li>
  <li>The private importer must ensure that the obligations for manufacturer covering technical documentation; declaration of conformity; relevant marking; instructions and safety information; provision of information and cooperation have been met or carried out.</li>
  <li>Where technical documentation is not available from the manufacturer, the private importer must have this drawn up using the appropriate expertise.</li>
  <li>The private importer must ensure that the name and postal address of the approved body that carried out the relevant conformity assessment procedure in relation to the product is marked on the craft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Transitional arrangements</h2>

<h3>Products placed on the market before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you placed an individual fully manufactured product on the EEA or the UK market (either in Northern Ireland or Great Britain) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to do anything new. These individual goods can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when there is a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other rights in the product. This does not require physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the EEA or UK market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Existing CE marked stock</h3>

<p>The UK will allow CE marked products that have been either self-declared as compliant (where permissible) or where compliance must and has been demonstrated through assessment by an EU-recognised conformity assessment body (notified body) to be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>Products lawfully placed on the market with a CE marking by 31 December 2022 can continue to circulate on the GB market after this date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> UKCA Marking</h2>

<h3>Assessment through third-party organisations:</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, products that are conformity assessed by a UK approved body should be UKCA marked, not CE marked. If the conformity assessment was carried out by a UK conformity assessment body and the CE marking was affixed to the fully made product before 1 January 2021, the CE marking can still be used but the product must be placed on the market before 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-7">See footnote 7</a></p>

<p>Where the product has been assessed by an EU Notified Body, manufacturers must continue to use the CE marking for products and can continue to place those products on the GB market until 31 December 2022. Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may be placed on the GB market after 31 December 2022. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<p>Rules around physically affixing the new UKCA marking mirror those which currently apply for the application of the CE marking although, until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to the product or a document accompanying the product, rather than being affixed to the product itself (even where it is otherwise possible to affix it to the product itself).</p>

<h3>Self-declaration:</h3>

<p>Where self-declaration of conformity is permitted by the Regulations, manufacturers placing products on the GB market can affix the new UKCA marking before placing a product on the GB market. Alternatively, until 31 December 2022, manufacturers can still affix the CE marking based on self-declaration of conformity, where permitted, before placing it on the GB market.</p>

<p>It is possible to affix both the UKCA marking and the CE marking to the same product on the basis of self-declaration, where permitted, as long as the EU and GB requirements remain the same. When selling to the EU or placing products on the NI market, the CE marking remains mandatory.</p>

<h3>Testing Certificates:</h3>

<p>Where conformity assessment is a 2-stage process, it is possible for products to have an EU-type-examination certification (1st stage) followed by a declaration by the manufacturer or third party of the production process under the responsibility of a UK approved body (2nd stage) until 31 December 2022. Such products should have the UKCA mark followed by the UK Approved Body Number.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods</h2>

<p>The government committed to providing unfettered access for qualifying Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK market after 1 January 2021. Recreational craft and personal watercraft that can be placed on the market in Northern Ireland in accordance with the legislation, as it applies to Northern Ireland, can be sold in the rest of the UK without any additional approvals.</p>

<p>This means that products that are qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be sold in the rest of the UK if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the CE marking is lawfully applied to the good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an EU-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the EU has a relevant mutual recognition agreement) and a CE marking is affixed</li>
  <li>the certificate of conformity previously held by a UK approved body has been transferred to an EU-recognised notified body and a CE marking has been affixed</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by a UK-based body, and the good is therefore marked with the CE marking and with the new UKNI marking</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be the case even if there are changes between the EU rules that the Northern Ireland Protocol applies to NI and the GB rules.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a></p>

<p>NI businesses that are importing products from the EEA and placing them on the GB market must ensure that the relevant conformity assessment procedure has been carried out, that the technical documentation has been drawn up and that the products bear the CE marking. They will also have to comply with the importer labelling duties (see Section 6 on obligations of importers).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Approved Bodies</h2>

<p>The UK has established a new framework for UK based bodies to assess products against GB rules. Existing UK notified bodies have been granted new UK ‘approved body’ status and are listed on a new UK database.</p>

<p>Approved bodies are conformity assessment bodies which have been approved by the Secretary of State to carry out the procedures for conformity assessment and certification for the GB market set out in the 2017 Regulations.</p>

<p>These approved bodies retain their 4-digit identification number. New approved bodies will be assigned a number by the Office for Product Safety and Standards on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Approved bodies can assess products for the GB market against GB essential requirements (which are, as yet, the same as EU essential requirements).</p>

<p>UK approved bodies must be established in the UK and be independent of the manufacturer. Approved bodies must examine the technical documentation and supporting evidence in respect of recreational craft to assess the adequacy of the technical design.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies">View the register of UK Approved Bodies</a></p>

<p>The register also contains details of bodies in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America, which the UK is designating as Approved Bodies through Mutual Recognition Agreements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Enforcement and penalties</h2>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>In Great Britain, the local weights and measures authorities (more commonly referred to as “Trading Standards”), are the market surveillance authorities responsible for enforcement of these Regulations.</p>

<p>The Regulations also provide powers to the Secretary of State or a person appointed to act on their behalf to enforce the Regulations and RAMS (Regulation (EC 765/2008), as amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which sets out requirements for market surveillance of products).</p>

<p>The Regulations provide the power for market surveillance authorities to take action against economic operators for products that are not in conformity with the Regulations or that present a risk. There are requirements on economic operators and private importers to co-operate with the enforcement authority as appropriate on request.</p>

<p>Market surveillance authorities (local trading standards authorities) must continue to have regard to the Regulators’ Code when developing the policies and operational procedures that guide their regulatory activities in this area. They should carry out their activities in a way that supports those they regulate to comply and grow, including choosing proportionate approaches that reflect risk.</p>

<p>In responding to non-compliance that they identify, regulators should clearly explain what the non-compliant item or activity is, the advice being given, actions required, or decisions taken, and the reasons for these. Unless immediate action is needed to prevent a serious breach, regulators should provide an opportunity for dialogue in relation to the advice, requirements or decisions, with a view to ensuring that they are acting in a way that is proportionate and consistent. The Secretary of State takes account of the provisions of both the Regulators’ Code and the Growth Duty in exercising his regulatory functions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Read the Regulators’ Code</a></p>

<p>The UK market surveillance authority will take all appropriate measures to withdraw from the market, to prohibit or restrict the supply of products which may endanger the health and safety of persons, property or the environment.</p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>A person committing an offence under the Regulations may be liable to a penalty. Penalties can include a fine or a prison sentence of up to three months for the most serious offences. It is matter for the enforcing authority to decide whether prosecution is appropriate in each case taking into account the circumstances of the case and the enforcement authorities’ own policies, operational procedures and practices in line with the Regulators’ Code. Should a prosecution take place, it is at the discretion of the court to decide the penalties imposed on the offender.</p>

<span class="number">14. </span> Glossary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Approved Body</strong> – A conformity assessment body which has been approved by the Secretary of State or was previously a UK ‘notified body’ before 1 January 2021.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Authorised Representative</strong> – A person appointed in writing by a manufacturer to perform specific tasks for the manufacturer. Manufacturers remain ultimately responsible for ensuring these tasks are carried out properly. From 1 January 2021, authorised representatives for the GB market must be based in the UK.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaration of conformity</strong> – A document prepared by the manufacturer which must detail, amongst other things, the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the specific product to which the declaration is referring</li>
      <li>the name and address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, their authorised representative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This must be kept by the manufacturer for a period of ten years from the date on which the product was placed on the GB market. This declaration must be made available to the enforcing authority upon request.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Distributor</strong> – Any person in the GB supply chain, other than the manufacturer or the importer, who makes products available on the GB market.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Market Surveillance Authority</strong> – In Great Britain, this is local trading standards authorities.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Importer</strong> – A person established in the UK who places a product from a country outside of the UK on the GB market. This includes a person based in NI who has been supplied with the product from an EEA country, who would, under NI law, be a distributor. A person who 1 January 2021 (under EU Rules) distributed recreational craft within the EU (including the UK) will now be an importer if they are bringing recreational craft into GB from another country (including EU Member States).</li>
  <li>
<strong>Manufacturer</strong> – A person who manufactures products or has a product designed or manufactured and markets those products under their name or trademark.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKCA Marking</strong> – The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is the new UK conformity marking used for certain goods (including recreational craft) being placed on the GB market, in place of the CE marking which is the conformity marking used in Northern Ireland and the European Union.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKNI Marking</strong> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) – The UKNI marking is a new marking applied in addition to the CE marking, where a good requiring mandatory third-party conformity assessment has been tested against EU requirements by a UK body. The UKNI marking applies when placing such products on the Northern Ireland market. Under the Government’s unfettered access commitments, products lawfully marked with the UKNI marking can also be placed on the GB market if they are also qualifying Northern Ireland goods.</li>
</ul>
