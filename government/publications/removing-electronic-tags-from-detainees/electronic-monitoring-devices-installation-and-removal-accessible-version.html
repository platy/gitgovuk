<h2>Instruction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1. This detention services order (DSO) provides instructions on the steps to be taken when individuals wearing, or in possession of, an electronic monitoring device enter an immigration removal centre (IRC), residential short-term holding facility (RSTHF) or pre-departure accommodation (<abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr>). References to “centre” in this document cover <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, STHFs and <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>2. Two separate Home Office teams operate in <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immigration Enforcement Compliance team (Compliance team)</li>
  <li>Immigration Enforcement Detention Engagement team (DET)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Compliance team are responsible for all on-site commercial and contract monitoring work. The <abbr title="immigration enforcement detention engagement teams">DETs</abbr> interact with detained individuals face-to-face within the <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, on behalf of responsible officers within the removal centres. They focus on communicating and engaging with people detained at <abbr title="immigration removal centres">IRCs</abbr>, helping them to understand their cases and reasons for detention.</p>

<p>There are no <abbr title="immigration enforcement detention engagement teams">DETs</abbr> at <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr>, functions which are the responsibility of the DET in <abbr title="residential short-term holding facilities">RSTHFs</abbr> are carried out by the supplier and overseen by the Escorting Contract Monitoring Team (ECMT). In the Gatwick <abbr title="pre-departure accommodation">PDA</abbr> the role of engagement with detained individuals is covered by the local Compliance team.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>3. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure that all electronic monitoring (<abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr>) devices are removed from detained individuals prior to removal from the UK, and to ensure such devices are removed when no longer permitted or required.</p>

<p>4. Immigration bail can be granted subject to an electronic monitoring condition under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 10 of the Immigration Act 2016.</p>

<p>5. Where <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> is a condition of bail individuals must be issued their <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> devices at the point of release from IRC (or prison) by the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier Field Monitoring Officer (FMO) working on behalf of the Home Office. The Detainee Custody Officer (<abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr>) will escort the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier to the area in which they will be performing <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> device installation (for example legal visits).</p>

<h3>Procedures</h3>

<p>6. The following GPS monitoring devices are being introduced:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fitted devices (ankle tags) with a Home Office issued mobile phone (low specification, without camera or Wi-Fi technology).</li>
  <li>Non-fitted devices, which are detachable but will require the person to submit daily biometric data verification at random intervals. This may be issued in rare circumstances where an ankle tag is deemed unsuitable due to vulnerability factors (where the device is available).</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> device issue (by <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier)</h4>

<p>7. The Home Office appointed <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier will attend the IRC and issue <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> devices to detained individuals upon their release. In the vast majority of cases an ankle tag will be fitted and a low specification mobile phone issued to the detained individual.</p>

<p>8. The <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> installation appointments are scheduled and overseen by the Home Office <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub (part of FNO Returns Command, Borders &amp; Enforcement). The <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub identify an appropriate date and time for <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> induction upon release, schedule the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier, and notify the relevant DET by sending necessary bail/release paperwork for service in advance. The <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub will endeavour to provide 48 hours’ notice when scheduling <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> induction appointments.</p>

<p>9. The <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier will access the IRC on foot, bringing with them their approved equipment as specified in the inventory. The <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier will comply with local IRC entry procedures and undergo all necessary searching procedures on arrival, before being escorted by IRC <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> to the area where they will issue devices (for example legal visits).</p>

<p>10. Prior to <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> device issue, the detained individual must already have been informed of their release, served their immigration bail paperwork, and their immigration bail conditions explained to them by the local DET. After which, the detained individual should be presented to the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier by the <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>11. Where the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier is delayed without explanation for a scheduled <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> appointment, or the appointment time slot may be missed, or the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier cannot attend altogether, DCOs should contact the Home Office <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub urgently by telephone. The Home Office <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub will liaise with the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier and decide next steps. An urgent situation may on occasion require IRC DCOs to contact the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier directly. Contact details for the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Hub and <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> supplier will be held by the IRC supplier reception managers.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> device removal</h4>

<p>12. Occasionally, DCOs and other centre staff may encounter detained individuals still wearing a fitted device (tag) on the ankle, or in possession of a non-fitted device when the individual enters detention. A detained individual wearing a tag should also be in possession of the Home Office mobile phone. The non-fitted device and phone may already be in a detained individual’s property and efforts to identify and retrieve these should be made.</p>

<p>13. DCOs must ensure that any electronic devices are identified and removed from detained individuals at the point of reception into a centre.</p>

<p>14. The correct way to remove an electronic tag and the process for returning the tag to the appropriate contractor is as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the tag from the detained individual’s ankle by making a single cut across the thin strap at the mid-point, so that the ends are still attached to the tag itself. This must be done with care to ensure the detained individual or the person removing the tag is not accidentally injured. A pair of safety scissors is the ideal tool for the situation.</li>
  <li>Having established that a Home Office mobile phone is in the tagged detained individual’s possession (sealed property bag), the <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> must remove the device from the property bag ensuring that property procedures are followed correctly: any broken seals and new sealed bags created must be recorded appropriately on relevant document records (e.g. Person Escort Record) and internal systems such as CID.</li>
  <li>For a non-fitted device, where it is established that this is in the individual’s sealed property, the <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> must carefully remove ensuring that property and seal procedures are followed correctly as above.</li>
  <li>Once an ankle tag, non-fitted device or mobile phone is removed, DCOs must immediately record the device serial number against the detained individual’s personal information on the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Device Uninstall document (see Annex A).</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> should complete the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Device Uninstall document which captures details of any ankle tag, mobile phone, or non-fitted device removed: serial number, date, time, location of removal, <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> name who removed, person <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> devices removed from, Home Office reference numbers. This can be done electronically or manually on a printed copy. Please see Annex A for the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Device Uninstall document.</li>
  <li>Once completed, the <abbr title="detainee custody officer">DCO</abbr> should email a copy of the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Device Uninstall document to the Home Office <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Service Delivery Team, whose email address can be found via your on-site DET or IRC Reception Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>15. Once removed, the devices should be placed in a sealed security (cash valuable) bag with a copy of the completed <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Device Uninstall document. The security bag should be placed in an envelope with a printed label on it to be returned via freepost to the <abbr title="electronic monitoring">EM</abbr> Supplier at ‘FREEPOST, EMS Stores’ and posted as soon as possible to ensure devices may be cleaned and recirculated for use swiftly.</p>

<p>16. The removal of the devices must be recorded within the Detainee Transferable Document (DTD) in accordance with DSO 01/2019 Detainee escort records. DCOs should save a copy of the Home Office Device Uninstall document to the DTD, individual’s detention file, and the supplier’s local information management system.</p>

<p>17. The onsite Compliance team and DET at the centre should be notified via Part C by the supplier once the monitoring device (tag or non-fitted device ) or Home Office mobile phone is removed, the DET will then update ATLAS and the Case Information Database (CID) with the details provided.</p>
