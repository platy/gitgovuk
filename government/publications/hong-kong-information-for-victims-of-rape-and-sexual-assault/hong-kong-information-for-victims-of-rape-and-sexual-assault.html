<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the emergency number on [999]</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the British Consulate on +852 2901 3000, staff will be empathetic and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-consulate-general-hong-kong">British Consulate-General in Hong Kong</a></p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. You can also contact the British Consulate on +852 2901 3000, we will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the phone 24/7.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the British Consulate and we can offer you consular support.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</p>

<p>You can request to speak to either a male or female police officer and police would most likely to abide. There will be English speaking officers at the station, if not, police will arrange for an English speaking officer or arrange an interpreter to take statement.</p>

<p>The investigation steps are: statement taking, physical evidence, crime scene investigation, forensic examination and identification parade.</p>

<p>If you require medical attention, the police will immediately arrange for an ambulance to take you to the nearest public hospital.</p>

<p>You may be accompanied by any person(s) of your choice throughout the police investigation, provided that no unnecessary hindrance is caused.</p>

<p>You will be introduced to support services provided by NGOs. They are available round-the-clock to provide immediate intervention and support services to victims.</p>

<p>The consular staff can accompany you to the police to give support where timing and location allow and if you wish us to be presented.</p>

<p>You will not normally ask to surrender your passport whilst any investigation is carried out.</p>

<p>Lawyer will not be assigned to the victim, but you may instruct private lawyer to get advice about legal process. The Department of Justice of Hong Kong is responsible for the conduct of criminal prosecutions, and public prosecutors handle all matters for prosecuting trials and appeals at all levels of the criminal courts.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>The British Consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>We can provide you with lists of English-speaking <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-medical-facilities">medical facilities</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hong-kong-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators</a>.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital. If you wish, and depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you donât report it, your case may not be investigated.</p>

<p>There is an option to report crime via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.erc.police.gov.hk/cmiserc/CCC/PolicePublicPage?language=en" rel="external">e-Report Centre of Hong Kong Police</a>. However, if there is lack of forensic or crime scene evidence, police may not investigate.</p>

<p>If the victim does not report the crime, they will still be able to get medical attention at Accident &amp; Emergency (A&amp;E) of major public hospitals in Hong Kong. Public hospitals in Hong Kong provide low costs medical treatment for Hong Kong residents. For visitors without Hong Kong identity cards, they are charged at non-eligible person fee. See details: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?Parent_ID=10044&amp;Content_ID=10045&amp;Ver=HTML" rel="external">https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?Parent_ID=10044&amp;Content_ID=10045&amp;Ver=HTML</a></p>

<p>There are two non-government organisations in Hong Kong offer specialised support for victim of sexual crime. The designated social workers will provide immediate support and follow-up service such as emotional support and counselling to the victim. They will accompany victim to go through all necessary procedures like reporting to the police, receiving medical treatment and forensic examination.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ceasecrisis.tungwahcsd.org/document/pamphlet_eng.pdf" rel="external">Tung Wah Group hospital CEASE Crisis Centre</a>: 24/7 hotline 18281</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://rainlily.org.hk/eng/home" rel="external">RainLily</a>: 852 2375 5322</p>

<p>Forensic examination can only be done if the crime is reported to police.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest British embassy, high commission or consulate, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.<br></p>

<p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Hong Kong: what happens next?</h2>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, texts and social media messages.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>Insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</p>

<p>As soon as a report is made, you will be invited to give a statement and recount what had happened to you.</p>

<p>Statements from persons under age of 17 and mental incapacitated will be taken in the form of video recorded interview. Interpreter for languages or disability needs will be arranged if required.</p>

<p>Your clothing may be taken as evidence and any items that may be of evidential value to facilitate the investigation.</p>

<p>Police will collect evidence from the scene and you may be invited to return to the scene with the police to assist in the investigation.</p>

<p>You may be invited to participate in a forensic examination, a forensic pathologist may take body samples from you, examine your wounds and intimate parts.</p>

<p>If an identification parade is arranged, you may be invited to identity the person (The suspects will not be able to see you during the parade).</p>

<p>After the report to the police, you will be provided with the case number, the name, rank and contact information of the officer-in-charge of your case for your access to the investigation progress.</p>

<p>Hong Kong police will not normally inform the UK police, unless you report the incident with the UK police and UK police request assistance from the local police. It is not the usual procedure for local police to run UK police check on victim. However, any criminal conviction you have, by law, must be divulged to the defence.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>Accident &amp; Emergency (A&amp;E) of major public hospitals in Hong Kong can treat victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

<p>Medical staff will carry out the examination, you can ask for the same sex medical staff to do the examination.</p>

<p>Hospital will not automatically report the results of any examination to the police if the case has not be reported to police and if the victim is an adult (over 18). However, medical staff are instructed to encourage victim to report the case to police, and they will usually refer victim to the social worker at hospital where appropriate advice will be given.</p>

<p>If the crime is not reported to police, hospital will still provide necessary treatment for rape victim i.e. immediate medical examination / treatment including pregnancy prevention and screening of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>Medical follow-up such as treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, gynaecological treatment and HIV etc. Only if the crime is reported to police, will forensic examination be given and photo may be taken for evidence.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>Hospital medical staff in Hong Kong can give advice and prescribe on HIV PEP medication (Post-exposure prophylaxis, a treatment that can prevent HIV infection).</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK</p>

<p>Accident &amp; Emergency (A&amp;E) at the public hospital will provide emergency contraception to victim. For the morning-after pill, customer can be obtained from clinics of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.famplan.org.hk/en" rel="external">Family Planning Association</a>, family doctors and government clinics, but not over the pharmacy counters.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.</p>

<p>Public hospitals in Hong Kong provide low costs medical treatment for Hong Kong residents. For visitors without Hong Kong identity cards, they are charged at non-eligible person fee. See details: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?Parent_ID=10044&amp;Content_ID=10045&amp;Ver=HTML" rel="external">https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_index.asp?Parent_ID=10044&amp;Content_ID=10045&amp;Ver=HTML</a>.</p>

<p>For patients under police care, i.e. victim of crimes, in general the Hospital Authority will waive the A&amp;E charges incurred at the request of police.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Hong Kong: what to expect</h2>

<p>Police will invite you to give a statement and recount what had happened to you. Officer of the same gender will conduct the interview at your request.</p>

<p>You may be invited to return to the scene with the police.</p>

<p>You may be invited to participate in a forensic examination, a forensic pathologist may take body samples from you, examine your wounds and intimate parts.</p>

<p>If an identification parade is arranged, you may be invited to identity the person (The suspects will not be able to see you during the parade).</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, case will be referred to Prosecutions Division of the Hong Kong Department of Justice and decision will be made on whether or not to bring criminal proceedings. However, it usually takes months for case to go to trial.</p>

<p>The victim has the right to request of any written statement made to police (or video tape recording of the interview), be given contact number of the case officer, be informed of police and court procedures, and be informed of the progress and result of the investigation.</p>

<p>You can appoint private lawyer to secure appropriate legal guidance and to accompany you to make police statement, and to promote your interest with police and the court. You can choose a lawyer from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lawdirectory.hklawsoc.org.hk/en/Search-for-a-Law-Firm" rel="external">Hong Kong Law Society webpage</a>.</p>

<p>The public prosecutor from the Department of Justice is responsible for prosecuting the case and his role is to present the evidence fairly at trials.</p>

<p>The victim is allowed to leave the country once the case is filed.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>The victim will be expected to testify in court when call upon by the public prosecutor or the defendant legal team. Although, witness testimony via video conference may be applied, the court may not find it appropriate to allow video conference or such application will be strongly opposed by the other party. Victim will therefore be expected to return to the country.</p>

<p>If the victim does have to attend trial, the Hong Kong authorities may assist with travel and accommodation arrangements.</p>

<p>Victims will be provided with the crime report reference number, the name and contact number of the officer in charge of the case. Victims have the right to request information regarding investigation and legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Victims can request to the officer-in-charge to arrange support from trained volunteers and social workers to provide emotional support and practical assistance to witness during trial.</p>

<p>The victims has the right to be heard and the office-in-charge and the prosecuting counsel shall bring to the attention of the court the victimâs circumstance and views.</p>

<p>Once the case has been submitted to public prosecution, the prosecutor will consider admissible evidence available is sufficient to justify instituting proceeding and that the general public interest must require that the prosecution be conducted. If the victim wishes to withdraw the charge, the admissible evidence cannot be corroborated and the prosecutor will consider whether it is possible to continue without the victimâs evidence and if so whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. However, police may charge the victim for waste of police time or give false statement.</p>

<p>The alleged assailant can press counter charges claiming false accusations.</p>

<p>Hong Kong courts can order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, after they have been convicted in a criminal court and as a result of civil action.</p>

<p>There is a state-funded compensation scheme (Criminal and Law Enforcement Injuries Compensation (CLEIC) to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime, which may apply to foreign nationals having the right to remain in Hong Kong or being permitted to remain in Hong Kong under the Immigration Ordinance. Find our more from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/04_crime_matters/cvc.html" rel="external">Hong Kong Police Force website</a>.</p>
