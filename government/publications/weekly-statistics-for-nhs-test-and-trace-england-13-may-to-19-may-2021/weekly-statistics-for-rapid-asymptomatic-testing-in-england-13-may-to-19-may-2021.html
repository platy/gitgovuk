<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This statistical publication provides information on rapid testing for people without COVID-19 symptoms in England. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by test result</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted education settings</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care homes</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by NHS staff</li>
</ul>

<p>This publication focuses on rapid testing using lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests, however polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests are included where appropriate, either for comparison or where regular asymptomatic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing is used. All data used in the report can be found in the ‘Tests conducted’ data tables on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weekly-statistics-for-nhs-test-and-trace-england-13-may-to-19-may-2021" class="govuk-link">weekly collection page</a>. This includes information on both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at lower-tier local authority level.</p>

<p>The data in this release can be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>determine the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace in the expansion of rapid asymptomatic testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor the levels of testing and positive test results amongst various settings such as in education, care homes and by NHS staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data should not be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>calculate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the wider population</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>calculate case positivity rates, the reasons for which are explained in the <a href="#about-this-data" class="govuk-link">About this data</a> section below</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assess the effectiveness of the testing types used in England</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compare the mass testing programmes across nations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> case positivity rates are published within <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports" class="govuk-link">National flu and COVID-19 surveillance reports</a> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positivity rates are also published on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>The figures in this report include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which were registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. They also now include the number of tests reported by secondary care NHS staff which were registered via a different route. They do not currently include a relatively small number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted within private sector testing.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#about-this-data" class="govuk-link">About this data</a> section below for more information.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Types of tests</h3>

<h4>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests check for the genetic material of the coronavirus in the sample, which is taken using a swab and is processed in a lab via a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>). This type of test is predominantly used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for anyone who has symptoms</li>
  <li>to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result</li>
  <li>for regular asymptomatic testing in social care</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lateral flow device tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, often referred to as rapid tests, test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used for those who do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>From 21 October 2020, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were made available in limited capacity except where rapid testing pilots were conducted. Since then their availability has expanded, initially to a broader range of settings and from 9 April 2021 to everyone in England.</p>

<p>Prior to 27 January 2021, if an individual received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result, they were routinely asked to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to confirm this. Between 27 January and 29 March 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was temporarily suspended, except for those self-reporting their test result and for some other use cases such as testing for cross-channel hauliers. From 30 March 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, taking into account the lower prevalence of COVID-19 and the benefits of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for detecting variants of concern.</p>

<h3>Rapid testing for people without symptoms</h3>

<p>Rapid testing using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests is currently being offered to people who do not have symptoms, in a range of different settings such as education providers, care homes and workplaces. In addition, anyone in England can now obtain <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests for the purposes of regular asymptomatic testing; see <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/" class="govuk-link">regular rapid coronavirus tests if you do not have symptoms</a> guidance for more information.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is carried out at asymptomatic test sites, in a range of settings such as universities, schools, care homes and workplaces. They are also set up by local authorities as part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-testing-explainer/community-testing-a-guide-for-local-delivery#how-the-community-testing-programme-works" class="govuk-link">community testing programme</a>. Testing at these sites is assisted: a person will take a swab test under the supervision of a trained operator who then processes the test and reads and records the result.</p>

<p>Most <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is now carried out entirely by individuals themselves (that is an individual takes their own test, unassisted, and reports their own result). For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-lateral-flow-antigen-testing-for-people-without-symptoms" class="govuk-link">understanding lateral flow tests for people without symptoms</a>.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted, England<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</h2>

<p>Between 18 February and 17 March 2021, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and reported rose sharply, peaking at just over 7.6 million, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. Following that peak, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and reported reduced sharply in the week commencing 1 April, to just over 4 million. The reduction coincided with the end of spring term in schools.</p>

<p>Between 8 April and 21 April, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests increased following the start of summer term and the introduction of universal testing. Since then, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted has decreased for 3 successive weeks to 4,883,048 tests in the latest week (13 May to 19 May 2021).</p>

<p>In comparison, 974,421 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were conducted in the latest week (13 May to 19 May 2021). The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted continues to be lower than the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted. This reflects the increasing use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, as well as a decrease in symptomatic people taking a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test due to decreasing COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have different uses and are therefore applied in different situations (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-tests">Types of tests</a> section above for more information). The primary purpose of rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is to identify people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms. As the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted increases, more asymptomatic positive cases are identified earlier and therefore they are less likely to transmit the virus to their contacts.</p>

<p>Of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and reported in the latest week (13 May to 19 May 2021), 5,426 tests returned a positive result, a decrease from previous week (6 May to 12 May 2021), and in the same period 4,872,579 tests returned a negative result, a decrease from 5,069,972 tests in the previous week. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were introduced, 169,624 positive results and 78,654,273 negative results have been reported.</p>

<p>This data can be found in the ‘table_1’ and ‘table_3’ tabs of the ‘Tests conducted: 28 May 2020 to 19 May 2021 data tables’ on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weekly-statistics-for-nhs-test-and-trace-england-13-may-to-19-may-2021" class="govuk-link">weekly collection page</a>.</p>

<h4>The total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted does not include tests taken by staff in NHS trusts as they report via a different route.</h4>

<p>The total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and reported does not include tests taken by staff in NHS trusts as they report via a different route. These figures are reported separately in the section for tests conducted by staff in NHS trusts and have an additional week’s time lag (because they are collated weekly by trusts). The data therefore cannot be combined on a weekly basis to give an overall total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted.</p>

<p>*Students in this time period only included children of critical workers and those in vulnerable groups who were currently attending school.</p>

<p>Between 27 January and 30 March 2021, staff, students, household bubbles and support bubbles who tested positive after using a home <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test kit were required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, and those who tested positive from an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test taken at an on-site test centre did not. From 30 March 2021, the requirement to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. For more information on the testing methods for the different phases of education see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by phase of education</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted within primary schools and nurseries increased to peak at over 1 million in the week beginning 18 March 2021. In the latest week, the number of tests conducted has decreased to 707,299 compared to 827,025 tests in the previous week. 559 positive test results were returned in the latest week within primary schools and nurseries, a decrease from 758 positive results in the previous week.</p>

<p>Similarly, within secondary schools and colleges, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted increased steeply to over 5.7 million in the week beginning 11 March which coincided with the return to schools. In the latest week (13 May to 19 May 2021), the number of tests has decreased to 1,635,568 compared to 1,904,377 in the previous week. This follows an increase in tests in week ending 21 April which coincided with the start of the summer term for schools. Since then, the number of positive test results has decreased to 1,586 positive results in the latest week.</p>

<p>The total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken in secondary schools and colleges includes tests not registered. The full breakdown of tests registered and not registered in secondary schools and colleges is available in ‘table 6’ of the ‘Tests conducted: 28 May 2020 to 19 May 2021 data tables’ on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weekly-statistics-for-nhs-test-and-trace-england-13-may-to-19-may-2021" class="govuk-link">weekly collection page</a>.</p>

<p>From the week beginning 8 April 2021, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test conducted in higher education has remained stable and has not peaked over 75,000 tests.</p>

<p>In the latest week (13 May to 19 May 2021) 51,734 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted in higher education, which is a decrease from 55,440 tests in the previous week. There has been a decrease in positive results in higher education in the latest week, with 29 positive test results returned.</p>

<h4>The number of positive test results is not published as a proportion of the total tests conducted due to the data quality. In addition, because there are differences in the testing operation between the different phases of education, they cannot be directly compared. See the <a href="#data-quality" class="govuk-link">Data quality</a> section below for more information.</h4>

<p>This data can be found in the ‘table_6’ tab of the ‘Tests conducted: 28 May 2020 to 19 May 2021 data tables’ on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/weekly-statistics-for-nhs-test-and-trace-england-13-may-to-19-may-2021" class="govuk-link">weekly collection page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by secondary school students</h3>

<p>Upon their return to school from 8 March, secondary school students were tested for COVID-19 at school-specific asymptomatic test sites (assisted), with each student asked to take 3 tests spaced 3 to 5 days apart. Those students who received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result were not asked to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. After these first 3 tests, students begin twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing at home (self-reported), for which they are advised to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 2 days if they receive a positive result.</p>

<p>In the latest week ending 19 May, 1,018,020 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were taken by students in secondary schools which is a decrease from 1,164,543 tests in the previous week. Of these, 27,138 tests were assisted at a test site and 990,882 tests were self-reported.</p>

<p>In the latest week ending 19 May, 1,090 positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were received by secondary school students, of which 14 were assisted at a test site and 1,076 were self-reported<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. Of those which were self-reported, 623 were matched to a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> and 419 received a subsequent positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, the remaining 204 were negative or void. These figures therefore show that in the latest week 67% of positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests which could be matched to a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, subsequently received a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result. The remaining 33% were negative or void, however there are multiple reasons why an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result and a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result might differ, these are listed in the section below.</p>

<h4>Figures for confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests taken by secondary school students after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result at an asymptomatic test site (assisted) are also published in the accompanying data tables.</h4>

<p>These figures show the number of positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests declining as secondary school students moved to self-reporting their <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests after their first 3 tests on site on their return to school. The requirement for an individual to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests from 30 March 2021. Therefore, the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> data for those assisted <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken at asymptomatic test sites cannot be directly compared across the full time period or to those taken at home before 30 March 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>There are a number of possible reasons why the results of the initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> may be different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>issues in correctly reading or recording the result for LFDs, leading to reporting a positive result when it was negative</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> may have incorrectly returned a positive result, which occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> may have incorrectly returned a negative result which can occur if the sampling technique was poor. See more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gos-impact-of-false-positives-and-negatives-3-june-2020">false negatives in <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time delay between the taking of the 2 tests means that it is possible for an individual to have correctly tested positive when they took the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and then correctly negative when they took the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. Of all the confirmatory PCRs identified for self-reported LFDs, 85% were taken within one day of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test meaning this is unlikely to be the reason for the negative confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The data presented here is in line with previously published analysis by NHS Test and Trace <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lateral-flow-device-specificity-in-phase-4-post-marketing-surveillance">on lateral flow device specificity</a>, which shows <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have a specificity of at least 99.9%. This means that for every 1,000 lateral flow tests carried out, there is fewer than one false positive result. The number of false positives as a proportion of all positive results varies depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 within the populations being tested – the higher the level of prevalence, the lower the probability that a positive result will be a false positive. For more technical information on <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and false positives see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by staff, students, household bubbles and support bubbles</h3>

<p>In the latest week 349,588 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were taken by staff in secondary schools, a decrease from the previous week. In comparison, 589,068 tests were taken by staff in primary schools and nurseries.</p>

<p>201,464 tests were taken by individuals that belong to a household bubble of a student or staff member at school or nursery and 25,944 were taken by individuals in their support bubbles. The number of tests conducted by household and support bubbles decreased in comparison to the previous week.</p>

<h2>Tests conducted and registered to care home settings, England</h2>

<p>Asymptomatic testing, using both rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests has been rolled out differently across different care home settings and their residents, staff and visitors, as summarised in the table below.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care homes includes staff, residents and visitors tested via test kits directly sent to the care home which were registered. It will not include care home staff, residents, or visitors who are tested via a different route, for example at a regional or local test Site or a mobile testing unit or tests that were not registered.</p>

<p>*Close contact visits with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing began on 2 December 2020 but ceased on 6 January 2021 because of the national lockdown. Throughout the period of national restrictions, visits were limited to outdoors, in visiting pods, or with a substantial screen; as well as those in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<p>DHSC also publishes care home testing data in the monthly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-may-2021" class="govuk-link">adult social care in England statistics</a>. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes therefore differences in the figures will occur, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and registered to care home settings, England</h3>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted within care homes increased overall from 40,000 tests in the week commencing 25 June 2020 to over 590,000 tests in the week commencing 7 January 2021. There has been a decrease in the latest week (13 May to 19 May) to 453,262, from 494,075 in the previous week (6 May to 12 May).</p>

<p>Over the past 3 months the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted within care homes has stayed between 490,000 and 570,000, while the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted has remained between 400,000 and 500,000. In the latest week (13 May to 19 May) 532,320 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted and registered to care homes, a decrease from 535,329 tests compared to the previous week (6 May to 12 May).</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted continues to be higher than the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. Previously the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted had always been higher than <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. This reflects the increasing use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, as well as a decrease in symptomatic people taking a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test due to decreasing COVID-19 prevalence.</p>

<p>Of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the latest week (13 May to 19 May), 338 tests returned a positive result, and 531,853 tests returned a negative result. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were introduced, 23,611 positive results and 9,952,487 negative results have been reported.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by staff in care homes has decreased to 440,278 tests in the latest week from 446,843 tests in the previous week. Of these, 278 returned a positive result compared to 351 in the previous week.</p>

<p>Between 13 May and 19 May, 7,913 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were conducted by care home residents, which has increased from 7,230 in the previous week. Of these, 8 returned a positive result, the same as the previous week.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by NHS staff, England</h2>

<p>Rapid asymptomatic testing by NHS staff began in November 2020 and has since expanded to include the following groups. All positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results in the NHS are followed up with a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and contact tracing activities are trigged by the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result.</p>

<p>Staff in primary care and those in the independent sector delivering NHS services self-report their test result through the Test and Trace GOV.UK portal, whereas staff in NHS trusts report their results to their employer. The NHS trust then submits data for their staff to NHS Digital (formerly to PHE) which is separate to reporting through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. This separate reporting system was established this way because NHS secondary care providers began testing with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>’s before an NHS Digital reporting solution for trusts was built. Because of this, the figures for NHS trusts are not included in the national figures for the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted reported via this route. We report them separately here.</p>

<p>Staff in NHS trusts and services are able to access additional forms of testing along with lateral flow testing, including asymptomatic testing with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr> (loop-mediated isothermal amplification). NHS staff testing via these additional methods are not included in these figures.</p>

<h4>The number of positive test results received by NHS staff is not published as a proportion of the total tests conducted because individuals test repeatedly and therefore cannot be compared with other testing regimes. See the ‘data quality’ section for more information.</h4>

<p>For more information see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by NHS primary care staff</h3>

<p>Primary care services provide the first point of contact in the healthcare system, acting as the ‘front door’ of the NHS. Primary care includes general practice, community pharmacy, dental and optometry (eye health) services.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by primary care staff peaked at nearly 170,000 at the start of February and has been decreasing overall since then. In the latest week, 114,713 <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were reported by NHS primary care staff which has decreased from 117,346 in the previous week. 54 positive test results were returned in the latest week by NHS primary care staff, a decrease from 64 positive results in the previous week. Since <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing for primary care staff began, there have been a total of 2,633 positive test results.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by staff in NHS trusts</h3>

<p>NHS trusts include acute and specialist hospitals, community, mental health and learning disability and ambulance services. Staff in NHS trusts report their test results via their employer, which is separate to reporting through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. These tests are therefore not included in the total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted reported earlier in the bulletin.</p>

<p>The timing of the weekly process of submission by NHS trusts means that data for the latest week is not available. Figures for tests conducted by staff in NHS trusts are therefore published with an additional week’s lag in comparison to the rest of the data in this publication. For more information see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a></p>

<p>Since the week ending 21 April 2021, the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by staff in NHS trusts has steadily declined from 414,487 to 360,408 tests in the latest week ending 12 May. Of the tests reported during the latest week, 173 tests were positive which continues the decline in positive test results seen over the past 4 months.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by other NHS staff (including the independent sector)</h3>

<p>The majority of tests reported by other NHS staff, include members of staff working in the independent sector who have also had access to twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing. In the latest week ending 19 May, 20,144 tests were conducted by other NHS employees which is an increase from 19,708 tests in the previous week and 24 positive test results were received.</p>

<p>Within the NHS the majority of staff work in NHS trusts, followed by primary care and then the independent sector, hence testing volumes will reflect the number of staff working in each setting.</p>

<h2>About this data</h2>

<p>Lateral flow device tests were first made available from 21 October 2020 in England. This data contains <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route that is used to collect data for this report.</p>

<p>The following use cases for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not currently reporting results digitally into Test and Trace systems, and therefore are excluded from this report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing for some staff in private sector industries</li>
  <li>testing for some hauliers, these are published separately see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/haulier-coronavirus-testing">haulier coronavirus testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, test results should be reported directly into Public Health England. In future, all <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests will be reported via the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and will be included.</p>

<p>A full explanation of the data sources and methods used to produce these statistics can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

<p>Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be open and transparent with the public it serves, this data is being released at the earliest possible opportunity. However, this data should be treated with caution whilst the understanding of the data and its quality improves.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test produces a result on the device almost immediately, without it being automatically recorded, therefore some results might not be captured. For settings where self-reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing procedures<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> are in place, it is likely that the number of tests conducted are underreported. It is however their statutory duty to do so, and easier reporting tools are being rolled out to support these individuals to report their tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is possible that tests with a negative result are more likely to be affected, therefore it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with the data.</p>

<p>Positive test results are not published as a proportion of the total number of tests conducted. There are several reasons why it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with this data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of tests conducted is not deduplicated and refers to the number of tests taken and not the number of people tested. Because people can have more than one test, the number of tests conducted therefore cannot be compared with prevalence or case positivity rates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing is primarily used for repeat testing of asymptomatic individuals and the frequency of testing varies across different settings, therefore positivity rates would not be directly comparable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the potential underreporting of tests conducted by individuals self-reporting is more likely to affect negative test results than positives thus skewing any positivity rate calculation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More information on data limitations and how the figures in this publication can and cannot be used is outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h3>Future developments</h3>

<p>We continue to explore the feasibility of adding new breakdowns to the publication on rapid testing to support user needs. Over the coming months, we intend to make data available on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>rapid testing in public and private industries</p>
