<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>England Woodland Creation Offer Application Form top tips</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Over the coming weeks we’ll be sharing some advice on how you should complete the EWCO Application Form so that we have all the information we need to process your application.</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Tip 4: Things you must include on your EWCO application maps</p>

<ul>
  <li>All the land on which the woodland creation works and items are proposed must be shown</li>
  <li>A clearly marked boundary using a coloured line encompassing the entire application area</li>
  <li>All work types shown using coloured lines or shaded/hatched areas, use a legend</li>
  <li>Proposed areas of open space within the planting areas</li>
  <li>The Single Business Identifier (SBI) and Property or site name</li>
  <li>The map number and the total number of maps, an overview map is needed if you use more than one map</li>
  <li>A six figure OS grid reference for the centre of the map (or OS grid lines)</li>
</ul>

<p>Base maps can be requested from the Forestry Commission through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/request-a-map-from-the-forestry-commission">Map Request Service</a> for use in your application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>New plant health requirements introduced following further findings of the tree pathogen Phytophthora pluvialis to combat further spread</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Find out what we are doing.</h3>

<p>Phytophthora pluvialis is a fungus-like pathogen known to affect a variety of tree species, including western hemlock, Douglas fir, tanoak and several pine species (in particular radiata pine). It is reported to cause needle cast (where needles turn brown and fall off), shoot dieback, and lesions on the stem, branches, and roots.</p>

<p>Extensions to the existing demarcated area in Devon and Cornwall have been made following further identifications of the pathogen in these areas. A new demarcated area has been introduced following the identification of the pathogen in woodlands in Surrey, and following further findings in Wales, a new demarcated area has been introduced in Gloucestershire to combat any potential spread.</p>

<p>The introduction and extensions of demarcated areas helps to prevent the accidental movement of tree pathogens. The Notices for introducing the demarcated area in Gloucestershire and Surrey, and extending the demarcated area in Devon and Cornwall, all come into force on Thursday 21 April. You can read about these changes and see the demarcated areas on our GOV.UK page: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phytophthora-pluvialis">Phytophthora pluvialis</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve also published a blog on our work on Phytophthora pluvalis; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/04/14/behind-the-scenes-at-the-forestry-commission-managing-the-outbreak-of-phytophthora-pluvialis/" rel="external">‘Behind the Scenes’ at the Forestry Commission: Managing the outbreak of Phytophthora pluvialis</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Ips typographus and the risk as we approach warmer weather: action required</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Remain vigilant.</h3>

<p>All landowners, managers and timber processors should remain vigilant for Ips typographus, and it is important to take the necessary action now, to rapidly remove any storm damaged trees in their area.</p>

<p>With significant storm damage reported across the South East of England during the winter, spruce trees that have fallen or snapped in the storms significantly increase the chances of an establishment of Ips typographus occurring this spring/summer if another flight occurs from the continent. We recommend that spruce continue to be walked, with fallen or snapped trees identified and destroyed where possible.</p>

<p>Any woodland owner, manager or timber processor in the demarcated areas, need to get authorisation for removal of damaged trees for more detail on authorisations and advice on suitable methods of destruction please visit our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eight-toothed-european-spruce-bark-beetle-ips-typographus">Ips typographus guidance page</a>.</p>
