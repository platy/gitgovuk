<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We are offering a senior member of staff, within a school or college, the opportunity to receive a grant for training to develop the knowledge and skills to implement an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>The grant will cover, or contribute towards, the cost of DfE quality assured training for a senior member of school or college staff.</p>

<p>This guidance helps you complete the senior mental health lead training grant form.</p>

<h3>About the grant</h3>

<p>The grant must be used to pay for DfE quality assured training that provides a senior lead in your state-funded setting with the knowledge and skills to implement and sustain a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/promoting-children-and-young-peoples-emotional-health-and-wellbeing">whole school or college approach to emotional health and mental wellbeing</a>.</p>

<p>Grants are available for around one-third of all state-funded schools and colleges in the 2022 to 2023 financial year, with the aim of offering grants to all eligible settings by 2025.</p>

<p>If your setting meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding/senior-mental-health-lead-training-conditions-of-grant-for-the-2022-to-2023-financial-year">terms and conditions of grant</a>, is ready to develop or implement a whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing and has a senior mental health lead available to begin training on or before 31 March 2023, you should apply now using this form.</p>

<h3>Eligibility of the grant</h3>
<p>State-funded education settings in receipt of ESFA pre-16 revenue, high needs block, or 16 to 19 programme funding are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/senior-mental-health-lead-training-grant-funding/senior-mental-health-lead-training-conditions-of-grant-for-the-2022-to-2023-financial-year#eligible-settings">eligible to apply for a grant</a>, this includes:</p>

<h3>Sign in to your DfE Sign-in account</h3>
<p>Please try your DfE Sign-in credentials as soon as possible to avoid any issues with submitting your form.</p>

<p>After checking your DfE Sign-in information, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/senior-mental-health-leads" rel="external">senior mental health lead training form</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign in to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> using your username and password.</li>
  <li>If you are part of an FE college and have more than one eligible campus, choose the individual campus you want to complete the form for.</li>
  <li>The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you logged in. This will show the name, address, and unique reference number (URN) or UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who logged in via DfE Sign-in.</li>
  <li>If these details are correct, select ‘continue’ to move to the next page.</li>
  <li>If you believe they are incorrect or you are experiencing issues accessing the form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a> and we will investigate.</li>
  <li>Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation you are registering interest for.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For FE providers with individual campus IDs, you will need to select the campus ID which you are registering interest for.</p>
</div>

<p>You do not need to add any services in your DfE Sign-in account. It is used for authentication only, and the form will not appear in your list of services.</p>

<h3>If you do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h3>
<p>You will need to follow these steps to create one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> select the ‘create account’ button.</li>
  <li>Enter your name and email address (use your work email address or one that is clearly associated with your organisation).</li>
  <li>We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</li>

</ol>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisation’s approvers before you can access the form.</p>
