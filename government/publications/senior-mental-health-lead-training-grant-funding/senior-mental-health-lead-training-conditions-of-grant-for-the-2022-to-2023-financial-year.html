<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Department for Education (DfE) is offering a grant for senior mental health lead training to eligible state-funded schools and colleges in the 2022 to 2023 financial year.</p>

<p>Eligible settings that can begin training before May 2022 and want to develop, or introduce, their whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing are encouraged to apply for the grant.</p>

<p>The government remains committed to offering senior mental health lead training to all eligible state-funded schools and colleges by 2025.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Settings that have already claimed a grant in the 2021 to 2022 financial year are not eligible to apply for further funding.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Purpose of the senior mental health lead training grant</h2>
<p>Grants will cover, or contribute towards, the cost of DfE quality assured training for a senior member of school or college staff who will become the ‘senior mental health lead’ for that setting. The training will develop the knowledge and skills to implement an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing in their setting.</p>

<p>Senior mental health lead training is relevant to all education settings, and courses are available to meet the learning needs and preferences of senior leads regardless of their level of experience, type of setting or location.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Grant allocation and eligibility</h2>

<p>For each eligible setting that successfully completes their application, we will provide a fixed grant of £1,200 to train a senior lead.</p>

<p>Eligible settings will only be able to apply once for the training grant, which is intended to train a single senior mental health lead in each setting.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Eligible settings</h2>
<p>All state-funded education settings that are in receipt of ESFA pre-16 revenue, high needs block, or 16 to 19 programme funding are eligible for the grant, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies (including hospital schools)</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>special academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>further education colleges attended by under 18-year-olds (one claim per campus ID)</li>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Grant applications can only be submitted by individual settings. Settings within a single or multi-academy trust must claim individually. Distinct institutions (with a DfE campus ID) within larger further education colleges will each be eligible for a training grant.</p>

<p>Independent institutions (with fee-paying pupils and students) that do not receive the funding types outlined above are not eligible for a grant, but they can still access DfE assured training courses that are open to self-funded learners.</p>

<p>This training grant is not available for leaders of early years settings.</p>

<p>If you believe you are eligible to claim for this but are experiencing issues with the application process, contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MentalHealth.LeadTraining@education.gov.uk">MentalHealth.LeadTraining@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>To claim a grant, eligible settings must meet the conditions of grant as set out below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Terms on which the grant is allocated to eligible schools and colleges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Before you submit your grant claim you must:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>have the commitment of your school or college senior leadership team to implement a whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing in your setting</li>
  <li>have identified a senior mental health lead, ready to receive the training in the 2022 to 2023 financial year, and oversee your setting’s whole school or college approach</li>
</ul>

<p>When you apply for the grant, you’ll be asked to declare that these terms are met. You need to agree that the senior mental health lead in your setting will provide DfE with feedback following completion of the training, so that we can monitor how well it’s achieving the intended objectives.</p>

<p>You should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/senior-mental-health-lead-training">accompanying guidance</a>, and reflect on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995681/Learning_outcomes_for_senior_mental_health_leads_in_schools_and_colleges.pdf" rel="external">learning outcomes for the training</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Permissable spend</h3>

<p>The grant must be used to pay for DfE quality assured senior mental health training, to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to implement and sustain an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing in a setting. It will be paid as stated in section 14 of the Education Act 2002.</p>

<p>You can view the full published list of DfE <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/senior-mental-health-lead-training#providers-of-training">quality assured courses</a>.</p>

<p>Any element of the grant not spent on a DfE quality assured course can then be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for supply cover for the senior mental health lead, should a school or college need to backfill a senior lead while undertaking training</li>
  <li>to fund further training, activity or resources that supports the development of a senior mental health lead, and contributes to the implementation of an effective whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing in a setting</li>
</ul>

<p>Further training, activity or resources may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>additional courses or coaching that support the further development of the senior mental health lead, enabling them to establish, implement or sustain a whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>external support to assess your existing school or college approach to promoting and supporting mental health, to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement</li>
  <li>online resources and toolkits that support the senior lead, or other staff, to embed, sustain or otherwise improve the effectiveness of their whole school or college approach to mental health and wellbeing (many resources are available for free)</li>
  <li>other activities by the senior lead within their setting that focus on raising wider awareness and understanding of their whole school or college approach to better promote and support mental health (for example, promotion materials or awareness sessions for education staff)</li>
</ul>

<p>DfE does not consider the following expenditure as falling within the scope of further activity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employing counsellors or other professional individuals or groups to provide specific social, emotional or mental health interventions for children and young people</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Applying for a grant</h3>
<p>You can now apply for a grant if you are able to begin training by 31 May 2022.</p>

<p>When you apply through the grant application service you will be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide your school or college details to confirm you are an eligible setting</li>
  <li>make a series of declarations as described in the eligibility criteria and terms for the training grant</li>
</ul>

<p>You will then receive confirmation (including a confirmation email) that we have successfully received your application. This means you will have successfully reserved a training grant (despite being notified that you are on a waiting list) and can therefore proceed to book a DfE quality assured training course commencing up to, and including, 31 May 2022.</p>

<p>Please retain evidence of your booking as this will be needed to claim your grant.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 2022 to 2023 financial year, we will invite you to submit evidence of booking your DfE quality assured course through the second online form, so we can authorise your grant payment.</p>

<p>If you do not complete the second form within the deadline provided when you are invited to do so, we may release your place to other applicants to ensure grants do not go unclaimed.</p>

<p>You will need to provide satisfactory evidence that confirms which quality assured course(s) you have booked.</p>

<p>You will be asked to upload evidence of your booking, for example a scanned copy, screenshot, or photograph of your confirmation email(s) or invoice(s) from your training provider(s).</p>

<p>Please note that if your setting is due to change status (for example, by converting to an academy) you may not be able to access the online forms. If this is the case, contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MentalHealth.LeadTraining@education.gov.uk">MentalHealth.LeadTraining@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>When you will be paid</h3>
<p>Payments will be made following a satisfactory review of the information and evidence submitted in the second part of the application process. You will be contacted if any additional information is required to confirm that you have booked a DfE quality assured training course. This may mean there is a delay between form submission and funds being remitted.</p>

<p>Maintained schools and maintained alternative provision settings will receive payment via their local authority, whilst all other settings will receive payment directly. This payment will be made alongside your regular funding and will appear as a separate line on that remittance.</p>

<p>Local authorities will also receive a breakdown of which schools to pass funding to, and maintained schools and settings should contact their local authority if funds have not been received.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Opting into our programme evaluation</h2>
<p>DfE will collect and use the data submitted through the online forms to compile aggregate statistical information to develop and measure the impact of the service; and for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>By applying for a grant, you are accepting that an appropriate DfE representative will contact you directly to ask that you participate in our programme evaluation. This includes providing feedback on your completed training as a condition of your grant, and subsequently helping us to understand how the training is supporting schools and colleges to develop their approaches to mental health, to inform future support. Your school or college will also be included on a publicly available list to enable our partners to optimise their support of uptake and embeddedness.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Record keeping</h2>
<p>You should retain records to show that the grant has been used for the intended purposes for 6 years after the end of the financial year in which the expenditure has taken place.</p>

<p>The books and records of the school claiming the grant are open to inspection by the National Audit Office and our representatives.</p>

<p>We may request further information to determine if your school or college has complied with these conditions of grant.</p>

<p>Failure to provide this information may result in repayment of the whole or part of the grant paid.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Other terms</h2>
<p>You must inform us if the senior mental health lead is unable to complete the training or meet the other terms of the grant.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to withhold payment or seek reimbursement of payments already made if we consider that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have not spent the funding in accordance with this agreement</li>
  <li>have breached any other terms of this agreement</li>
  <li>have provided false or incorrect statements or information in your claim for funding</li>
</ul>

<p>The school or college will be informed of the above, in writing, along with the sum that immediately becomes payable, by the school or college, back to DfE.</p>
