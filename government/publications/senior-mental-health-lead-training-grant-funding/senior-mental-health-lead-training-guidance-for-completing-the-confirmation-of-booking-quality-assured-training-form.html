<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are offering schools and colleges (settings) a grant to pay for senior mental health lead training.</p>

<p>If you have already confirmed your eligibility and registered for a grant, you need to tell us which Department for Education (DfE) quality assured course you have booked to receive payment.</p>

<p>Your grant will be paid following a satisfactory review of the information provided in the ‘senior mental health lead training grant: confirmation of booking quality assured training’ form, which this guidance helps you to complete.</p>

<h2>Accessing the form</h2>

<p>You must complete this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/senior-mental-health-leads-confirmation" rel="external">confirmation of booking quality assured training form</a> so we can authorise payment of your grant.</p>

</div>

<h2>When to complete your submission</h2>

<p>You must complete this form within 3 weeks of the date you received your notification email from the department.</p>
