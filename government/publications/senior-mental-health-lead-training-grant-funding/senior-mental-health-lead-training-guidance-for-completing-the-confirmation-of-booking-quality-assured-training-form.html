<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are offering schools and colleges (settings) a grant to pay for senior mental health lead training.</p>

<p>If you have already confirmed your eligibility and registered for a grant, you need to tell us which Department for Education (DfE) quality assured course you have booked to receive payment.</p>

<p>Your grant will be paid following a satisfactory review of the information you submit in the ‘confirmation of booking quality assured training form’ which this guidance helps you to complete.</p>

<h2>Accessing the form</h2>

<p>You must complete this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/senior-mental-health-leads-confirmation" rel="external">confirmation of booking quality assured training form</a> so we can authorise payment of your grant.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You can only access this form if you have been invited to complete it by DfE, following your submission of the initial grant application form.</p>
</div>

<h2>When to complete your submission</h2>
<p>The DfE Senior Mental Health Lead team will email you directly when you are able to access the form, and you must submit by the deadline provided within the email (which will be at least 3 weeks).</p>

<p>After this date, your grant place will no longer be reserved and you will need to submit a new grant application form, subject to the availability of places.</p>
