<h2>PAYE</h2>

<h3>PAYE Settlement Agreements deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline for applying for a PAYE Settlement Agreement (<abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr>) or making any amendments to an existing <abbr title="PAYE Settlement Agreement">PSA</abbr> is 5 July following the tax year it applies to. For example, for the tax year 2021 to 2022 you have until 5 July 2022 to apply for or amend a PAYE Settlement Agreement.</p>

<p>If you are adding an item(s) to your  PAYE Settlement Agreement then you will receive an appendix to your existing agreement, not a new agreement.</p>

<p>The easement covering inclusion of Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) items in  PAYE Settlement Agreements was in place until September 2021. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-treat-certain-expenses-and-benefits-provided-to-employees-during-coronavirus-covid-19">How to treat <abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> expenses and benefits</a> contains more information.</p>

<p>Further guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-settlement-agreements">how to get a PAYE Settlement Agreement</a>  is available.</p>

<h3>Electronic payment deadline falls on a weekend</h3>

<p>This year the electronic payment deadline of 22 May falls on a Sunday. So, to make sure your payment for that month reaches us on time, you need to have cleared funds in HMRC’s account by 20 May 2022 unless you are able to arrange a Faster Payment.</p>

<p>Remember that it’s your responsibility to make sure your payments are made on time, and if your payment is late you may be charged a penalty.</p>

<p>So that you know what date to initiate your payment and make sure we  have it on time, speak to your bank or building society. Do this well in advance of making your payment and check their single transactions, daily  value limits and cut off times.</p>

<p>There is more information available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-paye-tax">how to pay us electronically</a>.</p>

<h3>Classification of company cars or vans for benefits in kind purposes</h3>
<p>HMRC would like to raise awareness of how vehicles should be classified for benefit in kind purposes.</p>

<p>On 20 July 2020, the Court of Appeal handed down its decision in respect of appeals by HMRC and Coca-Cola European Partners Great Britain Ltd and Others. The case considered three different vehicles and whether they should be classified as vans or cars.</p>

<p>The decision agreed with HMRC’s longstanding interpretation of the car benefits legislation which is that for benefits purposes, the ‘construction’ of a vehicle is that of the final product when it is made available to the employee. The use to which a vehicle is subsequently put is not relevant when considering the meaning of construction. The courts also explained that the correct approach was to determine what a vehicle was first and foremost suitable for. Only if the predominant suitability of the vehicles in question was for the conveyance of goods or burden, would it be accepted as a van. It should also be borne in mind that the courts ruled that a multi-purpose vehicle can have no primary suitability at all.</p>

<p>Further guidance to help employers determine the correct classification of a vehicle for benefits in kind purposes can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim23100">Employment Income Manual</a>. This will be of particular importance to employers that need to report company vehicles on form P11D prior to the filing date of 6 July 2022.</p>

<h3>Reporting expenses and benefits for tax year ending 5 April 2022</h3>

<h4>For those employers payrolling benefits in kind</h4>

<p>You may still have a Class 1A National Insurance contributions liability. You’ll still need to send a P11D(b) to tell us how much employer Class 1A National Insurance contributions you owe. You’ll also need to send a P11D to show any benefits you paid that you did not payroll. Instead of giving your employees a P11D, you need to give them a letter explaining what you’ve payrolled. You can find more information on Class 1A National Insurance contributions  from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/payrolling-tax-employees-benefits-and-expenses-through-your-payroll">payrolling your employees benefits and expenses guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>For those employers who have yet to join payrolling: Join for 2023 to 2024</h4>

<p>Register now to payroll your benefits from 6 April 2023. You’ll no longer need to submit a P11D for each employee for whom you payroll benefits. Payrolling is quicker and easier. If you are a large employer, this may save paper and will be much better for the environment.</p>

<p>If you have had an informal arrangement in place you must register now.</p>

<p>You can register and find out more on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/payrolling-tax-employees-benefits-and-expenses-through-your-payroll">payrolling and reporting expenses and benefits in kind</a>.</p>

<h4>Informally payrolling</h4>

<p>If you already had an informal agreement with HMRC to payroll benefits for 2021 to 2022 tax year, you can continue to submit P11Ds marked ‘Payrolled’. However, you should plan to formalise this agreement as soon as possible. HMRC may no longer accept new informal arrangements.</p>

<h4>For those employers which do not yet payroll</h4>

<p>The deadline for reporting any P11D expenses and benefits in kind is 6 July 2022. You need to do this for each employee you have provided expenses or benefits to.</p>

<h4>How to report</h4>

<p>HMRC considers paper submissions  to be generally unacceptable. We’re maintaining a paper process for those who cannot yet file online and have not yet moved to payrolling.</p>

<p>You can use any of the following quick and easy digital methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/payroll-software">commercial payroll software</a></li>
  <li>HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online">PAYE online service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Online filing is quicker and easier. It’s also more secure and the software can tell you immediately if you have made any common errors.</p>

<p>If you are unable to use either of the digital methods you can use our official forms P11D and P11D(b). If your report is late, your employees could pay the wrong amount of tax and experience financial hardship.</p>

<h4>Helping you to get it right first time</h4>

<p>If you make a mistake or send in your form late, your employees could pay the wrong amount of tax and you could end up with a penalty, so it’s important that you get it right.</p>

<p>You need to submit a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-end-of-year-expenses-and-benefits-p11db">P11D(b) form</a> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ve submitted any P11D forms</li>
  <li>you’ve paid any employees’ expenses or benefits through your payroll</li>
  <li>HMRC has asked you to file a P11D(b) – either by sending you a P11D(b) form or an email notification to file a P11D(b)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your P11D(b) tells HMRC how much employers’ Class 1A National Insurance contributions you need to pay on all the expenses and benefits you’ve provided to your employees through your payroll as well as any you have reported to HMRC on a P11D.</p>

<h4>Nothing to declare</h4>

<p>If HMRC has asked you to submit a P11D(b) and you have nothing to declare, you can tell us you do not owe any employers’ Class 1A National Insurance contributions by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paye-no-return-of-class-1a-national-insurance-contributions">completing a declaration</a> ‘No return of Class 1A National Insurance contributions’. Only use this declaration if HMRC has asked you to submit a P11D(b) and you have nothing to declare.</p>

<h4>P11D lists</h4>

<p>In exceptional circumstances where you have to file P11Ds on paper and do so in list form you must use the following format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use Arial font size 11 or larger (when printed)</li>
  <li>sort it by employee, not benefit type</li>
  <li>include your employer reference</li>
  <li>include the employee’s correct name and National Insurance Number</li>
  <li>put each employee’s expenses and benefits on the same line (we cannot accept separate lists for each benefit)</li>
  <li>include the letter codes from the P11D next to each benefit (shown in dark blue boxes to the left of each section)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that, if you do not provide the information in the correct format,  the list may be returned to you. If it’s returned late, you may receive a penalty.</p>

<h4>Paying your Class 1A National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>There is a specific reference you need to use to make your Class 1A payment. This is your normal Accounts Office reference plus the numerals 2213 at the end. Do not leave a space between any of the numbers.</p>

<p>This is an example of the correct format, but use your own reference number:</p>

<p>123PA001234562213</p>

<p>If you are paying at a bank or sending a cheque, you must use the correct payment slip. It’s pre-printed with the reference in the format above. We will not know you’ve paid your Class 1A charge  if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not use the right payment slip</li>
  <li>use an incorrect reference</li>
</ul>

<p>We may send payment reminders and default notices until your payment is allocated correctly. More information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-class-1a-national-insurance">how to pay</a>.</p>

<h4>Working Sheets</h4>

<p>Use the working sheets available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-forms-p11d-and-p11db">how to complete your P11D and P11D(b)</a> to help you reduce errors.</p>

<p>Do not send HMRC your working sheets.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hm-revenue-and-customs-employer-bulletin">February 2022 edition of the Employer Bulletin</a> we advised customers of the decommissioning of HMRC’s Online end of year expenses and benefits service in April 2022.</p>

<h3>The official rate of interest for the 2022 to 2023 tax year</h3>
<p>HMRC has announced that the official rate of interest will remain at 2% for the 2022 to 2023 tax year. The official rate of interest is used to calculate the Income Tax charge on the benefit of employment-related loans and the taxable benefit of employer-provided living accommodation.</p>

<p>How will this affect you? If you provide employment related loans or living accommodation to your employees, you will need to know the correct interest rate to apply when you calculate the value of any benefit for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h3>Student and postgraduate loans</h3>

<h4>Student and postgraduate loan generic notification service messages to employers</h4>

<p>HMRC sends student and postgraduate loan generic notification service messages to employers as a reminder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to start taking student and or postgraduate loan deductions</li>
  <li>to stop taking student and or postgraduate loan deductions</li>
  <li>to use the correct plan type HMRC has provided</li>
  <li>not to take student and or postgraduate loan deductions for an employee who is subject to the off-payroll working rules or only has an occupational pension rather than a salary</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you check the HMRC Online services for generic notification service messages.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/special-rules-for-student-loans">generic notification service messages</a> is available.</p>

<h4>Student and postgraduate loans thresholds and rates from 6 April 2022</h4>

<p>The 2022 to 2023 thresholds and rates for Student and Postgraduate Loans were published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/employer-bulletin-february-2022">February’s Employer Bulletin</a>.</p>

<p>Full information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/special-rules-for-student-loans">plan and loan types</a> (including thresholds) is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Freeports employer National Insurance contributions relief</h3>

<p>Freeports are part of the government’s work to ‘level up’ and boost economic activity across the UK.</p>

<p>The government has legislated for Employer National Insurance contributions as part of the Freeport tax offer.</p>

<p>This relief will be applicable to the earnings of all new Freeports employees, up to £25,000 per annum. 
It will be available from 6 April 2022 until April 2026, for 36 months per employee.</p>

<p>Find out if you can claim on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-claim-national-insurance-relief-in-freeport-tax-sites">Freeports employers National Insurance relief</a>.</p>

<h4>Exemption to the 60% rule</h4>

<p>To qualify for this relief, employees need to spend 60% of their working time in a designated Freeport tax site. The government has legislated for an exemption to this rule, where an employer has made an adjustment to their employees working pattern to accommodate the following protected characteristics: disability, pregnancy and maternity.</p>

<p>HMRC has published its  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual/nim01000">National Insurance manuals</a> for this policy.</p>

<h3>National Insurance holiday for employers of veterans: claims process now live</h3>

<p>In April 2021 the government introduced the National Insurance holiday for employers of veterans.  This relief allows employers who hire former members of the UK regular armed forces, during the first year of their civilian employment, to apply a zero-rate of secondary National Insurance contributions for up to 12 months.</p>

<p>From 6 April 2022, employers can claim this relief retrospectively for the period April 2021 to April 2022. They can claim through Real Time Information submissions going forward.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-national-insurance-contributions-relief-for-veterans-as-an-employer">Guidance on claiming National Insurance relief</a>  explains the qualifying rules and claims process for both 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 tax years. Employers are recommended to study this guidance to see if they are eligible to claim the relief.</p>

<h3>Claiming Employment Allowance from April 2022</h3>

<p>On 23 March the Chancellor announced that from April 2022, the Employment Allowance would increase to £5,000 per year. This change has now come into effect.</p>

<p>Before claiming, check you are still eligible by visiting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-employment-allowance">Employment Allowance guidance</a>.</p>

<p>For 2020 to 2021 tax years onwards, you can only claim the Employment Allowance if your total secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions liability is below £100,000 in the tax year before the year of claim. You’ll continue to claim the Employment Allowance through your payroll using the Employer Payment Summary. Where your payroll software has been updated, you’ll automatically receive the increased allowance of up to £5,000 for 2022 to 2023. You can also claim the Employment Allowance by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using HMRCs Basic PAYE Tools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>making a payroll adjustment to reduce your secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions to reflect the increased Employment Allowance</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, HMRC will advise you where you have an overpayment so that you can make an adjustment.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) updates and information</h2>

<h3>Extended loss carry back</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extended-loss-carry-back-for-businesses">extended loss carry back easement</a> allows companies to make claims to carry back losses of accounting periods ending between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2022 by a further two years.</p>

<p>Claims that exceed the £200,000 de minimis must be made in a Company Tax Return. You should complete Box 45 on the CT600 and include details of the carry back claims in the computations accompanying the CT600 and accounts.</p>

<p>You do not need to submit amended returns for the periods the extended relief applies to as the claims will be treated as amendments to those returns.</p>

<p>Claims to carry a trading loss back below the £200,000 de minimis can be made through HMRC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-calculating-and-claiming-a-loss">online form</a>.</p>

<h3>Reminder to declare coronavirus grants on Company Tax Returns</h3>

<p>Coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) grants and payments issued by HMRC to support businesses and self-employed individuals during the pandemic are taxable.</p>

<p>If you need to complete a Company Tax Return (CT600) you must include any Coronavirus support payments made to the company.  When calculating your taxable profits in the usual way, you’ll need to include as income:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) grants</li>
  <li>Eat Out to Help Out payments</li>
  <li>coronavirus support payments made by local authorities, devolved administrations or other public authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>If an agent is completing a Company Tax Return on your behalf, make sure to tell them what coronavirus support payments you received. This is particularly important if another agent made a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> claim on your behalf, or you claimed a grant yourself.</p>

<p>If you received either a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant, or an Eat Out to Help Out payment, or both, they will also need to be included in the specific boxes provided on the CT600.</p>

<p>You should put:</p>

<ul>
  <li>taxable grants and payments in boxes 471, 472 and 647</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> or EOHO overpayments in boxes 473, 474 and 526</li>
</ul>

<p>These boxes were added to the CT600 on 6 April 2021. If you received a <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> grant or an Eat Out to Help Out payment without completing the relevant boxes, your return may need to be amended.</p>

<p>If you’ve already filed your Company Tax Return, you will only need to submit an amended return if you:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Cycle to Work coronavirus policy easement ending</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, in December 2020, the UK government announced a time limited easement.  The easement was for employees who, on or before 20 December 2020:</p>

<ul>
  <li>joined an employer-provided cycling scheme</li>
  <li>received a cycle or cyclist’s safety equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>Employees who joined a scheme from 21 December 2020 would need to meet all the normal conditions of the Cycle to Work scheme.  </p>

<p>Where eligible, employees would not have to meet the ’qualifying journeys’ condition until after 5 April 2022.  </p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim21664">rules of the scheme</a> have not changed. As of 5 April 2022, all employees on an existing cycling scheme need to meet the normal conditions, including the ’qualifying journeys’ condition.</p>

<h3>Easement ends for employee home-office expenses</h3>

<p>Existing rules prior to the coronavirus (<abbr title="Coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>) pandemic provided Income Tax and National Insurance contributions exemptions, where employers provide employees with equipment to allow them to work from home. This rule remains in place.</p>

<p>Prior to the pandemic, where an employee purchased the equipment and was then reimbursed by their employer, the exemption did not apply. Due to coronavirus, an easement was put in place under regulations to allow relief in situations where employers reimbursed employees buying their own office equipment to enable them to work from home during the pandemic.</p>

<p>This easement ended on 5 April 2022. This is because as UK government restrictions are lifted, working from home is no longer a legal requirement.</p>

<h3>Tax on UK income for non-UK residents</h3>

<p>In 2020 HMRC introduced guidance stating non-UK resident employees stuck in the UK because of coronavirus travel restrictions would not be taxed on earnings for duties performed in the UK after their planned departure date, provided they were taxed in their home state.    </p>

<p>This easement ended on 5 April 2022. If you have non-UK resident employees, any days they spend working in the UK from 6 April 2022 onwards will be treated as days on which they performed duties in the UK. More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad">how to tax your UK income if you live abroad</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Tax updates and changes to guidance</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> reverse charge for construction and building services</h3>

<p><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered construction businesses should note that this reverse charge came in on 1 March 2021. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/revenue-and-customs-brief-7-2020-domestic-reverse-charge-vat-for-construction-services-delay-in-implementation">Revenue and Customs Brief 7 (2020)</a> contains more information. </p>

<p>In January 2021, a letter was sent to every <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered construction business. This followed letters previously sent out in February 2020 and September 2020, advising them to check if they’re liable for the reverse charge. If they’re liable, they need to apply these rules.</p>

<p>Find more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-domestic-reverse-charge-for-building-and-construction-services">scope and operation of the reverse charge</a>. </p>

<p>The key aspects are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It applies to standard and reduced-rated supplies of building and construction services made to <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> and Construction Industry Scheme (<abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>) registered businesses, who in turn also make onward supplies of those building and construction services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The contractor is responsible for paying the output <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> due rather than the sub-contractor, and can continue to reclaim this amount as input tax.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scope of supplies affected is closely aligned to the supplies required to be reported under the <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr>, but does not include supplies of staff or workers for use by the customer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplies to <abbr title="Construction Industry Scheme">CIS</abbr> registered businesses can be excluded from the reverse charge if the customer is an ‘end user’ or ‘intermediary supplier’ (a business that is closely associated with an end user). This exclusion covers property developers and other ‘deemed contractors’ provided that the construction services concerned are not being re-supplied by them.  However, this exclusion is optional and only applies if the customer notifies their supplier in writing that they are an ‘end user’ or ‘intermediary supplier’. This can be done by correspondence or as part of terms and conditions. There is more detail in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/vat-reverse-charge-technical-guide"><abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> reverse charge technical guidance</a>. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve been running <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/help-and-support-for-vat">webinars for businesses</a> and they can register now. If there are no dates available, a webinar recording can be viewed. </p>

<h3>The Administrative Burdens Advisory Board 2022 Tell ABAB survey</h3>

<p>Small businesses are being invited to share their views on the tax system by completing a short survey.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ondemand.questionmark.eu/delivery/open.php?session=0386163000386163&amp;customerid=607443&amp;name=TellABAB&amp;group=2022" rel="external">Tell ABAB survey 2022</a> only takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>You can tell the Administrative Burdens Advisory Board your views in the survey which is open until 4 May 2022.</p>

<p>The feedback will help the board achieve their goal of making a difference for small businesses by working closely with HMRC to help make tax easier, quicker and simpler.</p>

<p>Administrative Burdens Advisory Board members are independent and come from a wide range of businesses and professions who represent the small business community. Their work involves listening to the views of small businesses about their experience of the tax system.</p>

<p>Results from the survey will be published on GOV.UK during summer 2022, in the Tell ABAB Report.</p>

<h3>Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> is coming to all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses</h3>

<p>From April 2022, all <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses, regardless of taxable turnover, will be required to follow Making Tax Digital (<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>) rules.</p>

<p>This means using <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>-compatible software to keep digital records and submitting <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> returns through Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Businesses should start keeping digital records for their first <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> return period, starting on or after 1 April 2022, and sign up to Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> at least 72 hours before their first return is due.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>-registered businesses must now take steps to switch to Making Tax Digital for <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr> if they have not done so already. We’re writing to all businesses who have not yet signed up to remind them of the actions they need to take.</p>

<p>Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-record-keeping">support on Making Tax Digital</a> is available.</p>

<h3>Off-payroll working rules (IR35)</h3>

<p>It has been one year since the off-payroll working rules (IR35) changed in the private and voluntary sectors. Detailed information is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/business-tax/ir35">Off-payroll working</a> (IR35), to help you understand the rules and operate them correctly.  </p>

<p>There will be some client organisations in the private and voluntary sectors who did not meet the size conditions.  As a result, they did not need to apply the rules for 2021 to 2022, but they should now.</p>

<p>Make sure you check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm10006">Employment  Status manual</a> for whether the rules apply to you every year. This is particularly true if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>become a newly formed business</li>
  <li>been bought by another organisation</li>
  <li>grown in size over the last few years</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are new to the rules, you may find the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prepare-for-changes-to-the-off-payroll-working-rules-ir35">Steps you need to take guidance to off-payroll working rules</a> useful. </p>

<p>If you are a small client organisation in the private or voluntary sectors and do not need to apply the rules, your contractors own limited company – often known as a personal service company (PSC) – will still need to consider and apply the rules. You may want to confirm with your contractors that you are not responsible for the rules due to not meeting the size conditions, and that they remain responsible for operating the rules. </p>

<p>A large part of HMRC’s focus remains on helping client organisations get things right and we are continuing to contact some organisations. If you are contacted, we will work with you to confirm and ensure that you are applying the rules correctly. This is in line with our compliance approach outlining <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-issue-briefing-supporting-organisations-to-comply-with-changes-to-the-off-payroll-working-rules-ir35">how we will support customers to comply with the changes</a> to the off-payroll working rules. </p>

<p>The published compliance approach states that customers will not have to pay penalties as a result of mistakes made when applying the rules in the first 12 months after the rules took effect (April 2021), unless there’s evidence of deliberate non-compliance. This is regardless of when the inaccuracies are identified. This first 12 months has now ended, and penalties may now be charged on any inaccuracies relating to the operation of the rules that occur after April 2022.</p>

<p>We are also considering what changes we can make to our guidance and support to continue to help you to comply and would welcome any feedback on the support available and what additional support might be helpful. In particular, if you work in a sector, or engage contractors in particular roles, which you feel could benefit from additional support on the changes to the rules then please get in touch. You can contact us about our support available by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:offpayrollworking.legislation@hmrc.gov.uk">offpayrollworking.legislation@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Payroll software indicator</h4>

<p>Your payroll software should include an indicator to enable you to notify HMRC of any engagements being paid which are subject to the off-payroll working rules (IR35). This is likely to be named the ‘off-payroll worker subject to the rules’ indicator.</p>

<p>It is mandatory to use this indicator for engagements determined to be inside the off-payroll working rules. It is only to be used by the deemed employer responsible for deducting Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on payments being made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the contractors own limited company</li>
  <li>other intermediary – this could be a client organisation or an agency</li>
</ul>

<p>The indicator is not to be used for any payments made which are not subject to the off-payroll working rules (IR35), for example payments made to contractors working as sole traders. It is also not to be used by a contractors own limited company  – often known as a personal service company (PSC).</p>

<p>If you have used this indicator incorrectly, please make sure this is corrected urgently on a corrective Full Payment Submission for the relevant period.</p>

<h3>Naming tax avoidance promoters</h3>

<p>As part of the approach to support taxpayers to steer clear, or move out, of tax avoidance, HMRC has published the first set of the names of those involved in the promotion and supply of tax avoidance schemes along with details of the schemes they are selling.</p>

<p>The aim of publishing this list is to enable taxpayers to spot avoidance schemes more easily and understand the risks of getting involved in them.</p>

<p>The first iteration of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers">list of those involved in promotion and supply of tax avoidance schemes</a> will be updated regularly by HMRC.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Be aware that it is not a complete list of all tax avoidance schemes currently being marketed or all promoters, enablers and suppliers.</p>
</div>

<p>There may be other schemes, promoters, enablers and suppliers that HMRC cannot publish information about at this time.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Use the list to help you identify tax avoidance schemes and those promoting them, so you don’t get caught out.</p>
</div>

<h3>Hybrid working: Employment Income Manual guidance</h3>

<p>HMRC has recognised an increase in the number of employers offering hybrid working arrangements. We have updated guidance within the Employment Income Manual to reflect this. There have been no changes to the relevant legislation or policies.</p>

<p>We have introduced new signposting pages for travel expenses. This is to enhance navigation across the existing guidance and to highlight pages that are most appropriate to those working under hybrid working arrangements. These can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim31801">EIM31801</a>,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim31802">EIM31802</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim31803">EIM31803</a>.</p>

<p>We have made amendments to guidance on the tax treatment of certain homeworking costs and equipment, as well as the homeworking deduction, to provide certainty of HMRC’s view on the application of such rules under hybrid working arrangements. The guidance at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim21611">EIM21611</a> , <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim01471">EIM01471</a> , <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim01472">EIM01472</a> , <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim32790">EIM32790</a> , <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim32795">EIM32795</a>  and<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim32810"> 
EIM32810</a>  has been amended.</p>

<h3>Working from home: claiming tax relief from April 2022</h3>

<p>Government instructions to work from home where possible, including the legal requirement to self-isolate if you or a close contact tested positive for coronavirus, meant that in tax years 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 millions of people across the UK were eligible to claim tax relief on additional household costs incurred due to working from home.</p>

<p>The rules around the eligibility of the tax relief remain unchanged. But the lifting of pandemic restrictions means that most will no longer be eligible to claim from April 2022.</p>

<p>Employees can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/working-at-home">online service for claiming tax relief for working from home</a>. This microservice was introduced to help speed up the claims process. It remains in place for the 2022 to 2023 tax year. For the reasons explained above, we expect claim levels to return to something close to pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>Employers can still choose to reimburse employees for reasonable additional household expenses that the employee incurred while carrying out employment duties at home under homeworking arrangements.</p>

<p>Where employers choose to make a payment to employees, employees cannot also claim from HMRC through the online service. This is unless employer payments are below £6 per week. In this case employees can claim the difference, providing all other eligibility requirements are met.</p>

<p>We have updated our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/working-at-home">guidance on claiming tax relief for working from home</a> to</p>

<ul>
  <li>make the eligibility criteria clearer</li>
  <li>help people understand better what can be claimed and what cannot</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help your employees understand their Child Benefit entitlements</h3>

<p>Do any of your employees have a total taxable income of over £50,000? They may have to pay a tax charge, known as the ‘High Income Child Benefit Charge’ if they or their partner get Child Benefit.</p>

<p>Telling your employees about the High Income Child Benefit Charge may help them to understand their obligations and avoid facing a penalty.</p>

<p>Employees with income over £50,000 and who get, or whose partner gets, Child Benefit should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check their annual income either on their P60(s) or their personal tax account</li>
  <li>add any taxable benefits, for example medical insurance, company car or accommodation</li>
  <li>use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-calculator">child benefit tax calculator</a> to work out how much they may have to pay</li>
  <li>register for self-assessment if liable for the High Income Benefit Charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Being liable for the High Income Child Benefit Charge does not mean parents are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. It just means they either have to complete a Self Assessment to pay the tax charge or opt out of getting Child Benefit payments.</p>

<p>By claiming Child Benefit, but then opting out of getting Child Benefit payments, parents ensure they still qualify for National Insurance credits, which help to build entitlement to their State Pension. It will also help their children get a National Insurance number automatically when they turn 16.</p>

<p>First time parents need to fill in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-benefit-claim-form-ch2">Child Benefit claim form</a> and send it to the Child Benefit Office. If they have not registered the birth, they should add a note with their claim to let us know. Child Benefit claims can be backdated for three months.</p>

<p>More Information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit">Child Benefit</a> is available.</p>

<p>You can get further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge">High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge</a>.</p>

<h3>Help shape UK central government complaint handling</h3>

<p>Share your feedback on the UK central government complaint standards by taking part in a simple survey.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/gcs" rel="external">survey asking about the new standards to improve complaint handling</a>. A unified set of standards will be used by UK central government departments to improve complaint handling which focuses on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>welcoming complaints in a positive way and recognising them as valuable insight for organisations</li>
  <li>supporting a thorough and fair approach that accurately reflects the experiences of everyone involved</li>
  <li>encouraging fair and accountable responses that provide open and honest answers as soon as possible</li>
  <li>promoting a learning culture by supporting organisations to see complaints as opportunities to improve services.</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC strives to offer a good service to all our customers, all of the time. When things go wrong, people may want to complain or raise a concern. When they do, the complaint standards will help HMRC deliver a service that meets the Charter commitments and use the rich insight they provide to improve customer experience.</p>

<p>The survey closes on 31 May 2022 and everybody is invited to respond.</p>
