<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide sets out the evidence required for applications relating to the death of a registered proprietor and deals with registered estates only. However, under section 4 of the Land Registration Act 2002, you will need to apply for first registration of an unregistered estate that is the subject of a transfer or assent. For further details, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registrations">practice guide 1: first registrations</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Retention of documents submitted with applications</h3>

<p>If your application is a first registration, original documents are normally required.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> may, however, make an application for first registration on the basis of certified copy deeds and documents only. For information about this see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/first-registrations/practice-guide-1-first-registrations#acceptance-of-certified-copy-deeds">practice guide 1: first registrations – Applications lodged by conveyancers – acceptance of certified copy deeds</a>.</p>

<p>If your application is not a first registration, we only need certified copies of deeds or documents you send to us with HM Land Registry applications. Once we have made a scanned copy of the documents you send to us they will be destroyed. This applies to both originals and certified copies.</p>

<p>Any original copies of death certificates or grants of probate will continue to be returned.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Death of a sole proprietor (or sole surviving proprietor) of a registered estate or of a charge or mortgage</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Grants of probate or letters of administration</h3>

<p>You will need a grant of probate or letters of administration to deal with property in England and Wales. The grant of probate or letters of administration must be granted by a court in either England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>An appointment of personal representatives obtained outside the UK is not acceptable unless it has been resealed by a court of probate in the UK. If the foreign grant cannot be resealed a full grant of representation granted in the UK will be required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Registration of the personal representative(s)</h3>

<p>The personal representative(s) of a sole registered proprietor of a registered estate or of a charge or mortgage may apply to be registered as proprietor(s) of the estate, charge or mortgage in their capacity as personal representative(s) in place of the deceased proprietor. To apply for registration in this way you will need to send us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>application <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-the-register-ap1">form AP1</a>
</li>
  <li>a certified or office copy of the grant of probate or letters of administration, or a court order appointing the applicant(s) as the deceased’s personal representative(s) or (where a <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> is acting for the applicant(s)) a certificate given by a <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> that they hold the original or an office copy of the probate, letters of administration or court order. The certificate must include confirmation of the granting of the grant of probate, letters of administration or court order in the United Kingdom</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out what happens to documents submitted with application forms, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#retention-documents">Retention of documents submitted with applications</a>.</p>

<p>Once they are registered as proprietors, the personal representatives can later transfer or assent the estate, or the charge or mortgage. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#registration-disposition">Registration of a disposition by the personal representatives</a>.</p>

<p>Where a limited grant of representation has been issued, and the grantee is registered as proprietor, we may add a note to the proprietor entry to reflect the limitations of the grant and that any power to dispose of the registered estate or charge may come to an end.</p>

<p>Where the person absolutely entitled is a minor, we will enter a restriction only if one is applied for in form RX1.</p>

<p>Where a grant is issued to a person during widowhood, or where the will is lost, destroyed or damaged, a restriction will not be required as the form of the proprietor entry will make the position clear.</p>

<p>Where the grant is to the attorney of an executor or person entitled to a grant of letters of administration, a restriction will be entered by the registrar of his own volition (in the absence of an application for one) that will require a statutory declaration or statement of truth by the grantee to be lodged to support a subsequent disposition of the registered estate or charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Registration of a disposition by the personal representative(s)</h3>

<p>The personal representative(s) of a deceased sole proprietor of the registered estate, or of a charge or mortgage may, without first being registered themselves in that capacity, deal with that registered estate or charge. They may do this by way of a transfer, or a transfer by way of an assent or appropriation using the appropriate form in either case. To apply to register such a disposition you will need to send us:</p>

<p>Note 2: For the vesting of registered estates in a new tenant for life where there is a settlement under the Settled Land Act 1925, use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/whole-of-registered-title-assent-as1">form AS1</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/part-of-registered-title-assent-as3">form AS3</a> as appropriate. Add the following provisions, with any necessary alterations and additions, to the additional provisions panel.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“The Personal Representative and the Recipient declare that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Property is vested in the Recipient upon the trusts declared in the will of (name of deceased) proved on (date);</li>
  <li>the trustees of the settlement are (names of trustees);</li>
  <li>the power of appointment of new trustees is vested in (name);</li>
  <li>the following powers relating to registered estates are expressly conferred by the will in addition to those conferred by the Settled Land Act 1925: (set out additional powers).”</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>You should also make an application for the proper restriction using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enter-a-restriction-registration-rx1">form RX1</a>. The special grant must be lodged in support.</p>

<h4>2.3.1 Attorney of an executor or person entitled to the grant of letters of administration</h4>

<p>Where the disposition is by the attorney of an executor or person entitled to a grant of letters of administration, we will require a statutory declaration or statement of truth from the attorney confirming that, as at the date of the disposition, they had not received notice of the death of the executor or person entitled to the grant of letters of administration, or of an application by that person for a grant of representation.</p>

<p>A transfer or assent by an attorney requires the notional registration of the attorney as proprietor of the registered estate (or charge), which would, if such registration had taken place separately, have resulted in the entry of a restriction to make sure any power to dispose of the registered estate (or charge) has not come to an end.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 Limited grant of representation</h4>

<p>A limited grant of representation may be issued in a number of situations. This includes when the individual named as executor is a minor or when the original will has been lost or destroyed. In other circumstances, a grantee may only be entitled to act until further representation is sought, or during their widowhood.</p>

<p>In these situations, we will require a certificate from the <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> acting for the personal representative confirming that further representation has not been sought or granted, and that (if applicable) the person for whose use and benefit the grant was obtained is still alive.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> should also certify that the specific limitation recorded in the grant remained applicable at the date of the disposition - for example, that a minor for whose use and benefit the grant was obtained had not attained the age of 18.</p>

<p>Where the original will has been lost or destroyed and the personal representative was registered on the basis of a limited grant, we will require a certificate from the <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> acting for the personal representative that as at the date of the disposition neither the original will nor a more complete or authentic copy of it had subsequently been proved.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Discharge of a charge or mortgage of which the deceased was the sole proprietor</h3>
<p>The personal representatives of a deceased sole proprietor of a charge or mortgage may, without first being registered themselves in that capacity, wish to apply to cancel the registration of the charge or mortgage after it has been discharged. To make an application to us you will need to send us:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Liability for death duties</h2>

<p>Where the proprietor of a registered estate died before 13 March 1975 and it appeared that the registered estate was subject to a charge for death duties, we used to make the following entry in the register as a matter of course.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Until the registration of a disposition in favour of a purchaser for money or money’s worth, the land is liable to such death duties as may be payable or arise by reason of the death of A.B. of [address] who died on [date].”</p>
</div>

<p>We automatically cancel this entry upon the registration of a transfer of the registered estate on sale or other disposition for value. However, you can apply to cancel it at any time by lodging <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a> completed by the Commissioners of HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Liability for capital transfer tax</h2>

<p>When inheritance tax is due to the Commissioners of HM Revenue &amp; Customs, a statutory charge in their favour is imposed on the registered estate that is the subject of the gift. The Commissioners can, when they so wish, apply using <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/agreed-notice-registration-an1">form AN1</a> to protect this charge by entering in the register an agreed notice under rules 80 and 81, Land Registration Rules 2003 as follows.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Notice of an Inland Revenue charge (Reference number –        ) in respect of such      tax as may arise      .”</p>
</div>

<p>Where appropriate, we may also make such an entry at the time of first registration of the estate.</p>

<p>When such an entry appears in the register we will only cancel it upon receipt of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-cancellation-cn1">form CN1</a> completed by the Commissioners of HM Revenue &amp; Customs. If the Commissioners have certified in the form CN1 that the application for cancellation is only to take effect upon the registration of a disposition to a purchaser, then we will remove the entry from the register only when the form CN1 is accompanied by a proper application to register the transfer, or other specified disposition, in favour of the purchaser. The entry will remain in the register even upon the registration of a transfer on sale until we receive a form CN1 completed by the Commissioners.</p>

<p>On application for first registration not based on a disposition for value and where a gift has been made within 8 years of the date of the application, where no charge is disclosed and no class D(i) land charge is registered, consideration will be given as to whether any liability to capital transfer tax or inheritance tax has arisen.</p>

<p>If it appears from the application that the property being registered may be subject to a charge for inheritance tax we will inform you that we intend to make the following entry in the register.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“Notice of the possibility of an Inland Revenue charge in respect of such inheritance tax as may arise as a result of the death of                          who died on                            .”</p>
</div>

<p>However, if you set out in writing details of the surrounding circumstances of the case and confirm that either no inheritance tax was ever payable, or that it has been paid in full, the entry will not be made. Alternatively, you can supply a certificate of discharge from HM Revenue &amp; Customs, or a letter from them addressed to the registrar confirming this.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Trusts</h2>

<p>Where land is held on trust a restriction in standard Form A or an earlier equivalent may have been entered in the register. For more information on trusts of land and standard Form A restrictions, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/private-trusts-of-land">practice guide 24: private trusts of land</a>.</p>

<p>The Form A restriction reads:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>“No disposition by a sole proprietor of the registered estate (except a trust corporation) under which capital money arises is to be registered except under an order of the Court.”</p>
</div>

<p>An application to register a disposition under which capital money arises made by a sole surviving proprietor will be caught by an existing Form A restriction. Because only the beneficial interest passes on the death of a joint proprietor to their personal representatives this will be the case even if the personal representatives act with the surviving proprietor. Where the land continues to be held on trust a second trustee should be appointed to act with the surviving proprietor. This is in contrast to a disposition by the personal representatives of a sole surviving proprietor. Here the legal estate vests in the personal representatives on the death of the sole proprietor (section 1(1) of the Administration of Estates Act 1925). Provided there are at least 2 personal representatives, a disposition will not be caught by the restriction.</p>

<p>If following the death of a joint proprietor a sole surviving proprietor has become the sole beneficial owner, consideration should be given to applying to cancel any existing Form A restriction – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#removal-restriction">Removal of a restriction in Form A from the register</a>. The same applies when, as a result of a change in the trusts, the continuing registered proprietors have become entitled as beneficial joint tenants.</p>

<p>A Form A restriction will be cancelled automatically only when a transfer which overreaches any interests under a trust is registered. Where there has been no such transfer but any trusts on which the land was held have come to an end, applying to cancel the restriction at the earliest opportunity may avoid problems arising on a future disposition when the necessary evidence is no longer readily available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Removal of a restriction in Form A from the register</h2>

<p>Application for cancellation of the restriction should be made in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancel-a-restriction-registration-rx3">form RX3</a> accompanied by evidence of the equitable title to show that the sole survivor has become the sole beneficial owner, or if there is still more than one registered proprietor, how they have become <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/joint-property-ownership/change-from-tenants-in-common-to-joint-tenants">joint tenants instead of tenants in common</a>.</p>

<p>The evidence we usually accept is a statutory declaration or statement of truth in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cancellation-of-restriction-statement-of-truth-st5">form ST5</a> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statements-of-truth">practice guide 73: statements of truth</a>) by the sole surviving proprietor(s) which shows how they have become the beneficial owner by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explaining what has happened to the beneficial interest protected by the restriction</li>
  <li>if it has passed to the surviving proprietor(s), explaining how this happened</li>
  <li>(where there remains one registered proprietor) confirming, if it is true, that no one other than the remaining/surviving registered proprietor now has a beneficial interest in the property</li>
  <li>(where there remains 2 or more registered proprietors) confirming, if it is true, that they hold the property on trust for themselves (and no one else) as beneficial joint tenants</li>
  <li>confirming, if it is true, that no beneficial interest in the property has been separately mortgaged or charged, and that no beneficial owner is or was subject to a charging order or bankruptcy proceedings (a registered mortgage does not count)</li>
</ul>

<p>Form ST5 can also be used to apply for cancellation of a Form A restriction in the register when, as a result of a change in the trusts, the continuing registered proprietors have become entitled as beneficial joint tenants.</p>

<p>Instead of a statutory declaration or statement of truth, we will accept a certificate to the same effect from the <abbr title="An authorised person within the meaning of section 18 of the Legal Services Act 2007 who is entitled to provide the conveyancing services referred to in paragraphs 5(1)(a) and (b) of Schedule 2 to that Act, or a person carrying out those activities in the course of their duties as a public officer. It also includes an individual or body who employs or has among their managers such an authorised person who will undertake or supervise those conveyancing activities (rule 217A of the LRR 2003)">conveyancer</abbr> acting for the surviving proprietor(s) if they are able to speak from personal knowledge of the facts. Alternatively a court order requiring the registrar to cancel the restriction may be lodged.</p>

<p>There is no fee.</p>

<p>If all the registered proprietors have died, the personal representatives of the last surviving proprietor can make a similar application adjusting the terms of the statutory declaration, statement of truth or certificate according to the requirements of the case.</p>
