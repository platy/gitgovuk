<h2>Summary/key points</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (<abbr title="Foreign Influence Registration Scheme">FIRS</abbr>) has been introduced to the National Security Bill by government amendment. The overall aim of the 2-tier scheme is to deter foreign power use of covert arrangements, activities and proxies. It does this by requiring greater transparency around certain activities that foreign powers direct, as well as where those activities are directed or carried out by entities established overseas or subject to foreign power control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We continue to welcome open and transparent engagement from foreign governments and entities. This scheme will play a critical role in encouraging transparency, while simultaneously deterring foreign powers that wish to pursue their aims covertly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background - why do we need this amendment?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme is designed to strengthen the integrity of our politics and institutions and protect the UK from state threats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme’s aims are twofold, to strengthen the resilience of the UK political system against covert foreign influence and provide greater assurance around the activities of specified foreign powers or entities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The government is taking this step to ensure that the UK public and our democratic institutions are protected from covert influence and better informed as to the nature, scale and extent of foreign influence in our political affairs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme delivers a key recommendation of the Intelligence and Security Committee’s 2020 Russia Report.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How will the scheme work?</h2>

<h3>Registration of foreign influence arrangements and political influence activities carried out by foreign principals (the primary tier)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will require the registration of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>arrangements to carry out political influence activities within the UK at the direction of a foreign principal (foreign influence arrangement). The person making the arrangement with the foreign principal will be responsible for registering with the scheme</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>‘political influence activity’ where the activity is being carried out by the foreign principal itself. The foreign principal will be responsible for registering political influence activities</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A foreign principal is a foreign power or a foreign body corporate or association established outside of the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the scheme is to bring transparency to political influencing activity being done for a foreign power or entity, where the involvement of that foreign power or entity might otherwise not be apparent. As such, we would not expect other governments to register with the scheme in respect of influencing activity that they themselves are undertaking and “foreign powers” are therefore excluded from the second requirement above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Registerable ‘political influence activity’ includes making communications to senior decision makers such as UK ministers (and ministers of the devolved administrations), election candidates, MPs and senior civil servants. It also includes communications to the public where it is not already clear that the communications are being directed by a foreign principal, and disbursement of money, goods or services to UK persons. To be registerable, this activity has to be for the purpose of influencing UK public life for example elections, decisions of the government or the proceedings of either House of Parliament.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain information registered with this tier of the scheme will be made public (in accordance with the UK’s data protection legislation).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure the spirit of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, any arrangement with Ireland or with a body incorporated or associated under the laws of Ireland will be exempt from registration, as are activities to be carried out by such entities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be several foreign influence offences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>failure to register a foreign influence arrangement within 10 days of making the arrangement (where the person knows the arrangement is a foreign influence arrangement)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>carrying out political influence activity where the overarching arrangement is not registered and the person knows that the activity is being directed by a foreign principal</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>carrying out political influence activity where the person knows that information provided in connection with the arrangement is false, inaccurate or misleading</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>foreign principals carrying out unregistered political influence activity (this offence cannot be committed by a foreign power)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>providing false, inaccurate or misleading information during registration or in response to an information notice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>failing to comply with an information notice without reasonable excuse</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The penalties for a foreign influence offence are a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment, a fine or both.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration of foreign activity arrangements and activities carried out by a specified person (enhanced tier)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme contains a power for the Secretary of State to specify a foreign power, part of a foreign power or an entity subject to foreign power control where it is considered necessary for the safety and interests of the UK. The use of this power will be subject to Parliamentary approval. No entities have been specified in the Bill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will require the registration of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>arrangements to carry out any activity within the UK at the direction of a specified power or entity, as above (a foreign activity arrangement). The person making the arrangement with the specified body will be responsible for registering with the scheme</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>activity carried out by specified foreign power-controlled entities. The specified entity will be responsible for registering with the scheme. We will not require specified foreign governments to register with the scheme</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be several foreign activity offences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>failure to register a foreign activity arrangement within 10 days of making the arrangement (where the person knows the arrangement is a foreign activity arrangement)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>carrying out activity where the activity is not registered and the person knows that the activity has been directed by a specified person</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>carrying out activity where the person knows that information provided in connection with the arrangement is false, inaccurate or misleading</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>specified foreign power-controlled entities carrying out unregistered activity</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>knowingly providing false, inaccurate or misleading information during registration or in response to an information notice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>failing to comply with an information notice without reasonable excuse</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The penalties for a foreign activity offence are a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment, a fine or both.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What information will need to be registered with <abbr title="Foreign Influence Registration Scheme">FIRS</abbr>?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Secretary of State will make regulations at a later date detailing what information a person will need to register with the scheme. This will be subject to parliamentary approval. We intend that a person would have to register information such as who they are in an arrangement with, what activity they have been directed to undertake and when the arrangement was made. We will ensure the registration requirements are clear, simple and proportionate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are information notices?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Information notices can be given by the Secretary of State to request more information about registered arrangements or activities or where the Secretary of State reasonably believes that an arrangement or activity should have been registered. Information notices cannot be given to a foreign power.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How have you ensured the proportionality of the scheme?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The following will not be required to register with the scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>individuals acting for a foreign power in their official capacity as employees (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>individuals to whom privileges and immunities apply in international law as provided by, for example, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic and Consular Relations (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>family members who are part of the household of members of diplomatic and consular staff (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>provision of legal services (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>those providing essential services to a diplomatic mission or consulate e.g., catering or building services (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>domestic and international news publishers (primary tier)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>arrangements to which the UK is party (both tiers)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obligations in connection with the registration scheme do not affect legal professional privilege or require the disclosure of confidential journalistic material or sources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scheme will not impose undue costs upon businesses and individuals. For example, there will not be a fee for registration and individual employees of a company will not have to register for activity carried out acting in their capacity as an employee.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
