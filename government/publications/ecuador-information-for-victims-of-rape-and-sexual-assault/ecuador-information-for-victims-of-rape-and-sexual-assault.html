<p>If you have been sexually assaulted it is important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>The following information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is advisable to read the whole document to help you come to a decision on what to do next.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>First steps</h2>

<p>Firstly, and most importantly, make sure that you are as safe as you can be. If you are alone or with a stranger, do seek help from the police, a hospital, school or the British Embassy in Quito.</p>

<p>Evidence is important. You should try not to wash or shower, or to change or wash your clothes.</p>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact Ecuador´s emergency number: 911</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/ecuador">British Embassy Quito</a>
</li>
  <li>contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office´s Global Response Centre (24/7) for emergency assistance, outside working hours, through the British Embassy Quito’s switchboard (+593 (0)2 3972 200)</li>
</ul>

<p>The consular team will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in Ecuador</h3>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area where there is a British Embassy or consulate, they will try to send or put you in contact with a consular officer to support you.</p>

<p>You can approach the local police directly, by calling Freephone 1800 DELITO (335486) option 4 to report the incident, or contact the Police Investigation Unit Against Sexual Integrity (UNCIS), at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:uncis2021@gmail.com">uncis2021@gmail.com</a>. Alternatively, you can call 911 emergency services to provide you with immediate assistance and to put you in contact with a police officer to help you with the next steps. You can also ask them to inform the British Embassy.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the incident, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts. The police will keep any clothes, which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner.</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell the police if you think you may have been drugged</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable</li>
  <li>you probably will not find a female officer to talk to, however you can request one if one is available</li>
  <li>
    <p>if you decide to report the incident, you may want to go directly to the Public Prosecution Office (“Fiscalía”) to give your statement . You have the right to an interpreter free of charge (‘Perito traductor’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>alternatively, you can report the incident online with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/denuncia-en-linea-violencia-contra-la-mujer/" rel="external">Public Prosecutor Office</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The police can also help you seek medical treatment from a public hospital or medical centre. If you prefer, this can also be requested from a private hospital or clinic.</p>

<p>If you have first reported the incident to the Public Prosecutor Office (‘Fiscalía’), before seeking medical treatment, they will issue an official order for you to receive retroviral treatment for free from a public hospital. This should preferably be done within 72 hours after the incident. Alongside this, they will arrange a forensic examination (‘exámen médico legal’).</p>

<p>If you are under 18, you must be accompanied by an adult throughout the above process. This adult should be one of your parents or a guardian. If a state institution is responsible for you, they should appoint an adult to accompany you. The children’s safeguarding police unit (DINAPEN) may get involved due to their responsibility for supporting children and adolescents at risk.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor will lead on the investigation phase by engaging the police. A judicial case file will be opened. If you want to formalise your report (‘Denuncia’), you will need to testify (‘Testimonio Anticipado’) before the Judge and Prosecutor. However, this will be led by an official psychologist through a video-recorded interview, to be used for a court proceeding (‘Etapa de Juicio’). In principle, this testimony has to be taken in the same district jurisdiction where the incident took place.</p>

<p>You will be expected to provide a description of the attacker and information on when and where the incident took place.</p>

<p>If you report the case within 24 hours of the incident, or the perpetrator gets caught in the act, the case will be fast-tracked via the ’flagrancia’ system. Under a flagrant offence, the judicial process will be completed within 30 days. You will not have to surrender your passport whilst any investigation is carried out. They would take a copy of it.</p>

<p>If you are in the area of the British Embassy, a consular officer may be able to accompany you to report the case, either to the police station or to the Fiscalía. If you are outside Quito, you can contact the British Embassy´s consular team, and if applicable, they can put you in contact with their British Honorary Consulates in Guayaquil, Cuenca or Santa Cruz Galapagos Island.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reporting the incident in Ecuador - what happens next</h2>

<p>The Prosecutor will review your case and may request the judge to call a hearing (‘Audiencia de Formulación de Cargos’) to establish if there is sufficient evidence to press charges. If so, firstly through a 90 or maximum 120 days judicial process (‘Instrucción Fiscal’) and if relevant for a trial process (‘Etapa de Juicio’), which can take between 6 months to 1 year.</p>

<p>Be aware that a ‘non-revictimsation’ policy is in place in Ecuador. This means that the Public Prosecutor or other officials should not ask you to repeat your statement or any personal information. However, bear in mind that you will still need to give your statement at two different stages: during the preliminary investigation phase (‘Indagación Previa’) and at the criminal judicial process stage (‘Instrucción Fiscal’).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>The medical examination - what to expect</h2>

<p>In principle all public hospitals/health centres with an emergency service in Ecuador treat victims of rape and sexual assault, through their First Care Rooms (‘Salas de Primera Acogida/Atención’). The staff in these centres are specially trained to provide this assistance. A medical evaluation and psychological support should be accessible to victims (through the activation of ‘código purpura’), regardless of whether you want to report the incident to the police/prosecutor.</p>

<p>These reports (‘informe pericial’) will be included in any official report. Please note that all public and private health officials are obliged to report the cases to the Public Prosecutor Office (‘Fiscalía’).</p>

<p>If you decide to report the incident, the Public Prosecutor (‘Fiscal’) will order a comprehensive sexual offence report (‘Informe Forense de Delito Sexual’) which includes a gynaecological/forensic examination (‘exámen médico legal’), ideally within 48 hours, and a psychological assessment. Both examinations are an important part of the evidence gathering process and are free of charge. Only official-appointed forensic experts (‘Perito - Médico Legista’) should do these from the Public Prosecution Office. Exemptions are applied for victims who are children.</p>

<p>The British Embassy’s consular team can accompany you to the relevant healthcare facility for a medical check. Likewise, we can help you to arrange an appointment with a private doctor to give you advice on sexual transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS, and pregnancy or abortion. They have a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals--2">English speaking medical practitioners</a> available.</p>

<p>In addition, you may wish to speak to a private counsellor or psychologist. The British Embassy can also help you with this. Alternatively, and with your consent, we can signpost you to a local support agency to provide you with psychological, social and legal advice free of charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Treatment</h3>

<p>To prevent unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, retroviral kits are available at public health centres offering 24 hours emergency service (‘Sala de Primera Acogida o de Atención’). The emergency contraceptive and a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment is accessible to victims, which needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. This may stop HIV replicating in the body and so prevent the virus from attacking the immune system.  The retroviral treatment may be also prescribed by a private doctor, who will provide you with relevant information about its side effects. You will have to cover the relevant costs.</p>

<p>More information on risks is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/" rel="external">NHS</a> website. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 days treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>If you have first reported the incident to the Public Prosecutor, before seeking medical treatment, they will issue an official order for you to receive the above retroviral treatment free from a public hospital.</p>

<p>Should you prefer to get full treatment in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals--2">local private hospital or clinic</a>, you will have to cover all the costs for the medical attention and tests. If you have travel insurance, these costs may be refunded when back in the UK, by keeping all the relevant invoices and medical certificates.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered in Ecuador, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Police investigations in Ecuador - what to expect</h2>

<p>The Ecuadorean National Police has available an Investigation Unit Against Sexual Integrity (UNCIS – ‘Unidad de Investigación contra la Integridad Sexual’). They can be contacted at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:uncis2021@gmail.com">uncis2021@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>The Police has in place the Community Police Units (UPC - ‘Unidades de Policía Comunitaria’) throughout Ecuador, which victims can approach to report what happened and to ask for protection. As part of their remit, UPC officials can help liaising protection measures, such as ‘Boleta de Auxilio’ (a restraining order) with the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>If you report the incident within 24 hours of its occurring, or if the police catch the perpetrator in the act, the case will qualify as a flagrant offence (‘flagrancia’). The Public Prosecutor Office (‘Fiscalía’) has available 24/7 ‘flagrant units’ to take formal <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fiscalia.gob.ec/unidades-de-flagrancias-de-la-fiscalia-general-del-estado/" rel="external">reports</a>.</p>

<p>The police can take the victim to the scene of the incident, or where the victim thinks the attacker is located to try to identify and arrest the person, but this is &nbsp;only if the victims gives consent to this action. If a suspect is brought to the police station or public prosecutor (‘Fiscal’) as part of the investigation, the victim will be asked to make an identification.</p>

<p>The judicial process for a flagrant offence should be completed within 30 days. If you want to formalise your report, you will need to testify (‘Testimonio Anticipado’) before the Prosecutor and Judge, but this will be led by an official psychologist through a video-recorded interview to be used for a court proceeding. In principle, this testimony has to be taken in the same district jurisdiction where the event took place. However, from the pandemic “virtual” means have been significantly utilised, both for hearings and/or judicial proceedings. You will be allowed to leave the country even if your case is not filed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Court procedures - what to expect</h2>

<p>Once you have reported the incident to the authorities, and your statement and the required examinations have been undertaken, the Public Prosecution Office (‘Fiscalía’) will review your case before bringing it to a Criminal Court (‘Unidad Judicial’). The investigation (‘indagación’) can take up to 12 months.</p>

<p>You will be appointed with a pro bono lawyer/public defendant (‘Defensor Público’) or you will have the choice to appoint a private lawyer. However, few public defendants may speak English. The British Embassy can provide you with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-lawyers">list of English speaking private lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor may request the judge to call a hearing (‘Audiencia de Formulación de Cargos’) to establish whether or not there is sufficient evidence to press charges. If the judge determines that the incident was a criminal offence (‘delito’) a judicial process (‘instrucción fiscal’) will begin, and can last up to 90 days. This may be exceptionally extended to 120 days. Following this, the judge will decide whether to call for a trial process or not.</p>

<p>In normal circumstances, a trial process (‘etapa de juicio’) can take between 6 months to 1 year. At this stage, be aware that although you will have provided your official statement (‘Testimonio Anticipado’) that you may be requested to attend a court hearing (‘Audiencia de Juzgamiento’).</p>

<p>If the case is referred for further investigation, you may be asked to give an additional statement. Be aware that a “no-revictimisation” policy is in place in Ecuador. This means that the prosecutor or other officials should not ask you to repeat your statement or any personal information. However, do bear in mind that you will still need to give your statement at two different stages: during the preliminary investigation phase (‘Indagación Previa’) and at the criminal judicial process stage (‘Instrucción Fiscal’).</p>

<p>It is not mandatory for you to hire a private lawyer, you can request a pro- bono lawyer (‘defensor público’) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defensoria.gob.ec/?page_id=22777" rel="external">‘Defensoría Pública’</a>.</p>

<p>As of February 2019, crimes of a sexual assault in nature are imprescriptible, meaning that there is no longer any time limit to make a formal police report.</p>

<p>Once the judicial process has started it will continue, even if you have left Ecuador, as it is the Public Prosecutor´s (‘Fiscalía’) obligation to investigate the incident. If you wish you can appoint a local representative (lawyer, relative or any person you trust) to act on your behalf while you are outside of Ecuador. To do this you will have to sign a Power of Attorney (‘Poder Judicial’). If you prepare this from the UK it needs to be legalised (apostilled) and translated into Spanish.</p>

<p>Your representative will be able to ask the authorities for details and updates on your case and to submit or make requests to the judge. You are entitled to be kept informed of your case even when you are back in the UK. In principle, any correspondence will be sent to your email address you provided to the court.</p>

<p>If a suspect is ordered to trial, you may be expected to testify in court, without coming back to Ecuador, potentially through a straightforward video conference or through an ‘International Criminal Assistance’ request via Skype (but only if you have not already given a ‘Testimonio Anticipado’).</p>

<p>If you change your mind about pressing charges, or you are not sure if you want to continue, you can retract your statement. To do this you must tell the state prosecutor (‘Fiscalía’). However, do bear in mind that the charge of rape may be an automatic state prosecution led by the Fiscalía (‘de oficio’).</p>

<p>Compensation for the victim is usually included in the assailant´s sentence once the case has finished. Your lawyer will guide you on the level of compensation to claim for and how to submit this before the trial. As a foreign national, you are entitled to get an official translator (‘Perito Traductor’), which will be provided by the court at no cost. If for any reason this is not in place, any court hearing should be delayed until this is arranged.</p>

<p>Consular staff will not normally be able to attend the trial with you, but due to your vulnerability they can accompany you as observers Alternatively, you may wish to be accompanied by a friend or member of your family for the court hearing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Trial procedures</h3>

<p>Ecuadorean judicial procedures can be lengthy and drawn out especially if your assailant is not immediately identifiable and/or arrested soon after the incident. An investigating judge is principally in charge of leading the investigation into the incident. At the end of the investigation phase when all necessary reports and statements have been completed the judge in charge of the investigation and the state prosecutor will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial. In which case, the case will be passed to a trial court and will be presided over by three judges.</p>

<p>The Ecuadorean authorities will notify you of the trial date via your personal or lawyer’s email. If you are in the UK, and you are not correctively notified, the judge will cancel the trial and schedule a new date only if your presence in the hearing is needed.</p>

<p>The trial will be conducted in Spanish and you will be provided with an official interpreter (‘Perito Intérprete/Traductor’). You should also be accompanied by your private or state-appointed lawyer. Please note that there is usually no simultaneous interpretation. You have the right, though, to raise your concerns over a non-satisfactory translation during the hearing, through your lawyer or directly with the Judge.</p>

<p>Cases can take years to come to trial, as the Ecuadorean court system is very slow and also due to workload issues. If you have not heard anything from the court for some time, this does not necessarily mean that the case has been shelved. The length of the trial itself can also vary depending on the complexity. You will have the right to raise officially your concerns over unacceptable delays in a judicial process, through your lawyer or through the British Consulate, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>The trial is normally held in front of three judges who have access to all the information beforehand. The length of the trial depends on the complexity of the case but can be as little as a day or a few hours. If the hearing takes too long, the judge can decide to postpone it for another day, but within a week maximum. Only the judge can put a new date.</p>

<p>You will only have to be present when you give evidence or testify if it is necessary.</p>

<p>You will not receive notification of the verdict straight away. More likely, you will be notified in writing at a later date, through your lawyer.</p>

<p>If convicted the assailant has right of appeal against the length of the sentence which can take months to be resolved.</p>

<p>Once convicted, the offender may be ordered to pay financial aid and amounts awarded as compensation or damages, which will be published in the same sentence document. There will be no right to appeal. If compensation payments are not fulfilled, you have the right to pursue an additional proceeding for the accomplishment of a sentence order (‘proceso para ejecución de sentencia’). Your lawyer will be able to guide you on the best viable options.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Sentencing</h3>

<p>Sentences in Ecuador are ruled by the principle of social rehabilitation programmes. However, this is now a voluntary option in prisons.</p>

<p>Sex offences are generally punishable with a prison sentence and its duration will depend on the classification of the offence (sexual abuse, rape…).</p>

<p>If the alleged perpetrator is found ‘not guilty’, there will be no criminal responsibility. However, during the investigation phase of the proceedings, and if the alleged perpetrator is not remanded to prison, certain provisional measures could be applied for, such as a restraining order.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<p>A private lawyer will represent your interests before the court and is able to present a private prosecution in parallel to the state prosecution. See here <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-lawyers">list of English speaking private lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>A lawyer should be able to access the pre-trial information held by the court including the statements provided by the defendant.</p>

<p>If you cannot hire a private lawyer, you are entitled for a state-appointed lawyer through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.defensoria.gob.ec/?page_id=22777" rel="external">‘Defensoría Pública’</a>, which are available throughout Ecuador. They have a Victims Unit available, specialised to provide assistance to victims of rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse.</p>

<p>Be aware that few of these pro-bono lawyers (‘Defensor Público’) speak English, especially in small towns.</p>

<p>Some NGOs or local government funded organisations provide free legal advice. See contact details below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Ecuador</h3>

<p>The British Embassy’s consular team will be able to help you. This includes helping you arrange to contact your insurance company, and if you want, also your family and/or friends. We can provide you with lists of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals--2">medical facilities</a>,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-hospitals--2">English speaking doctors</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-lawyers">lawyers</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ecuador-list-of-translators-and-interpreters">translators</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to travel back to the UK, we can help you with information on local support available to you in the UK upon your return.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to them and ask for relevant assistance. Where possible, and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>If you do not report the incident to the local police, you will not have to go through the forensic examinations, but you will still be able to get medical attention. A consular officer from the British Embassy in Quito can accompany you to a healthcare facility for this purpose, or if you are outside Quito, we can provide you with further details on the medical facilities in your area.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h3>

<p>You do not have to report an assault to the Ecuadorean police if you do not want to, but it is usually better to report the crime whilst in Ecuador to make it easier for the Ecuadorean police to start the investigation and for legal action to be taken against the assailant.</p>

<p>It is possible to report the incident to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate an incident in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate incidents committed overseas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed, and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the incident locally in Ecuador.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a> after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information.</p>
