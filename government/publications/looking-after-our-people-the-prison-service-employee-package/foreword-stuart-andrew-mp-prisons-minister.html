<p>We owe our staff a huge debt of gratitude for ensuring that prisons are safe, rehabilitative places, supporting offenders to live crime-free lives on release.</p>

<p>Even during the pandemic, HMPPS employees demonstrated why they are some of our finest public servants by going above and beyond to carry out their duties in such uncertain times.</p>

<p>As the work of prison staff is, by its very nature, largely out of view from the public they serve, they are often hidden heroes who do not always get the recognition they deserve.</p>

<p>But for the offenders who are encouraged to take part in drug programmes, enrol in educational courses or simply open up about their poor life choices, the work of our staff is crucial. It makes a real difference.</p>

<p>And ultimately, it makes our streets safer when they turn over a new leaf instead of reoffending.</p>

<p>As Prisons Minister, I am committed to ensuring that our staff feel valued and supported to develop a long and fulfilling career within HMPPS. That’s why we are launching this ‘Looking after our people’ tool, which is an easy to navigate document that sets out our overall employment package to staff.</p>

<p>From learning and development and career progression&nbsp;to staff discounts, there is so much that makes up our employee offer. By using this tool, current and aspiring employees will be able to review the full range of benefits available to them and see a snapshot of the work that is underway behind the scenes to develop our offer further.</p>

<p>While working in a prison is one of the toughest jobs there is, there are few that can be as important or rewarding –- something which is evident throughout this document.</p>
