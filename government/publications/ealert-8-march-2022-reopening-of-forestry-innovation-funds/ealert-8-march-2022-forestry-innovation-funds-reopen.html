<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Forestry Innovation Funds reopen</h2>
<p>The Tree Production Innovation Fund (<abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr>) and Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) Forestry Innovation Funds are now open for applications.</p>

<p>This year almost £4.5 million will be allocated to successful applicants across both funds, which together will boost nature regeneration efforts, promote biodiversity, and support innovative approaches to tree health, resilience and production amidst a changing climate. Investing in the long-term welfare of our forests will underpin wider efforts to treble tree planting rates by the end of this Parliament and plant 30,000 hectares of trees across the UK per year by 2025.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tree-resilience-efforts-boosted-as-funds-to-improve-forestry-innovation-reopen">Read a summary in our latest press release</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Woods into Management Forestry Innovation Funds</h3>
<p>Approximately 40% of England’s woodlands are not actively managed, which can be detrimental to biodiversity and leave neglected woodlands vulnerable to pests and disease. Projects which successfully apply for funding through the second round of the Woods into Management Forestry Innovation Funds will receive a share of £3 million, as the Forestry Commission aims to bring an additional 20,000 hectares of existing woodland in England into active management by 2024/25.</p>

<p>Under the umbrella of the Woods into Management (<abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr>) Forestry Innovation Funds, the new Timber in Construction Innovation Fund will support projects which increase and facilitate the use of English timber from sustainably managed woods and forests in construction. Other funds will support new business models and supply chains for ash timber to help restore woodlands damaged by ash dieback, as well as for initiatives using temporary infrastructure to access neglected or degraded woodlands. Moreover, a series of regional funds will support innovative projects that enable the active management of woodlands where previously not possible.</p>

<p>Applicants in the forestry and associated sectors, as well as local authorities, will be invited to submit multi-year proposals spanning up to three financial years (ending March 2025), with individual projects valued at up to £100,000 per year.</p>

<p>Applications for the <abbr title="Woods into Management">WiM</abbr> Forestry Innovation Funds are now open until 23:55 on Monday 9 May 2022.</p>

<p>The Forestry Commission will be hosting a series of Woods into Management webinar events on Thursday 24 March. During these sessions, applicants will have the opportunity to ask questions about the Forestry Innovation Fund application and evaluation processes. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/woods-into-management-forestry-innovation-funds">More details of these can be found on our website</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Tree Production Innovation Fund</h3>
<p>Also reopening today, the Tree Production Innovation Fund (<abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr>) will make over £1.4 million available to projects striving to enhance the quantity, quality, and diversity of tree planting stock available for planting in England. The Fund will support the research and development of new technologies and ways of working which will supply young trees in the quantities required to realise ambitious tree planting plans across the country. Projects previously supported with this fund include collaborations from researchers, nurseries, seed suppliers and industry, including the Future Trees Trust, the University of Oxford and Maelor Forest Nurseries. Applicants will be invited to submit multi-year proposals spanning up to three financial years (ending March 2025), with projects valued at up to £300,000 per year.</p>

<p>Applications for the <abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr> are now open until 23:55 on Wednesday 11 May 2022.</p>

<p>The Forestry Commission will be hosting a <abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr> webinar event at 14:00 on Friday 25 March. During this session, applicants will have the opportunity to ask questions about the <abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr> application and evaluation processes. If you would like to attend please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:TPIF@forestrycommission.gov.uk"><abbr title="Tree Production Innovation Fund">TPIF</abbr>@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Celebrating the women working in the Forestry Commission</h2>
<p>Today we are celebrating International Women’s Day with a blog to celebrate the women working in the Forestry Commission written by Georgi Ennis one of our Woodland Officer’s covering South Hampshire and Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Hear from Georgi, and other women in the Forestry Commission, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forestrycommission.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/08/celebrating-the-women-working-in-the-forestry-commission-georgi-ennis/" rel="external">this week on our blog</a>.</p>

<p>Georgi Ennis, Woodland Officer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The community of women arborists, tree officers, scientists etc. are amazing. You never feel overwhelmed, it’s always an enjoyable and educational environment. There is so much more to forestry and arboriculture than just ‘cutting trees’.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Ips typographus and the risk from storm damage: action required</h2>
<p>All landowners, managers and timber processors should remain vigilant for Ips typographus, and it is important to take the necessary action now, to rapidly remove storm damaged trees in their area.</p>

<p>With significant storm damage reported across the South East of England this winter, spruce trees are likely to have fallen or snapped in the storms. This significantly increases the chances of an establishment of Ips typographus occurring in spring if another flight occurs from the continent. We recommend that spruce be walked in March, with fallen or snapped trees identified and destroyed where possible.</p>

<p>Advice on suitable methods of destruction is available on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eight-toothed-european-spruce-bark-beetle-ips-typographus#storm-damage-action-required">Ips typographus guidance page</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Making space for nature – to benefit water</h2>
<p>One of our latestest blog post looks into the benefits that watercourses can have on your land.</p>

<p>Planting a new woodland across slopes or beside a river can help to intercept run-off and greatly reduce pollution from entering nearby waterways.</p>

<p>There is grant support available to assist you with your water goals: you could receive additional Forestry Commission grant contributions up to £2,500/ha for improving water quality, flood management and creating woodland along rivers on your land through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/england-woodland-creation-offer">England Woodland Creation Offer</a>.</p>
