<span class="number">7. </span>Information: join the Teaching Regulation Agency’s Professional Conduct Panel</h2>

<p>The Department for Education is currently recruiting teacher panellists for the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) Professional Conduct Panel (PCP).</p>

<p>We want to recruit around 50 serving, or recently serving teachers.</p>

<p>Successful applicants will be required to sit as one of 3 PCP panellists to consider allegations of serious misconduct referred to the Secretary of State by employers, the police, the Disclosure and Barring Service, other regulators, other interested organisations, and members of the public. The PCP will consider the evidence and determine whether the facts in the case are proven and if it amounts to unacceptable professional conduct, conduct that brings the profession into disrepute and/or conviction of a relevant offence. The PCP will make recommendations to the Secretary of State as to whether a teacher should be prohibited from teaching.</p>

<p>This role will suit those teachers who have experience in dealing with investigations into school procedures, systems and processes and those with experience in pastoral roles. The position will most likely suit senior school leaders, heads of department and teachers with responsibilities such as Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCO) and/or Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs). Applications from classroom teachers with the necessary skills and experience from outside of their current teaching role would also be welcomed.</p>

<p>For <a rel="external" href="https://publicappointments.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/appointment/teaching-regulation-agency-professional-conduct-panel-teacher-panellist/" class="govuk-link">more information on this vacancy please read the post online</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying for or would like any more information on this vacancy, please contact the Panellist Recruitment Team at <a href="mailto:TRA.RECRUITMENT@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">TRA.RECRUITMENT@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
