<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: central school services block (CSSB) – historic commitments protection</h2>

<p>You will be aware that from 2020 to 2021 we began to reduce the historic commitments element within CSSB funding that some local authorities receive. This is in line with our reforms to move to a fairer funding system, and to avoid maintaining significant differences in funding indefinitely between local authorities which reflect historic decisions.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, for those local authorities that receive it, historic commitments funding will continue to reduce by 20% on 2021 to 2022 allocations, the same rate as the reduction in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>We will also continue to protect any local authority from having a reduction that takes their total historic commitments funding below the total value of their ongoing prudential borrowing and termination of employment costs, in recognition of the long lead-in times required for such costs to unwind.</p>

<p>We ask that local authorities who believe they qualify for this protection write to us with evidence (anonymised pensions data and/or contracts for prudential borrowing) by no later than 1 February 2022 at <a href="mailto:fundingpolicy.queries@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">fundingpolicy.queries@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will consider the evidence local authorities submit and, where applicable, we will make these exceptional adjustments for 2022 to 2023 in the March 2022 dedicated school grant allocations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: 2022 to 2023 high needs place change notification process closing</h2>

<p>The high needs place change notification process for 2022 to 2023 closes on Friday, 12 November 2021.</p>

<p>Local authorities should confirm their 2022 to 2023 high needs place numbers in ESFA funded schools and colleges by this date via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://efadatacollections.education.gov.uk/lafr/SitePages/Home.aspx">ESFA data collections portal</a>.</p>

<p>We have published guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">high needs place change process</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance" class="govuk-link">how to complete the high needs place change workbook</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities should also make requests for changes to hospital education funding through the place change workbook.

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: join the Teaching Regulation Agency’s Professional Conduct Panel</h2>

<p>The Department for Education is currently recruiting teacher panellists for the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) Professional Conduct Panel (PCP).</p>

<p>We want to recruit around 50 serving, or recently serving teachers.</p>

<p>Successful applicants will be required to sit as one of 3 PCP panellists to consider allegations of serious misconduct referred to the Secretary of State by employers, the police, the Disclosure and Barring Service, other regulators, other interested organisations, and members of the public. The PCP will consider the evidence and determine whether the facts in the case are proven and if it amounts to unacceptable professional conduct, conduct that brings the profession into disrepute and/or conviction of a relevant offence. The PCP will make recommendations to the Secretary of State as to whether a teacher should be prohibited from teaching.</p>

<p>This role will suit those teachers who have experience in dealing with investigations into school procedures, systems and processes and those with experience in pastoral roles. The position will most likely suit senior school leaders, heads of department and teachers with responsibilities such as Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCO) and/or Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs). Applications from classroom teachers with the necessary skills and experience from outside of their current teaching role would also be welcomed.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://publicappointments.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/appointment/teaching-regulation-agency-professional-conduct-panel-teacher-panellist/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">more information on this vacancy please read the post online</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying for or would like any more information on this vacancy, please contact the Panellist Recruitment Team at <a href="mailto:TRA.RECRUITMENT@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">TRA.RECRUITMENT@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
