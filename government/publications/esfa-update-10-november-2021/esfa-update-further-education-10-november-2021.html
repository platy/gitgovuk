<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: College Collaboration Fund (CCF) – insight report publication</h2>

<p>The second round of the College Collaboration Fund (CCF) is well underway. Colleges are working collaboratively on delivering their quality improvement projects and sharing good practice, including that developed through new ways of working. As part of their programme of work, colleges are producing resources that are available for the wider FE sector to access. These can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-collaboration-fund-ccf-projects/resources-college-collaboration-fund-ccf">CCF GOV.UK page</a> and this will be continually updated as new resources become available.</p>

<p>On 5 November, the department published the first thematic ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/college-collaboration-fund-ccf-insight-report">Insight Report</a>’ to support sharing of the learning generated by the first round of the CCF. This short report focusses on the development of digital curriculum content and presents ‘top tips’ and case studies drawn from those projects who have produced new digital content. Further reports will be published as part of the department’s approach to sharing with FE leaders and practitioners the insights, learning and good practice from all the colleges involved in both rounds of the CCF.</p>

<p>We would strongly encourage colleges to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/college-collaboration-fund-ccf">access the learning, resources and support on GOV.UK</a> that has become available through the CCF programme.</p>

<p>For further information please contact the team through the dedicated mailbox: <a href="mailto:College.CollaborationFund@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">College.CollaborationFund@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
