<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>DfE Sign-in</h3>

<h4>Sign in to your DfE Sign-in account</h4>

<p>Please try your DfE Sign-in credentials as soon as possible, to avoid any issues with submitting your form.</p>

<p>After checking your credentials, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/workforce-fund-claim" rel="external">coronavirus (COVID-19) workforce fund for schools and colleges claim form</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign in to DfE Sign-in, using your account username and password.</li>
  <li>If you are part of an FE college and have more than one eligible campus, choose the individual campus you want to complete the form for.</li>
  <li>The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you logged in. This will show the name, address, and unique reference number (URN) or UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who accessed DfE Sign-in.</li>
  <li>If these details are correct, select ‘continue’ to move to the next page.</li>
  <li>If you think your details are incorrect or you are experiencing issues accessing the form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a> and we will investigate.</li>
  <li>Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation you are completing the form for.</p>

<p>You do not need to add any services in your DfE Sign-in account. It is used for authentication only, and the form will not appear in your list of services.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For FE providers with individual campus IDs, you will need to select the campus ID which you are registering interest for.</p>
</div>

<h4>If you do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h4>
<p>You will need to create one:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘create account’ button.</li>
  <li>Enter your name and email address (use your work email address or one that is clearly associated with your organisation).</li>
  <li>We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</li>
  <li>Create a memorable password of 8 characters, which must include 2 upper case characters, 2 lower case characters and 2 numbers.</li>
  <li>Sign in using your new credentials, select ‘organisations’ and then ‘request an organisation’, enter the URN or name of your establishment. The request will be sent to the DfE Sign-in approver for the establishment, to approve your request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might have noticed the term ‘approver’ when creating your account. An approver is someone at your organisation responsible for controlling who has access to DfE Sign-in, and the services within the system. It’s usually a senior person, such as an administrator or manager.</p>

<p>Once your request to access an organisation has been approved, you can follow the steps outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sign-in-to-your-DfE-Sign-in-account">sign in to your DfE Sign-in account</a> to complete the form.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisation’s approvers before you can access the form.</p>

<h4>If you need further assistance</h4>

<p>If you are having problems using the DfE Sign-in service, use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact" rel="external">DfE Sign-in help service</a>. You will be able to request further assistance if required. When raising a support request, select ‘other’.</p>

<p>If you believe you are eligible to claim but have problems accessing the form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Completing the form</h2>

<p>There is no save facility on the form, so have all the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-workforce-fund-for-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-workforce-fund-guidance#before-you-start">information and evidence</a> ready before starting a claim. If your claim form is open for an extended period, you may lose any information entered to that point, and will need to sign in again.</p>

<p>You will be presented with several pages asking you to complete information related to staff absences and associated costs you are claiming, followed by a prompt to complete the required declarations and an explanation of what will happen once you have submitted the form.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Selecting ‘continue’ on each page will take you through the form.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Your details</h3>

<p>This page will display the details we hold about your setting.  It will also confirm the credentials you have used to access DfE Sign-in.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Financial eligibility</h3>
<p>This page will determine if your setting has met the financial eligibility criteria. Eligibility is based on your remaining annual financial reserves and you will only be able to proceed with your claim if you’re an eligible setting and have selected the declaration box.</p>

<p>You can read more about financial eligibility at:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Consent</h3>
<p>To complete this form, you will need to provide figures for staff on roll and staff absences. However, if you have been completing the educational setting status form, we already hold this data for the claim period until 4 March 2022, and can use the figures you’ve already provided to pre-populate these fields.</p>

<p>From 7 March 2022, the education setting status form moved to weekly data collection, so you will need to input any absences from 7 March to 8 April 2022 manually.</p>

<p>In this section, you are asked to give us permission to use data provided on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/index.jsp" rel="external">educational setting status form</a> to pre-populate fields where possible.</p>

<p>If you select ‘yes’, the form will use data you have provided on the educational setting status form and if you have selected ‘no’ or are not presented with this question as pre-population of any data held is not possible, you will have to enter staff data in all fields within the form.</p>

<p>Please be aware that the answer given here cannot be subsequently amended or reversed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Statutory weekend provision</h3>

<p>This question enables you to claim for weekends if your setting was open for statutory education provision,  so that you can claim for all the eligible days your setting was open.</p>

<p>Answer ‘yes’ to this question if your setting was open on one or more weekends for statutory education provision (for example, residential special schools). The claim form will then include weekends in your staff absence data return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Closed days: November 2021 to April 2022</h3>
<p>Next, you will be asked to indicate which days your setting has been closed. This is so that closed days do not break your eligibility for consecutive days of absence when compared to the relevant absence thresholds.</p>

<p>You must include any days your setting has been closed during the period from 1 November 2021 to 8 April 2022. This includes inset days and any other days where your institution was not offering statutory provision (for example, half term, bank holidays or following <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> advice).</p>

<p>We are requesting November 2021 information as absence rates experienced in November 2021 count towards the long-term absence threshold criteria from 22 November 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Staff on roll</h3>
<p>If you have been asked and provided your consent, this section will have been pre-populated with the number of permanent staff on roll within your setting from the educational setting data we hold.</p>

<p>It is important for you to check this information against your own data, to ensure it indicates the right number of staff being on roll. If the data is incorrect you can amend it where necessary. If this section is not pre-populated, you will have to enter the requested data manually.</p>

<h4>Eligible staff</h4>
<p>When referring to support staff absences, we expect this to include both educational and non-educational support staff.</p>

<p>Educational support staff: we expect this may include teaching assistants or specialist support staff where they are necessary in remaining open to all pupils or fulfilling a legal duty.</p>

<p>Non-educational support staff: this may include cleaning, catering, transport or caretaking staff where these are necessary in remaining open to all pupils or fulfilling a legal duty.</p>

<p>In special schools or alternative provision (AP) settings, this may also include therapists and other support staff in health-related roles.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do not include any supply or agency staff.</p>
</div>

<p>This will help us baseline your absence figures with the applicable thresholds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Teaching staff absences: November 2021 to April 2022</h3>
<p>In this section, you will be presented with days your organisation was open for statutory education so that you can claim against staff absence for all eligible days.</p>

<p>Record all teacher absences, including school leaders if applicable, so that you can claim for all eligible days from 1 November 2021 to 8 April 2022. We will calculate the percentage of absence based on the number of teachers, including school leaders if applicable, you have on roll.</p>

<p>We are requesting November 2021 information as absence rates experienced in November 2021 count towards the long-term absence threshold criteria from 22 November 2021.</p>

<p>If you have been asked and provided your consent, this section will be pre-populated with daily teacher absence figures, including school leaders if applicable, within your setting from the educational setting data we hold.</p>

<p>It is important for you to check this information against your own data, to ensure it indicates the correct numbers. If the data is incorrect you can amend it where necessary. If this section is not pre-populated, you will have to enter the requested data manually.</p>

<p>Full details of the workforce absence rate criteria are outlined in:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.8 </span>Claims for teachers, including school leaders if applicable, absences</h3>
<p>The form will show the days between 22 November 2021 to 8 April 2022 met the workforce absence thresholds, based on the data provided earlier in the form.</p>

<p>It will also identify the cost equivalent in teachers, including school leaders if applicable, that you can claim.</p>

<p>You do not have to make a claim for any or all days that qualify. In such instances, please put in a zero. The fields cannot be left blank.</p>
