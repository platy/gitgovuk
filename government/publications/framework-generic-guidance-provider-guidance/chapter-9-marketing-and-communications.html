<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. The purpose of this section is to provide a general guide to marketing and communications for participants. It also aims to help you understand the minimum expectations for communicating your service standards to participants as part of the provision you have been contracted to deliver.</p>

<p>2. There are references and links to other sites containing more detailed information about marketing for government funded services. This guidance sits alongside that information, highlighting the main issues to be considered in any draft marketing products or media activity.</p>

<h2>Planning your marketing, communications and public relations (<abbr title="Public relations">PR</abbr>) activity</h2>

<p>3. As a contracted supplier of Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) we would encourage you to share your own marketing and <abbr title="Public relations">PR</abbr> activity with Jobcentre Plus. This is to achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complementary timing of activities</li>
  <li>consistency of message</li>
  <li>an understanding with all audiences how the activity you are delivering for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> fits into our wider picture</li>
</ul>

<p>4. This will ensure that both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and providers are able to maximise the value of their communications.</p>

<p>5. You may be required to share and agree your communication/marketing and publicity plans with the relevant Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact. However, for the purposes of European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funded provision (England only) you must ensure that your marketing plans and products comply with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> publicity requirements. You must clear these with your Jobcentre Plus group <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> team. (Generic Guidance Chapter 11 – <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Requirements).</p>

<p>6. As you are best placed to know the demographics of your local area, it is up to you to decide the best way to promote and describe your services in relation to the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Programme.</p>

<p>7. It is up to you to decide what types of products, activities and channels you want to use to market or communicate your services to prospective participants. However, you must, as a minimum, provide your organisation name, address, contact details, Jobcentre Plus logo and appropriate relationship endorsement wording. Information on how to apply the Jobcentre Plus logo and endorsement can be found in the Communication Standards for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Providers. Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://communicationcentre.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">‘Our Brands’</a> to register with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communication Centre and view the Communication Standards document.</p>

<p>8. All the marketing products you produce must adhere to the standards, as written in your contract, and within this guidance. These standards are in place in order to protect the integrity of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes and the reputation of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>9. In addition, providers delivering services funded by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> or match must also follow <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> specific marketing and publicity requirements. Further information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/european-social-fund-publicity-toolkit">European Social Fund publicity toolkit</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance">Generic Guidance Chapter 11 <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Requirements</a>.</p>

<p>10. These standards apply to all information sharing, press activity and marketing products or activities that you undertake.</p>

<p>11. There may be times when you will need to change aspects of your marketing plans. For example, you would need to be flexible on timing, if there is a clash which could lead to confusion for the target audience. Or you might need to incorporate ministerial involvement in <abbr title="Public relations">PR</abbr> activity. However, establishing close working relationships with your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact should minimise any negative impacts.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>12. Any material you produce specifically for marketing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programmes must make reference to the specific <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> programme you are delivering and clearly show that it is a government programme.</p>

<p>13. You should introduce what participants on the programme may receive, and include wording to describe what the programme will deliver.</p>

<p>14. If you are delivering an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded programme or matched, you will need to ensure your products also meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-generic-guidance-provider-guidance"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Requirements</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>

<p>15. Some key issues you must consider for the content of your marketing, communications and press activity are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reputational risk – materials you produce must not adversely affect the reputation of the service being provided by the government, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or Jobcentre Plus, for example risks that could lead to adverse media attention, or messages that could be misunderstood or misinterpreted</li>
  <li>Disability Equality Duty/Equality Act 2010 – you must ensure that all our participants can access our information by:
    <ul>
      <li>providing a variety of alternative formats (for example, large print, audio format, Braille) on request</li>
      <li>ensuring that people can still access our information when their chosen alternative format is not available</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More information about delivering inclusive communications is available from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication">Office for Disability Issues</a>.</p>

<h2>Communication standards</h2>

<p>16. Please visit ‘Our Brands’ to register with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communication Centre and view the Communication Standards document.</p>

<h2>Basic conventions</h2>

<p>17. In producing your marketing material, you must be aware that there are propriety conventions that you will have to follow. Adhering to these conventions ensures that the government Department, Ministers, Civil Servants and those delivering on their behalf act properly and are seen to be acting properly.</p>

<p>18. These basic conventions require that communications activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>should be relevant to the service you are providing</li>
  <li>should be factual, clear, objective and explanatory</li>
  <li>should not be, or be liable to misrepresentation as being, party political</li>
  <li>should be conducted in an economic and appropriate way, having regard to the need to be able to justify the costs as expenditure of public funds</li>
</ul>

<p>19. Your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact can provide you with help and guidance around content.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> information products and leaflets</h2>

<p>20. If you would like to order any <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> leaflets, a full list can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-leaflets-and-how-to-order-them"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> leaflets and how to order them</a>.</p>

<p>21. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-leaflets-and-how-to-order-them"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> leaflets and how to order them</a> provides guidance on how to order them.</p>

<h2>National media handling</h2>

<p>22. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has a national press office that is responsible for dealing with the national media (newspapers, news agencies, internet news, television, radio and specialist publications and magazines), providing media advice to Ministers and co-ordinating all visits with media involvement across the department.</p>

<p>23. You may be required to liaise with national press office on major announcements. However, you will have most day-to-day <abbr title="Public relations">PR</abbr> contact with the Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact.</p>

<p>24. You are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alert your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact to all negative stories and provide sufficient information for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to prepare and provide a statement to be used in response to media enquiries</li>
  <li>inform your Jobcentre Plus or <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contact of media activity being planned around <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision</li>
</ul>

<p>25. Ministers may want to be involved in publicity from time to time. You should in particular share plans around significant milestones (for example 100th person helped into work) and participant case studies and liaise with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> national press office.</p>

<p>26. Please visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://communicationcentre.dwp.gov.uk/" rel="external">Our Brands</a> to register with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Communication Centre and view the Communication Standards for Providers.</p>
