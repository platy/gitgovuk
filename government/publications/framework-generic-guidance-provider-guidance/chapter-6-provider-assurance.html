<h2>Introduction and background</h2>

<p>1. The Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) is part of Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Finance Group in the Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate (<abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate">CMPD</abbr>) and has been in operation since October 2009.</p>

<p>2. The primary purpose of the Provider Assurance Team is to provide the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate">CMPD</abbr> Director with an assurance that provider systems of internal control are such that payments made to <abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate">CMPD</abbr> providers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Treasury requirements.</p>

<p>3. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews and tests providers’ systems of internal control to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to health and employment provision expenditure and service delivery, including the arrangements they have in place for their supply chain.</p>

<p>4. This work is carried out by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> by reviewing providers’ internal control systems to assess their ability to manage risk across 3 key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Governance Arrangements – covering the provider’s governance arrangements, systems for tracking and reporting performance and their anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>Service Delivery – includes the provider’s systems for starting, ending and moving participants through provision and generally looks to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is getting the service it is paying for. This section also covers management of the supply chain</li>
  <li>Claim Procedures and Payments – looks to ensure that providers have in place effective systems to support their claims for payment, including appropriate segregation of duties</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we operate</h2>

<p>5. The Provider Assurance Team operates at a national level enabling it to present <abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate">CMPD</abbr> provision providers operating across regions with a single view of the effectiveness of their systems. Each provider is allocated a nominated Senior Provider Assurance Manager as a single point of contact within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for management of assurance related issues / concerns. Contact details for the team can be found at paragraph 37.</p>

<p>6. On completion of each review providers are awarded a <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> assurance rating in one of the following 4 categories:</p>

<p>(i) weak<br>
(ii) limited<br>
(iii) reasonable, or <br>
(iv) strong</p>

<p>7. The provider is sent a formal report which details the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement, and where weaknesses have been identified. Providers are required to complete an action plan setting out appropriate steps for improvement. Action plans are followed up until <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> is satisfied that all required actions have been undertaken.</p>

<p>8. The description of the 4 assurance levels are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide strong assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively, although improvements may be recommended</li>
  <li>Reasonable Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide reasonable assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively. Remedial action is required to improve the control environment</li>
  <li>Limited Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide limited assurance that material risks are identified and managed efficiently and effectively. Corrective action is required to resolve control weaknesses</li>
  <li>Weak Assurance – governance, risk management and control arrangements operated provide weak assurance that material risks are identified and managed effectively. Urgent and significant corrective action is required to resolve significant control weaknesses</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we plan</h2>

<p>9. In order to manage review activity and direct our resources in the most effective way, <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> operates a national plan covering all health and employment provision providers in scope for <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews. Provider reviews are allocated in priority order according to risk. This is determined by a number of factors including the current assurance rating, length of time since the previous review, and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholder intelligence.</p>

<h2>The review process</h2>

<p>10. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> look for evidence that systems are in place across provider organisations to manage key risks to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> expenditure. To facilitate this process the key risks have been broken down across the 3 scope areas (see paragraph 4) and <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will examine the controls in place within your organisation to look at how effective they are in managing the risks identified.</p>

<p>11. There are 5 stages to the review process which can take up to 23 weeks to complete, depending on the complexity of your organisation and the extent of your health or employment provision contracts. The bulk of provider facing activity takes place within field testing which generally lasts no longer than 5 weeks.</p>

<h3>Provider review process</h3>

<li>
<p>Go back to Step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Planning research and initial evaluation</h2>

<p>12. The purpose of this stage is to pull together all relevant information about you, form a paper-based opinion about your systems and develop the testing strategy to be used at your premises.</p>

<p>13. During this period you will be sent 2 documents:
* a Provider Systems Questionnaire (<abbr title="Provider Systems Questionnaire">PSQ</abbr>) which asks a series of questions about your systems across each of the 3 scope areas – see Annex 1 for the <abbr title="Provider Systems Questionnaire">PSQ</abbr>
* a site information stencil to confirm information about the delivery sites for the programmes</p>

<p>14. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> also take account of feedback from other departmental colleagues who work closely with you. Intelligence is gathered from these sources during the planning process and used alongside the <abbr title="Provider Systems Questionnaire">PSQ</abbr> response from you when forming an initial view of your risk and development of the test strategy. See paragraph 30 for the stakeholders consulted during this period.</p>

<h2>Field work at providers</h2>

<p>15. Commencement of the field work is signalled by a formal start-up meeting between yourselves and <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>. The purpose of this meeting is to brief you on the forthcoming review and agree the terms of engagement throughout including timescales for final feedback and the timeframe for providing all evidence by.</p>

<p>16. Based on the planning, research and initial evaluation, visits are arranged at your premises to carry out any testing deemed necessary to form a judgement as to the effectiveness of the systems under review.</p>

<p>17. The fieldwork can be conducted at any of your premises across the country and choosing which premises to visit will be determined by a number of factors, for example the provisions and activities delivered at individual sites, any intelligence gathered during the planning stage which may indicate weaknesses in certain areas, or the availability of <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> resource.</p>

<p>18. The tests will typically include reviewing key policy documents, examining participant files, interviewing staff, and performing checks in sufficient quantities to allow the team to form an opinion across your systems as a whole. This may mean that testing has to be extended in some circumstances or that it may be cut short in others.</p>

<p>19. During the testing period <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> provides a written summary of the key points found at that point in time. This allows the provider to understand and discuss the findings to date.</p>

<p>20. Throughout the testing period you will be given the opportunity to provide any supporting documentation and/or missing evidence that has been requested by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> but all evidence must be provided by the date agreed at the start up meeting.</p>

<h2>Final evaluation</h2>

<p>21. Evaluation of your systems is continuous throughout the end-to-end <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> process. Once testing is complete all the findings are considered and an overall assurance level is awarded covering the 3 scope areas of Governance Arrangements, Service Delivery and Claims Procedures and Payments based on the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of your systems across all aspects of the provision delivered under your health or employment provision contracts.</p>

<p>22. The final evaluation and assurance level will be formally presented to the provider at a final feedback meeting at a time agreed in advance. At this meeting <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will discuss what actions are going to be taken to address any issues raised and timescales for satisfactory completion of those actions.</p>

<h2>Review outputs</h2>

<p>23. Following the final feedback, a report is produced by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> and sent to you. The report will contain details of our findings and opinion against all key risk areas across the 3 scope areas and an overall assurance level assessment for the <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> report.</p>

<p>24. There will be an action plan at the back of the report covering all the issues raised at the feedback meeting. You are expected to return the action plan within 10 working days of receipt. Your response should contain any timescales for implementing any necessary improvements.</p>

<p>25. You are also asked to complete and return a feedback stencil to the Senior Assurance Manager. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is committed to providing an effective Provider Assurance function and in order to meet this commitment <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> need to constantly review the way in which they operate and their supporting policies and procedures. As a major stakeholder in this process, obtaining feedback from the provider is critical.</p>

<p>26. If there are any issues or causes for concern that cannot be addressed throughout the course of the review, then you should in the first instance put your complaint in writing to the Head of Provider Assurance Team. (contact details at paragraph 37).</p>

<p>27. There is no formal appeals process to allow you to challenge the level of assurance awarded. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> undertake a period of extensive evaluation to ensure that we have a good understanding of your systems and processes and we gain sufficient evidence through testing to reach a sound conclusion regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the controls within your organisation.</p>

<p>28. The final feedback meeting allows you ample opportunity to discuss the findings and assurance level, before the final report is issued.</p>

<p>29. If you are unhappy with the outcome there will be the opportunity to discuss your concerns with the Senior Assurance Manager (<abbr title="Senior Assurance Manager">SAM</abbr>) and/or Head of <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> but unless the findings are factually incorrect <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will not review the assurance rating once awarded.</p>

<p>30. The main focus of any meeting or correspondence after an assurance rating has been given will concentrate on the implementation of the areas for improvement as detailed in the action plan to strengthen your controls/maintain a strong level of control in preparation for your next review.</p>

<p>31. The report is also sent to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders, these typically include (but not exclusively):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance Managers</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Commercial Directorate</li>
  <li>Security Risk Advice Team</li>
  <li>Employment Accounts Division or Team PIP</li>
  <li>Counter Fraud and Investigation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Follow up of action plan</h2>

<p>32. Confirmation is sought by Performance Managers on behalf of <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> that all actions have been implemented. This follow up will take place within the timescales agreed with <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Other potential actions</h2>

<p>33. There may be other actions required depending on the findings of the review. These could involve the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overpayment recovery – if overpayments are identified and evidence could not be produced during the review then you will be asked to sign overpayment recovery stencils which will be given to the appropriate Payment Teams including <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> to make the necessary adjustments to the Payment Systems and reclaim the monies</li>
  <li>backtracking – if any overpayments or errors identified during the review indicate they are as a result of systematic weaknesses then you may be asked to ‘back track’. In such cases you will be required to provide the applicable evidence for the relevant contracts/provision over a specified period of time and in doing so identify for yourselves any overpayments. The results of the backtracking will be verified by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> before recovery action is taken</li>
</ul>

<p>34. For payments where an error rate has already been extrapolated backtracking and recovery action will not be applicable.</p>

<h2>Provider assurance team reporting</h2>

<p>35. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may periodically publish assurance levels by Provider (note - this will not include reports or supporting information).</p>

<p>36. All <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> provider assurance reports are shared with the <abbr title="Contracted Health and Employment Services Directorate">CMPD</abbr> Director and other senior managers within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>37. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may take remedial actions in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if following a Weak or Limited Assurance level from <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> your subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or you are awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if the provider fails to submit and/or implement the Action Plan within agreed timescale</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that a provider may be acting inappropriately the team will refer to Counter Fraud and Investigations as the experts trained in the legalities and techniques required to carry out formal investigations, or</li>
  <li>where there are serious concerns around data security these are reported through the respective channels to colleagues in the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security Risk Advice Team</li>
</ul>
