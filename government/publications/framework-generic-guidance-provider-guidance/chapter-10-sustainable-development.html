<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>10.1. Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) supports the government’s commitment to the delivery of the 17 United Nations (<abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>) Sustainable Development Goals (<abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr>) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The most effective way to do this is by ensuring that the Goals are fully embedded in planned activity of our department. Information on all 17 of the goals can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>10.2. The Goals recognise that ending poverty goes hand in hand with strategies to build economic growth and address a range of social needs including education, health, social protection, job opportunities and tackling climate change, while ensuring no one is left behind.</p>

<p>10.3. In April 2013, the government published its ‘Making sustainable development a part of all government policy and operations’ policy which stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The government is committed to sustainable development. This means making the necessary decisions now to realise our vision of stimulating economic growth and tackling the deficit, maximising wellbeing and protecting our environment, without affecting the ability of future generations to do the same. The government takes account of sustainable development as a part of how it develops its policies, how it runs its buildings and how it buys its goods and services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10.4. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> fully supports this, and aims to lead by example on this issue.</p>

<p>10.5. On 14 December 2016 the UK Government published the ‘Greening Government Commitments 2016 to 2020’ (<abbr title="Greening Government Commitments 2016 to 2020">GGC</abbr>) targets to replace the original Greening Government targets published on 1st April 2011. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, along with all other government departments are committed to deliver these targets as a minimum and we want all of our providers to be equally focussed to deliver a more sustainable business.</p>

<p>10.6. When delivering services outside the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estate, you (including your sub-contractors) should, where possible, make all reasonable endeavours to comply with the principles set out in the governments 2013 statement and the <abbr title="Greening Government Commitments 2016 to 2020">GGC</abbr> targets.</p>

<p>10.7. When delivering services on the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> estate (Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) premises) you (including your sub-contractors) will work with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to assist in making progress towards the <abbr title="Greening Government Commitments 2016 to 2020">GGC</abbr> targets and the wider sustainable development principles (for example, by adhering to any local policies relating to the environment/sustainable development).</p>

<p>10.8. You will be required to complete a policy statement (6 months after the contract start date) to demonstrate how you will satisfy and adhere to the principles of sustainable development.</p>

<p>10.9. As part of this policy statement, you will need to give an assurance that your waste is disposed of by a registered waste collector, in accordance with current regulations, and that items such as ink cartridges and toners are recycled or disposed of in the correct way. Assurance must also be provided that Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (<abbr title="Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment">WEEE</abbr>) regulations are observed with regard to the disposal of electrical and electronic equipment.</p>

<p>10.10. You must produce a plan relating to sustainable development (6 months after the contract start date) to explain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how waste produced will be minimised and the promotion of recycling within your business</li>
  <li>how energy consumption will be minimised</li>
  <li>how the use of transport will be minimised and how you will promote the use of public transport</li>
  <li>how staff awareness of sustainability will be increased</li>
  <li>provide:
    <ul>
      <li>details of a baseline assessment of your current position in terms of waste minimisation, recycling levels and energy consumption (energy consumption will only be required if current energy usage is available)</li>
      <li>annual estimates of the progress made in your plan</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>10.11. The above should form part of the plan relating to sustainable development.</p>

<p>10.12. The policy statement and plan must be provided when requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (this will be 6 months after the contract start date). Both the policy statement and plan must be contract specific and also reflect all sub-contractors involved in delivery of the contract.</p>

<p>10.13. Sustainability must be integrated into services so that they are delivered through a sustainable, innovative and productive economy that delivers high levels of employment and a just society that promotes social inclusion, sustainable communities and personal well-being. This will be done in ways that protect and enhance the physical and natural environment and uses resources and energy as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>10.14. Provision will improve the employability of participants and deliver environmental or community benefits by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using innovative methods (including those that reduce travel requirements) to deliver services</li>
  <li>supporting skills and jobs that will work towards improving conservation</li>
  <li>identifying skills needed in work areas that will have a positive effect on the environment</li>
  <li>reducing skills gaps locally</li>
  <li>providing placements delivered through local and charitable organisations</li>
</ul>
