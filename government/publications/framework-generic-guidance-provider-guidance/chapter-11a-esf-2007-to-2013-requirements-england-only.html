<h2>Requirements:</h2>

<p>Adhere to European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) contractual requirements including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Retention</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Audit Requirements</li>
  <li>Marketing and Publicity</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Cross Cutting Themes</li>
  <li>Evaluation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. This chapter provides information about mandatory requirements that apply to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and match funded provision in England. This includes the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Support for Families with Multiple Problems provision, the Work Programme, Work Choice and Day One Support for Young People provision in England. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the withdrawal of funding.</p>

<p>2. Guidance for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and match funded provision that went live prior to 2011 is provided in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-provider-guidance">2007 to 2010 European Social Fund chapter</a>.</p>

<p>3. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements outlined in this chapter apply to you and your whole supply chain throughout delivery. It is your responsibility to adhere to these requirements and to ensure your supply chain does the same. You are ultimately accountable for the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> compliance of your contract, including your sub contracts. Failure to comply with any of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can result in the repayment of funds.</p>

<p>4. Your Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Performance Manager (<abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr>) is responsible for the implementation and delivery of these contractual requirements. The <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will ensure that performance and compliance with the regulatory requirements is managed in a formal structured setting.</p>

<p>5. The <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> will be assisted by a Compliance Monitoring Officer (<abbr title="Compliance Monitoring Officer">CMO</abbr>). The <abbr title="Compliance Monitoring Officer">CMO</abbr> will be responsible for a programme of contract compliance monitoring to ensure that contracts meet specific European Union regulatory requirements.</p>

<h2>Document retention</h2>

<p>6. There are specific rules that apply to the retention of documents; these are detailed at paragraph 12. Documents must be retained until at least 31 December 2022; you will be updated should this date be changed at any stage in the future. The list of documents that must be retained detailed at paragraph 15 may not be completely exhaustive and could be subject to further review in the future.</p>

<p>7. Where an organisation within your supply chain ceases to trade or is no longer doing business with you, it is your responsibility to recover all relevant and original documents held by the sub-contractor. Those documents are, as specified in the table at paragraph 15 and must be retained for the full retention period i.e. until at least 31 December 2022 (in England).</p>

<p>8. Where you cease to trade or will no longer be doing business with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> you should discuss retention of documents with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Account Manager.</p>

<h2>Electronic document retention</h2>

<p>9. European Commission regulations allow for documents to be retained as either the original paper copies or as an electronic copy of the originals. The regulations allow for the electronic storage of documents provided that they are stored on a recognised data carrier (for example, compact disc read-only memory (<abbr title="compact disc read-only memory">CD ROM</abbr>), Hard Disk or Magnetic Disk), are certified as being copies of the original, meet national standards and are auditable. Documents must be held on an accepted data carrier. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>microfiches of original documents</li>
  <li>electronic versions of original documents on data carriers</li>
</ul>

<p>10. For each data carrier used, you must retain a signed declaration that the documents held within the data carrier are certified as being true copies (conforming to) the originals. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Declaration on headed paper satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p>11. Minimum requirements associated with completion of the declaration are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all declarations must be made available on request</li>
  <li>documents can be certified as true copies of the original document either individually or as a group of documents; however a declaration will be required each time documents(s) are copied and retained for audit purposes</li>
  <li>the declaration can be kept as an electronic or paper copy. The declaration can be included on the electronic copy of the documents and stored electronically. If the document(s) are certified using a paper copy it is extremely important that it is stored with the appropriate stored data carrier</li>
  <li>electronic copies of original documents must be kept for the same length of time as paper copies. For further information on Document Retention see paragraph 6</li>
  <li>the signature can be original or an electronic signature</li>
  <li>the electronic copies must be reliable for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> audit purposes through to 31st December 2022. For example, they must be:
    <ul>
      <li>stored in such a way that they are safe and cannot be modified</li>
      <li>can be effectively retrieved</li>
      <li>accessible in a readable format</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: DWP and The National Archives recommend that electronically held data is migrated onto new formats every 5 years to ensure the data remains readable and usable.</p>
</div>

<h2>Retained documentation</h2>

<p>12. You must ensure that you have robust systems and controls in place to maintain and monitor access to documentation throughout the retention period.</p>

<p>13. All documents (including any electronic information) must be readily accessible to requests from auditors and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> upon request and stored in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> standards. To support audit activity, it is recommended that a separate file of documentation for each individual participant is linked to a specific Contract Package Area number; and arranged in a filing system that will enable the effective retrieval of documentation.</p>

<p>14. Audits will scrutinise down to the level of an individual participant. Documentation must show that payments claimed in respect of an individual participant were eligible in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. The participant file, either in hard copy or electronic format, must also contain evidence that the participant was made aware that the provision is part funded by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<p>15. The table below lists the documentation that must be retained as a minimum to meet audit requirements until at least 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>16. You should have submitted a document retention policy and plan to your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Performance Manager">PM</abbr> within 4 weeks of the contract starting. This will be monitored and reviewed by your Performance Manager.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Audit requirements</h2>

<p>17. You and your sub-contractors are subject to audit controls and review. The following is a list of the bodies, which require access for audit purposes – it is not exhaustive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Audit Authority</li>
  <li>the European Court of Auditors</li>
  <li>the European Commission’s Auditors</li>
  <li>the National Audit Office</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Risk Assurance Division</li>
  <li>other bodies as required by or on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/European Commission</li>
</ul>

<p>18. It cannot be emphasised enough that failure to meet audit requirements results in a high financial risk for both providers and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, as funds used inappropriately or for ineligible participants or purposes are recoverable.</p>

<h2>Marketing and publicity</h2>

<p>19. There are a number of contractual requirements for all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funded and match-funded provision, which apply to you and your sub-contractors in terms of marketing and publicity. Failure to meet these requirements could result in significant financial penalties.</p>

<p>20. You are required to develop and implement a Marketing and Publicity Plan which will detail the activities you will undertake to satisfy the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> regulatory requirements (see Chapter 9 of this guidance). The plan will be monitored and reviewed by the Performance Manager on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Contractual requirements for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> marketing and publicity</h2>

<p>21. To meet these requirements, you and your sub-contractors must have specific <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> publicity measures in place which include, but are not restricted to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with ‘Good News’ stories/Case Studies on a regular basis</li>
  <li>displaying an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2007 to 2013 plaque</li>
  <li>reminding participants of European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>) and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> support throughout their time on provision</li>
  <li>supplying provider and provision details for inclusion in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/esf/esf-in-action/esf-projects/" rel="external"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> public databases</a>
</li>
  <li>using the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo in line with guidance, on websites</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> publicity materials produced by providers must be approved by Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) before publishing and use</li>
  <li>displaying the Cornwall Convergence and Mayor of London logo where relevant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Providing good news stories/case studies</h2>

<p>22. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/Jobcentre Plus regularly requires information on participants whose individual stories can be celebrated.

<p>25. The National Marketing and Publicity Manager may use your good news/case study in such things as ministerial speeches, newsletters, magazines, newspapers or television etc. The relevance of the story will be checked with you prior to publishing.</p>

<p>26. Reference to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> funding must also be used within the body of the text of your good news story for all <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> funded and match-funded provision.

Attached at Annex 2 is a Best Practice Stencil for you to complete and share with your Performance Manager and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Manager.</p>

<h2>Marketing and Public Relations (<abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr>) planning</h2>

<p>39.

This is to achieve complementary timing of activity and consistency of message.</p>

<p>40. There will be times when elements of the marketing plans will need changing. For example, you may need to be flexible on timing, if there is a clash, which might lead to confusion for the target audience. Additionally you might need to incorporate ministerial involvement in <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr> activity.</p>

<p>41. Further information relating to marketing and publicity can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-provider-guidance">Generic Guidance Chapter 9 Marketing and Participant Communications</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>evaluation by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Managing Authority (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>regional evaluation commissioned by or on behalf of the Regional Skills Partnership</li>

<p>46. It is likely that you may be asked to participate, and to assist in identifying participants for the cohort and other surveys. This may involve providing contact details for some or all participants, having sought in advance the permission of the individuals concerned.</p>

<p>47. Researchers may wish to visit and interview you, programme participants and partners involved in the provision. Providers delivering this provision will be contacted beforehand. Findings will be disseminated to all providers in order to facilitate sharing and adoption of best practice and continuous improvement of the service. Evaluation findings will also be published as part of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> research series.</p>

<p>48. You will also be asked to report on progress and evaluate your own provision at regular intervals to support DWPs reporting requirement to the Managing Authority at regional and national levels.
