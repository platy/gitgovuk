<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1. The self assessment section details the requirements and approach that you should undertake to form judgements on the quality of service that you deliver on all Welfare to Work provision.</p>

<h2>High level must dos</h2>

<ul>
  <li>you are required as part of your contract to undertake a self assessment process</li>
  <li>your Self Assessment must consider all 11 statements outlined in the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) provider Self Assessment Tool</li>
  <li>an initial Self Assessment will be completed six months after contract start and thereafter annually</li>
  <li>areas for improvement identified from your Self Assessment should be included within an improvement plan</li>
  <li>you must make both your Self Assessment and improvement plans available to the Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) during their reviews of your provision</li>
</ul>

<h2>Completing the self assessment</h2>

<p>2. Continuous Self Assessment is fundamental to driving forward quality improvement. As a condition of your contract you are required by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to carry out Self Assessment of all provisions that you are delivering to form a judgement on the quality of the service delivered and how this can be further improved.</p>

<p>3. The <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provider Self Assessment Tool (<abbr title="Self Assessment Tool">SAT</abbr>) defines a series of 11 statements that must be covered as part of the self-assessment. The <abbr title="Self Assessment Tool">SAT</abbr> will provide a measure of the quality of all provision that is delivered to the participant, the participants experience and statutory requirements. The <abbr title="Self Assessment Tool">SAT</abbr> aide memoir at Annex 1 outlines these statements and provides example evidence sources and related standards.</p>

<p>4. You should be objective and honest in the evaluation of your organisation as a whole. Judgements should be based on clear solid evidence and your Self Assessment should include strengths, areas for improvement and satisfactory areas that can be improved.</p>

<p>5. It is important to remember that Self Assessment and improvement planning is not a one-off activity but should be part of continuous improvement, integrated into regular planning and quality improvement activities.</p>

<h2>Format of the self assessment</h2>

<p>6. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is not specifying a format for your self-assessment but you must consider all 11 statements contained in Annex 1 as part of the process.</p>

<h2>Evidence to support Self Assessment</h2>

<p>7. Throughout the year you should be regularly collecting evidence, such as participant feedback and performance data and evaluating this information as part of your quality improvement arrangements. It is important that systems and processes in place are effective, easy to use and comprehensive. The evidence gathered should then be used to support the grades and judgements you award your provision/s in your Self Assessment.</p>

<p>8. Examples of the type of evidence you could include in your Self Assessment are included in Annex 1.</p>

<h2>Making judgements</h2>

<p>9. Once the evidence has been gathered, you should make judgements about your provision/s by considering all aspects of your participants’ experience.</p>

<p>10. It is important to ensure standards are consistent throughout your organisation. It is vital you have systems in place to assess consistency across the entire provision/s, including that delivered by sub-contractors.
Grading the Self Assessment</p>

<p>11. Although the Self Assessment should provide an assessment of the quality of provision/s <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has not defined a particular grading system that should be used. It is for you to decide what grading system best suits your organisation, for example whether a numerical scale or <abbr title="Red, Amber, Green">RAG</abbr> (Red, Amber, Green) rating is used. Regardless of the grading system used the grades should reflect the balance of key strengths and areas for improvement identified. The number of strengths and areas for improvement is not as important as their significance. You should consider the impact of the strengths or areas for improvement on the participant and your performance.</p>

<p>12. It is important you are honest when assessing and grading your provision/s. An accurate reflection of all provision in your self assessment indicates how well you know your business.</p>

<h2>Planning for Improvement</h2>

<p>13. As a result of the annual Self Assessment, providers will consider what actions will be taken to rectify any weaknesses identified and plans for improving the overall quality of all provision. This will ensure progress towards an overall goal of consistently high quality and responsive delivery to participants. The areas identified for improvement should be included within an improvement plan. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has not specified a set format for quality improvement plans and you can therefore decide whether you have a separate quality improvement plan or capture areas identified from the self assessment within existing plans you hold in your organisation.</p>

<p>14. You should prioritise actions by considering what will bring about the most significant improvements, how changes will affect your participants and how long it will take to implement.</p>

<p>15. Actions on your quality improvement plan should also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>clear, specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, time bound objectives and targets for improvement</li>
  <li>who is responsible for ensuring the actions are carried out</li>
  <li>timescales for completion, with milestones where appropriate</li>
  <li>arrangements for monitoring and reporting on progress</li>
  <li>dates when actions are completed and the outcomes achieved</li>
</ul>

<h2>The role of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in the Self Assessment process</h2>

<p>16. The Self Assessment is for you to use in judging quality of all provision and areas for improvement and there is no requirement to submit this to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> once completed. Performance Management Division will not use the Self Assessment as part of the regular performance management process and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will not use the Self Assessment to benchmark providers in any way.</p>

<p>17. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will seek assurance from you that you have undertaken self-assessment, identified improvement actions within plans and these actions are in progress. The Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) will have responsibility for undertaking this assurance role during their provider reviews. The <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will ask to see both the Self Assessment and improvement plans during the course of their reviews.</p>

<h2>Consequences of failing to undertake must dos</h2>

<p>18. Where you do not meet the must dos in undertaking your Self Assessment this will be reflected in the findings of your <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> assurance report.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Aid memoir to provide some key pointers to consider against each of the 11 quality self-assessment statements</h2>

<p>This aid memoir is designed to provide you with some key pointers of what you should be considering against each of the 11 quality self assessment statements. Evidence to support your self assessment should as far as possible be based upon existing information sources, rather than requiring additional evidence gathering. Examples of some potential evidence sources, including related standards that may be applicable are also shown against each statement. This aide memoir should not be seen as a definitive list but illustrative only.</p>

<h2>Annex 2: Effective Self-Assessment</h2>

<h3>Effective Self Assessment</h3>

<p>1. Effective Self Assessment is a comprehensive process through which you evaluate all of your provision/s, including any elements delivered by sub-contractors. It is an integral activity as you gather evidence throughout the year and monitor how well you are meeting agreed targets and reconsider strategies for achieving your goals.</p>

<p>2. Self Assessment is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a continuous process to improve the quality of all provision</li>
  <li>is representative of everything that you deliver, looking across the range of provision delivered</li>
  <li>an assessment of strengths and areas for improvement</li>
  <li>the focus to identify and implement quality improvements</li>
  <li>an essential aspect of quality improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>3. A self-critical and objective process of Self Assessment will enable you to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strengths to build upon</li>
  <li>satisfactory areas that can be improved</li>
  <li>areas for improvement that require immediate action</li>
  <li>as a general guide:
    <ul>
      <li>include an overview of areas that have improved and areas still requiring improvement</li>
      <li>provide either cross references/signposting to where appropriate evidence and data can be found or give sufficient evidence including relevant data, to support judgements</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Evidence to support Self Assessment</h3>

<p>4. It is important to include brief references to information/evidence to support the strengths and areas for improvement you have identified. This could include feedback from participants, employers and other 3rd parties, including sub-contractors. Methods used to gather this information could include questionnaires, focus groups/workshops and an effective complaints procedure. You should obtain regular feedback to identify the needs and satisfaction levels of your participants, including those who are leaving/have left all provision.</p>

<p>5. Your annual Self Assessment review should bring together a summary of your findings. The narrative should include evaluative judgements to support the strengths or areas for improvement identified, stating the evidence on which this is based and sign-posting to detailed records held within your organisation.</p>

<p>6. Your Self Assessment should include brief but effective use of analysed data and management information. It should contain sufficient statistics to support judgements regarding participants’ achievements, performance and overall strengths and areas for improvement for your provision/s.</p>

<p>7. Evidence gathered should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reliable, include a range of different types and gathered from various sources</li>
  <li>valid and adequately support the judgements made</li>
  <li>accurate and from verifiable sources</li>
  <li>current, providing an up to date picture of your provision/s</li>
  <li>sufficient to reflect the full range of provision/s</li>
  <li>quantifiable, if using the data to evaluate, for example retention and achievement</li>
</ul>

<p>8. When making sound judgements you should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strengths identified should not just be examples of ‘normal’ practice but be over and above what is expected as a standard level of service. For example, ‘regular participant reviews’ would not be a key strength as regular monitoring of progress is expected from all providers. Consistently effective reviews that are meaningful, tailored to individuals needs and have a positive impact on their progress, could be a consideration for a key strength;</li>
  <li>judgements should be evaluative not descriptive. Descriptions of policies/procedures are not judgements and say nothing about how effective they are or about the quality of the provision/s</li>
  <li>strengths and areas for improvement should be ‘key’ strengths and ‘key’ areas for improvement. They must have a significant impact on your participants’ experience</li>
</ul>

<h3>Planning for Improvement</h3>
<p>9. The actions included in the quality improvement plan should aim to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bring about improvements for weak aspects identified</li>
  <li>improve areas identified as satisfactory</li>
  <li>build on strengths</li>
</ul>
