<p>Data showing the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in wastewater by the Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection (<abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr>) wastewater monitoring programme.</p>

<h2>Background on <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater monitoring programme</h2>

<p>People infected with COVID-19 shed the virus during daily activities such as going to the toilet and blowing noses. The virus enters the sewer system through sinks, drains and toilets. Fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes COVID-19) can be detected in samples of wastewater (untreated sewage).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> programme, led by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (part of NHS Test and Trace and soon to be part of UKHSA), tests sewage for fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Untreated influent samples are taken from approximately 270 sewage treatment works (<abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>) in England, 4 times a week (see figures 1 to 9 below). <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> also sample from sewer network sites (manholes). Data from these sites are not included in this publication as sewer network sites fall within <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> catchments. Further detail about <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater coverage can be found in the publication <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-19-may-2021-emhp-programme/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-the-environmental-monitoring-for-health-protection-emhp-programme" class="govuk-link">Wastewater testing coverage data for the Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection (<abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr>) programme</a>.</p>

<p>The programme helps identify where the virus is circulating in England, detecting spikes in prevalence and presence of variants. Findings are reported to national decision makers and local stakeholders on a regular basis, helping to inform national strategy and localised action. Wastewater analysis has the benefit of detecting the virus regardless of whether people have symptoms or whether they have a test. Wastewater monitoring complements other testing programmes and public health actions to help protect against the threat of new variants.</p>

<p>As the threat of variants has emerged, the programme plays an important role in the detection of mutations of the virus, variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>) and variants under investigation (<abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr>). This is achieved through genomic sequencing of wastewater samples, to provide an indication of where <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and <abbr title="variants under investigation">VUIs</abbr> may be present across England. Insights from wastewater monitoring are shared with local and national decision makers, to help inform the action that they can take to stop further transmission.</p>

<p>The programme is led by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) and run in partnership with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Environment Agency (EA), the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, academia (Cefas) and water companies. It provides coverage of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-19-may-2021-emhp-programme/wastewater-testing-coverage-data-for-the-environmental-monitoring-for-health-protection-emhp-programme">approximately 40 million people across England</a>. The <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> team coordinates with programmes in the devolved administrations to provide UK-wide wastewater monitoring.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> sampling sites</h2>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> sample at sewer network sites (manholes in the street which generally serve a local area) and sewage treatment works (<abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>) (which generally serve wider areas such as a city or town). Associated with every <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> and sewer network site is a catchment; the geographical area from which wastewater flows into the sampling location. This publication reports data from <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>. Data from sewer networks are not included because sewer network sites almost always fall within the catchment of a <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr>. In addition, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> change sampling strategy and locations of sewer network sites to meet epidemiological priorities (for example to support local public health response). Figures 1 to 9 show the location of <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> that <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> sample at in each region.</p>

<h2>Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples</h2>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> wastewater concentration data from 1 June 2021 to 23 August 2021 is available in the accompanying spreadsheet. The spreadsheet includes data from previous monthsâ publications, along with the latest August data. The most recent 4  weeks of data  is visualised in figures 10 and 11; England concentration map. Note that <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> are omitted from figures 10 and 11 if no samples were taken during the week.</p>

<p>In the first week of August, 155 of 262 <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> (59%) showed a decrease in weekly average concentration compared to the previous week. In the second week of August, 161 of 260 <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> (62%) had a decrease in the average concentration relative to previous week. In the third week of August, there was generally an increase in concentration, with 142 of 260 <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> (55%) showing higher weekly average compared to the previous week. In the fourth week of August, 163 of 263 <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> (62%) showed an increase in average concentration compared to the previous week. Furthermore, any interpretation should be made with careful consideration of the points in the âUncertainty, data quality and revisionsâ section below.</p>

<h4>Figures 10 and 11: England concentration map â map showing the location of SWTs sampled</h4>

<p>Colour indicates the weekly-average SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (gene copies per litre) in the last 4 weeks. See regional maps for the names of each SWT.</p>

<h3>Regional average concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater</h3>

<p>The concentration of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in wastewater increased in every region from late June to late August. This is indicative of increasing prevalence. However, there is high variability in concentration between individual <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>. Interpretation should be made with careful consideration of the points in the âUncertainty, data quality and revisionsâ section below.</p>

<p>Figures 12 to 20 show the 7-day rolling average SARS-CoV-2 concentrations detected in wastewater for each region in England, together with the national average of SARS-CoV-2 Concentrations detected in wastewater and individual site data over the 12-week period. Samples where no SARS-CoV-2 was detected are assigned the value 160 (gc/l) which is the theoretical limit of detection. Data is weighted by catchment population to account for varying catchment sizes. For further information, see âMethodologyâ section below.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h3>About this data</h3>

<p><abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> sample wastewater from <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> throughout England. Samples are analysed for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the number of copies of the nucleocapsid gene (<abbr title="nucleocapsid">N1</abbr>). Samples are transported to Environment Agency laboratory for quantification of the <abbr title="nucleocapsid">N1</abbr> gene using a process called reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The data reported here are the number of SARS-CoV-2 <abbr title="nucleocapsid">N1</abbr> gene copies per litre of wastewater (shortened to gene copies per litre throughout this document). Generally, the more people with COVID-19 in the community the more viral RNA will be shed into wastewater. Therefore, the concentration in wastewater is indicative of the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community.</p>

<p>Samples are analysed for the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and concentration is adjusted for flow (see the âUncertainty, data quality and revisionsâ section below). Typically, 4 samples per week are analysed from each <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr>. However, occasionally fewer samples will be collected and/or analysed. This can be due to several reasons such as <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> altering sampling strategy because of testing capacity constraints, changing epidemiological priorities and current local response activities.</p>

<p>Weekly concentration table and daily concentration table show the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples (gene copies per litre). Note that there is sensitivity associated with the analysis of wastewater; the limit of detection (<abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr>) is the minimum concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be reliably detected. Data tables contain the values â<abbr title="âtheoretical limit of detection">tLOD</abbr>â where analysis of the sample did not detect presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. For the purposes of averaging data to produce weekly averages in the weekly concentration table and figures 10 and 11, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> assign a concentration of 160 gene copies per litre to all â<abbr title="âtheoretical limit of detection">tLOD</abbr>â samples. This concentration is the theoretical limit of detection and is calculated by the Environment Agency. Note that there is uncertainty in this calculation and continuing work to refine it, please see the âUncertainty, data quality and revisionsâ section below for further information.</p>

<p>To calculate region averages, data from each <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> was weighted by catchment population. To estimate the population of <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>, the catchment areas of <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> are matched to lower layer super output areas (LSOAs). Catchment areas were provided by the nine water companies serving England. See the <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> publication wastewater testing coverage data for the <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> programme for a detailed description of this method. Regional and national averages were calculated by taking the 7-day rolling arithmetic mean. Figures are displayed on a logarithmic scale for ease of interpretation.</p>

<p>We are exploring the feasibility of adding more data in future releases, such as detection of variants.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Wastewater samples are collected by water companies and transported to an Environment Agency Laboratory. Concentration data are from Environment Agency analysis of wastewater samples.</p>

<p>Figures in this publication show the location of <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>. These locations were obtained from the <a rel="external" href="https://uwwtd.eu/United-Kingdom/treatment-plant/ukenthtwutp000014/2016" class="govuk-link">European Commission urban wastewater website</a>. Note that names differ between those used in this document and the European Commission urban wastewater website, sites can be linked using the â<abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> site codeâ in the attached data tables.</p>

<p>The figures and analysis presented will evolve over time to ensure the most relevant information is included and the needs of stakeholders are met. These figures will initially be published monthly, from June 2021, and we will continuously evaluate the frequency and date-range based on need and public interest.</p>

<h3>How these figures can be used</h3>

<p>These figures and data can be used to view the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, which is indicative of prevalence in the community. Due to factors relating to data uncertainty, <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> recommend interpretation of this data with other data sources such Weekly Statistics for NHS Test and Trace (England).</p>

<h3>Uncertainty, data quality and revisions</h3>

<p>The figures here are compiled by professional analysts and have been quality assured. However, the analytical pipeline to produce this data should still be considered experimental; it is subject to an ongoing quality assurance process. Any revisions to past publications will be in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standards-for-official-statistics-published-by-dhsc/statement-on-revision-policy">DHSCâs revision policy</a> and highlighted in future publications accordingly. The sites from which <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> sample can change on a regular basis depending on testing capacity, epidemiological priorities and current local response activities. This can result in changes to specific <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> covered. This means the <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> included in subsequent publications may change.</p>

<p>This publication shows <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr> as single points. Every <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> has an associated geographical catchment area (area from which wastewater flows into the sampling location). These catchments are not yet presented in these statistics publications. There is uncertainty surrounding catchment geography, as catchments vary in size and population covered, and in some cases an <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> may not be located within the catchment it serves (for example, if wastewater is pumped to the <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr>). Therefore, the location of <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> should be used as a general guide only.</p>

<p>Wastewater is an inherently variable material and can change greatly within and between days (foodstuffs being consumed; when washing machines are switched on and many other factors), the physical infrastructure and the type and levels of industrial wastes. It is generally more useful to consider trends over medium- and long-term periods of time, rather than between individual days.</p>

<p>There are several factors that can impact the quality of the signal recorded from wastewater and introduce uncertainty.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may be impacted by weather, for example heavy rainfall wastewater may cause dilution. <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> mitigate this by adjusting concentration to consider flow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether samples are âcompositeâ or âgrabâ. Composite samples are where an autosampler (a machine which gathers wastewater at regular intervals over a set time period) gathers wastewater throughout the day. Grab samples are where a single sample is taken at one point in the day and are subject to greater variability; they are influenced by flow characteristics, time of day, and are more susceptible to outliers in the sewage. <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> aim to mitigate this by sampling during times of peak load and ensuring the sample is collected mid-stream rather than close to the edges or bottom of the pipe</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Calculating the limit of detection (<abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr>), the minimum concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be reliably detected in a wastewater sample) can be achieved by several methods. In this data we have used the theoretical <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> as calculated by the Environment Agency. The theoretical <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> uses several assumptions. Laboratory data is required to inform the more realistic practical <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr>. The practical <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> for this analysis is not yet reported here. It is likely that the <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> used in producing these statistics will change in future publications. <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> will clearly state when this occurs.</p>

<p>Although the exact value of the <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> is uncertain, it is unlikely to have a noticeable impact on the interpretation of this data. This is because the difference between theoretical and practical <abbr title="limit of detection">LOD</abbr> is relatively small, with most impact at low levels of the target being measured.</p>

<p>As explained in the âAbout this dataâ section above, typically 4 wastewater samples are taken at each <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> per week. The average of all samples within the week is presented in the weekly concentration table. Uncertainty occurs where fewer samples are taken. For example, if only one sample is taken during a week, that one sample defines the week average. This means weeks with fewer samples are more susceptible to variability and outliers. The sample count table shows how many samples were taken at an <abbr title="sewage treatment work">STW</abbr> for each week in this release.</p>

<h4>For the above reasons <abbr title="Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection">EMHP</abbr> advise caution when directly comparing data between <abbr title="sewage treatment works">STWs</abbr>.</h4>
