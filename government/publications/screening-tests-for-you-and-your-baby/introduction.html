<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Screening tests</h2>

<p>Screening tests are used to find people at higher chance of a health condition. This means they can get earlier, potentially more effective treatment, or make informed decisions about their health. It can be helpful to imagine screening like putting people through a sieve. Most people pass straight through but a small number get caught in the sieve. The people caught in the sieve are those considered to have a higher chance of having the health condition being screened for.</p>

<p>Screening tests are not perfect. Some people will be told that they or their baby have a high chance of having a health condition when in fact they do not have the condition (false positive). Also, a few people will be told that they or their baby have a low chance of having a health condition when in fact they do have the condition (false negative).</p>

<p>Partners are welcome to attend screening and information sessions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The difference between screening tests and diagnostic tests</h2>

<p>A screening test can find out if you, or your baby, have a high or low chance of having a health condition. But it cannot usually tell you for certain, so people found to have a high chance of a condition will often be offered another kind of test. This is called a diagnostic test and gives a more definite ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Screening tests during and after pregnancy</h2>

<p>Screening tests are offered during pregnancy to try to find any health conditions that you or your baby may have. The tests – ultrasound scans, blood tests and a questionnaire – can help you make choices about care or treatment during pregnancy or after your baby is born.</p>

<p>Newborn screening tests are offered for your baby soon after he or she is born. We offer these so your baby can be given appropriate treatment as quickly as possible if needed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Some practicalities</h2>

<p>If you know that you, the father of your baby, or a family member already has a health condition, please tell your midwife. If you move home while waiting for the results of any screening test, please tell your midwife or health visitor your new address.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Screening is your choice</h2>

<p>Whether or not to have each test is a personal choice and one which only you can make. You can discuss each test you are offered with health professionals and decide, based on your own circumstances, whether or not it is right for you. You can also change your mind at any stage.</p>

<p>Some of the screening tests described here, such as blood tests for infectious diseases, eye screening if you have diabetes and the newborn checks, are recommended by the NHS. This is because results from these tests can help make sure that you or your baby gets urgent treatment for serious conditions.</p>

<p>Screening tests in pregnancy for sickle cell disease and thalassaemia, Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome, Patau’s syndrome and the 20-week scan can lead to very personal decisions. These could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether or not to have a diagnostic test with a possible chance of miscarriage</li>
  <li>whether to continue or end your pregnancy</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to think carefully about whether or not you want to have these screening tests. Your decisions will be respected and health care professionals will support you. You should speak up if you feel your decisions are not being respected.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Further support</h2>

<p>For details of organisations that can provide support about any of the conditions in this information, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Screening and the NHS</h2>

<p>The NHS decides which screening tests to offer based on good evidence. A group of experts called the UK National Screening Committee (<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>) provides advice to the NHS. All screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Some private companies also provide screening tests that you have to pay for. The NHS cannot guarantee the quality of private screening. Get more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/phe/private-screening">advice about private screening</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Confidentiality</h2>

<p>The NHS Screening Programmes use personal information from your NHS records to invite you for screening at the right time. NHS England also uses your information to ensure you receive high quality care and to improve the screening programmes. Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/patient-confidentiality-in-nhs-population-screening-programmes">how your information is used and protected, and your options</a>.</p>

<p>If screening or pre-natal diagnostic (<abbr title="pre-natal diagnosis">PND</abbr>) tests suggest your baby has certain conditions we will pass the information to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (<abbr title="National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service">NCARDRS</abbr>). This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sickle cell disease or thalassaemia</li>
  <li>Down’s syndrome, Edwards’ syndrome or Patau’s syndrome</li>
  <li>other conditions picked up by the 20-week scan</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a secure national register of children who are born with rare conditions. It helps us improve screening and prevent or treat the condition. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/phe/ncardrs">Opt out of the register or find out more.</a> We will never publish information that could identify you or your child.</p>
