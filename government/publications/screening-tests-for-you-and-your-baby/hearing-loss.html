<p>This short video explains screening for hearing loss in newborn babies.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Screening for hearing loss is recommended by the NHS.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose of screening</h2>

<p>To find babies who have a hearing loss so that support and advice can be offered right from the start.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>About this condition</h2>

<p>One to 2 babies in every 1,000 are born with a permanent hearing loss in one or both ears. Most of these babies are born into families with no history of hearing loss.</p>

<p>Permanent hearing loss can significantly affect a baby’s development. Finding out about hearing loss early gives babies a better chance of developing language, speech and communication skills, as well as making sure their families receive the support they need. It will help babies make the most of relationships with their family and carers from an early age.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>The screening test</h2>

<p>The hearing screening test will be offered to your baby in hospital before discharge, when you are at home, or you will be invited to attend a clinic appointment. Ideally, the screening test should be done in the first 4 to 5 weeks, but it can be done at up to 3 months of age.</p>

<p>The screening test called the AOAE (automated otoacoustic emission) takes a few minutes. A small soft tipped earpiece is placed in your baby’s ear and soft clicking sounds are played. When an ear receives sound, the inner part (called the cochlea) responds and this can be picked up by the screening equipment.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to get clear responses from the first screening test. This does not necessarily mean your baby has a hearing loss. It can mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your baby was unsettled when the test was done</li>
  <li>there was background noise</li>
  <li>your baby has fluid or a temporary blockage in their ear – this is very common and passes with time</li>
  <li>your baby has a hearing loss</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases your baby will be offered another screening test. This may be the same as the first screening test, or another type called the AABR (automated auditory brainstem response) test.</p>

<p>This involves 3 small sensors being placed on your baby’s forehead, back of the neck and shoulder. Soft headphones are placed over your baby’s ears and soft clicking sounds are played. The screening equipment will be able to tell if your baby’s hearing nerve responds to the sounds. This will help us determine whether your baby has hearing loss or not.</p>

<p>This screening test may take up to 15 minutes. Your baby needs to be settled or asleep.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Safety of the test</h2>

<p>There are no risks associated with having this screening test.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Screening is your choice</h2>

<p>This screening test is recommended for your baby. Finding hearing loss early is important for your baby’s development.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Not having the test</h2>

<p>If you decide not to have the newborn hearing screening test you will be given checklists to help you check on your baby’s hearing as they grow older. If you have any concerns you should speak to your health visitor or <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Possible results</h2>

<p>If your baby has a clear response in both ears then they are unlikely to have a permanent hearing loss. However, newborn hearing screening does not pick up all types of hearing loss and children can develop hearing loss later on. It is important to check your child’s hearing as they grow up. The checklist in your baby’s personal child health record (‘red book’) tells you how to do this. If you have any concerns about your child’s hearing tell your health visitor or <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the screening test results do not show a clear response from one or both of your baby’s ears an appointment will be made with audiology to see a hearing specialist.</p>

<p>About 2 to 3 babies in every 100 do not show a clear response on the screening tests.</p>

<p>About 1 in 15 babies tested at the audiology clinic have a permanent hearing loss in one or both ears. Some have a temporary hearing loss.</p>

<p>Finding out about hearing loss early gives babies a better chance of developing language, speech and communication skills as well as making sure their families receive the support they need.</p>

<p>A hearing specialist should see you within 4 weeks of having your baby’s hearing screening test. It is very important  you bring your baby to the appointment. This is because they may need other tests to find a possible cause if they do have a hearing loss. These tests should be performed within the first few weeks of birth.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Getting my results</h2>

<p>You will be given your baby’s results as soon as the hearing screening test is done.</p>
