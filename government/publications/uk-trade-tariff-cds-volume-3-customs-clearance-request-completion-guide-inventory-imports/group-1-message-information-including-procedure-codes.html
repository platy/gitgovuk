<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> purposes, a single goods item is defined as all goods being declared as a bulked release on a single <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration.</p>

<h3>C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentation">NOP</abbr>
</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentation">NOP</abbr> purposes a single goods item is defined as goods requesting release as a single consignment to a single customs procedure, for instance, goods destined to be delivered to the same customs warehouse. However, goods destined for release direct to free circulation would be classed as a separate goods item.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Each <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> may only be submitted for a single goods item, therefore, this must always be completed with a value of â1â.</p>

<p>This is only required when a paper <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or paper <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> is being submitted.</p>

<h3>Declaration Category <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The Representation status declared on the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration does not affect the liability of the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> authorisation holder for compliance with the terms and conditions of the procedure. The holder of the EORI declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 will retain a liability for the accuracy of the declaration being made as the holder of the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> authorisation. This liability is not affected by any agents, sub-agents, representatives or representation status declared on the declaration.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<h4>Paper Clearance Requests:</h4>

<p>Where paper-based clearance requests are concerned, the original of the handwritten signature of the person concerned must be given on the copy of the clearance request followed by the full name of that person.</p>

<p>In signing <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/8, a legal declaration is being made that the details shown on the form and any continuation sheets are true and complete and that the requirements of any legislation has been met.</p>

<h4>Electronic Clearance Requests:</h4>

<p>Where, as a result of declaration processing, it is determined that customs will accept a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> without the need for the presentation of the paper copy, the user identity used to lodge a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> with <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will replace the hand-written signature as the authentication credential for that clearance request.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> role identified by the user identity will determine the liability for all data transmitted in that <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>. In a paperless environment the user identity will have the same legal status as the hand-written signature on the paper <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Individual liability will rest with the signatory within the company for the use of that credential (for instance, the user identity). If there is to be a change of person who will act as signatory, this must be notified immediately to HMRC in writing, whereupon its records will be updated.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<h4>Authorised Signatories:</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> must be signed according to the following rules. If the importer is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An individual, by that individual or an employee who has been authorised in writing</li>
  <li>A partnership, by one of the partners, or one of their employees authorised in writing by a partner</li>
  <li>A company incorporated in the UK under the companies acts, by a director or the company secretary, or an employee of the company authorised in writing by a director or the company secretary</li>
  <li>A corporation incorporated in the UK by statute, by a person authorised by law to sign for the corporation, or an employee of the corporation authorised in writing by such a person</li>
  <li>A foreign firm or company, or a corporation incorporated abroad by statute, by a person authorised by the law of the country in which the firm or company, is established</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> may be signed on behalf of the importer by any firm, company or individual to whom the importer has given the authority to act as a declarant for customs purposes. The manner of authorisation is a matter of arrangement between importers and their declarant but, in giving authority to a declarant, the importer will be assumed to have given authority to the clerks and servants authorised by the agent to carry out all of the importerâs customs business. Customs may at any time require evidence that a declarant has been authorised by an importer to sign clearance requests on the importerâs behalf.</p>

<h4>Use of Representatives or Agents to submit the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> on the importerâs/ legal declarantâs behalf</h4>

<p>Article 5(15) of Council Regulation No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines the legal declarant as:</p>

<p>The person lodging a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> in his or her own name or the person in whose name such a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> is lodged.</p>

<p>Where the legal declarant (for example, importer) is completing the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> themselves under âself-representationâ, they shall be liable for the content of all <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declarations or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Requests">CCRs</abbr> so completed and submitted.</p>

<p>Article 18 of EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>) permits customs representatives to be appointed to act on another personâs behalf. This representation may be:</p>

<p>Direct: the representative acts in the name and of behalf of the other person. The liability rests with the original party (usually the importer). This is dependent on the representative holding appropriate evidence of their empowerment to act on behalf of the original party and can demonstrate that the original partyâs instructions have been followed.</p>

<p>Indirect: the representative acts in their own name but on behalf of another person. The liability is held jointly and severally between both parties.</p>

<p>Article 5(6) of Council Reg. (EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)) defines a representative as:</p>

<p>Any person appointed by another person to carry out the acts and formalities required under the customs legislation in his or her dealings with customs authorities.</p>

<p>A customs representative shall be established within the customs territory of the Union, except where the customs representative acts upon behalf of persons who are not required to be established within the customs territory of the Union.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declarations:</h4>

<p>The Representation status declared on the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration does not affect the liability of the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> authorisation holder for compliance with the terms and conditions of the procedure. The holder of the EORI declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 will retain a liability for the accuracy of the declaration being made as the holder of the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> authorisation. This liability is not affected by any agents, sub-agents, representatives or representation status declared on the declaration.</p>

<h4>Direct Representation</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as a âdirectâ representative, in the name of and on behalf of another person and is transmitting the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> under the representativeâs/ agentâs own user identity, the representative/ agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority of their powers to act. Failure to do so will result in liability resting with the representative.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>. The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Direct, code â2â.</p>

<p>Direct representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> to a sub-agent, and the sub-agent submits the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> on behalf of the first agent but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential; the sub-agent must hold (and be able to produce on request to customs) written authority to act and the instructions provided for the completion of the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> particulars. Failure to produce written authority will result in liability resting with the sub-agent. The sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (Declarantâs identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The representative originally contracted to complete the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> and formalities on behalf of the importer must be declared as the Representative on the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 (Representativeâs identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<p>The Representative retains responsibility for ensuring the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> is made in accordance with the instructions provided by the importer.</p>

<h4>Indirect Representation</h4>

<p>Where the representative or agent is acting as an âindirectâ representative in his/ her own name, but on behalf of another person, both parties accept joint liability for all data transmitted under the user identity. A representative or agent failing to state the level of representation on the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declarations or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> will be deemed to be acting in his/ her own name and on his/ her own behalf.</p>

<p>In this example, the representativeâs details would be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>. The Representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 would show Indirect, code â3â.</p>

<p>Indirect representation and sub-agents:</p>

<p>Where a representative/ agent delegates the making of a <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration and <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> to a sub-agent, in an âindirectâ capacity on behalf of the first agent (but using the sub-agentâs user identity as the authentication credential), then the sub-agent must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/18 (declarantâs identity) or <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/41 (Party presenting the goods) in the case of <abbr title="Entry in Declarants Records">EIDR</abbr> <abbr title="Notification of Presentations">NOPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The representative, originally contracted to complete the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> and formalities on behalf of the importer, must be declared as the Representative on the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> and appear in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/20 (representativeâs identity). The representative status declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/21 indicates the relationship between the representative and the importer, not the sub-agent and any other party.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> only</h4>

<p>The Representative retains joint and several liability with the importer for the customs debt.</p>
