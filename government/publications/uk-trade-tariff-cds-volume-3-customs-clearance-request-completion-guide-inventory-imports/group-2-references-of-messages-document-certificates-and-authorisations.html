<p>This Data Element (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr>) is mandatory.</p>

<h3>For import inventory linked <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declarations and Customs Clearance Requests (CCRs):</h3>

<p>The Inventory Reference Number (UCN) must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using the Document Category ‘Z’, followed by Previous Document Type code ‘MCR’ at header level.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This Data Element must always be completed to identify a previous declaration or previous document(s).</p>

<p>The completion of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is only mandatory at imports for CCRs where the goods are to be declared using Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>) or they are subject to an electronic licence control.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 using the Previous Document Type codes ‘DCR’. 
A previous declaration, or document, is identified by category, type, reference and the goods item number of the previous document. The goods item number element in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 may be omitted where the previous document comprised a single goods item.</p>

<p>The Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-inventory-imports-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1</a> give guidance on the codes expected to be used in specific circumstances for the procedure concerned. They are not a definitive guide however and should be read in conjunction with the full list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Each previous document entered in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1, is declared as an alpha numeric code (an..42), made up of four components:</p>

<h4>First component: Document Category (a1)</h4>

<p>The first component (a1) consists of a letter and is used to distinguish between the three categories mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the declaration for temporary storage represented by ‘X’</li>
  <li>the previous document, represented by ‘Z’.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Second component: Previous document type (an..3)</h4>

<p>The second component (an..3), consists of a combination of digits and/ or letters, serves to identify the type of document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose the appropriate code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/previous-document-codes-for-data-element-21-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 3: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1: Previous Document Codes</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, code: MRN (to represent the transit declaration ref no.).</p>

<h4>Third component: Previous document reference (an..35)</h4>

<p>The third component (an..35) represents the data needed to recognise the document.</p>

<p>Enter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identification number or another recognisable reference of the document</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the MRN of the transit declaration.</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Goods item identifier (n..3)</h4>

<p>The fourth component (n..3) is used to identify which item of the previous document is being referred to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The goods item number on the summary declaration, temporary storage declaration, transit declaration or other previous document.</li>
  <li>This should be separated from the document reference number by ‘-‘.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: 2 (to identify that this reference refers to the second item on the previous document).</p>

<p>Where the previous document referred to contained only a single goods item, this component may be left blank.</p>

<p>Please note that the item number to be declared in this component is the item number from the previous document. It is not the item number from the current declaration.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>On paper <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declarations or CCRs the details are separated with a dash in the format (category-type-reference-goods item no. (for example, Z-380-12345-1)).</p>

<h4>Electronic Licences:</h4>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> Completion Rules for <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> goods being released on a <abbr title="Customs Clearance Requests">CCR</abbr>:</h4>

<p>A <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> and the optional part must be unique and should comply with the rules and format as detailed in the ‘Recommended Format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>’ section below.</p>

<p>The declaration of a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is mandatory for <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP clearance requests. The same <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be supplied on all linked declarations, for example, <abbr title="Customs Clearance Requests">CCR</abbr> with any supplementary declaration.</p>

<p>It is important that simplified procedure traders enter their own declaration UCR numbers (DUCRs) into <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 Simplified Declaration/ Previous Document (third component using previous document type code ‘DCR’) as these are used to provide the audit trail between the <abbr title="Customs Clearance Requests">CCR</abbr> (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP entry), any linked supplementary declarations and any commercial documents.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is the main reference to the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> declaration for simplified procedures purposes and can incorporate commercial references so that there is a single reference for accessing all related information in trade and customs computer systems. The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must contain the EORI number of the simplified procedures authorised trader.</p>

<h4>Recommended Format, where required, of <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> for all CCRs:</h4>

<p>The recommended format of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> reference number in the UK is the WCO format, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ - is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2021. Therefore, for the year 2019, ensure the year component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered onto the electronic licence contains the single ‘9’ digit and not ‘19’. In 2020, enter the year as a single ‘0’ digit and not ‘20’.</li>
  <li>‘Country’ - is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated.</li>
  <li>‘EORI’ - is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character EORI number. This must be the EORI number of the simplified procedures authorised trader.</li>
  <li>’-‘ - is a dash.</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ - is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose EORI number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an EORI number ‘000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<p>The Data Element must be completed when an Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) statement is required.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Only Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) Code RRS01 (GVMS releases) may be declared at header level on the customs declaration. All other <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> codes must be declared at item level.</p>

<p>Where goods are being declared at a GVMS location (see Appendix 16S), a Goods Not Arrived (pre-lodged) Additional Declaration Type must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/2. Where the declaration has been pre-lodged because the goods are being released from a GVMS location, Additional Information Code ‘RRS01’ must also be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 and a GVMS location code from Appendix 16S declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 5/23.</p>

<p>Enter any Union and/ or National codes which apply followed by any free text information for the Additional Information (<abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr>) code as required.

<p>Up to 99 <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> codes can be declared at item level in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item comprises of both Union and National <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> codes declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2, any Union Codes (beginning with a number) must be declared first.</p>

<p>The Procedure Code and Additional Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-inventory-imports-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-c21i-de-111-additional-procedure-codes">Appendix 2</a> give guidance on the <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> codes expected to be used in specific circumstances for the procedure concerned.

<p>Where the document code completion rules in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-inventory-imports-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-c21i-de-111-additional-procedure-codes">Appendix 2</a> specify different rules to the main document code guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>, the rules specified in Appendices 1 and 2 take precedence.</p>

<p>Where a single goods item requires both Union and National document codes to be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, any Union Codes (beginning with a letter) must be declared first.</p>

<p>Each document type code has eight components: not all components are mandatory for all document codes.</p>

<h4>First Component: Document Type Code (an4) mandatory for all document codes declared</h4>

<p>The first component is a 4 figure Document Type Code. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a> for a list of document codes which should be declared in specific circumstances. The Document Code appendix should be read in conjunction with Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for information on which Document Codes should be declared in order to declare specific commodities or use specific customs procedures.</p>

<h4>Second Component: Document Identifier and Part (an..35), see additional notes on the second components format for licences in the section below</h4>

<p>The second component comprises of two sub-components.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 1: Document Identifier (an..30) mandatory for all document codes declared</h4>

<p>This sub-component is the document identifier. This is the reference number, as specified against the document type code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. This must identify the unique document, authorisation, licence or certificate being declared.</p>

<h4>Sub-component 2: Multi Line Document (Document Part) (an..5) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter the line item (part) as required for the particular document.</p>

<p>For example, some licences cover many products with each defined as a line. The document part sub-component is used to identify the line number when required.</p>

<p>If omitted it defaults to 1 and the attribution applies to the first (or only) line of the licence.
The line item number of the document is to be appended to the document identifier (completed in the first sub-component) separated by a dash (-).</p>

<p>For example: X0021234/16-3</p>

<h4>Third Component: Document Status Code (a2) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>The third component is a Document Status Code (a2).  A full list of the document status codes may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-status-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document Status Codes</a>.</p>

<p>The document status code should be declared, as specified, by each document code.</p>

<p>The specific document status codes which may be used with each document code is specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Certain document type codes (for example, authorisation numbers) will not usually require a status code to be declared and where applicable this is specified against the document code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>A ‘Document identifier’ and ‘Reason’ must still be input when a waiver status code is used.&nbsp; When declaring a waiver this can be entered as, for example, ‘Exempt’ in each field.</p>

<h4>Fourth component: Reason (an..35) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Reason where required by the Document Status Code.
A reason must be supplied for some status values. For example: Status code UP, reason entered “eaten by dog, replacement in post”.</p>

<h4>Fifth Component: Issuing Authority (an..70) conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>Enter a free text description of the Issuing Authority.  This should be specific enough to identify the governing body responsible for issuing the licence or certificate.</p>

<h4>Sixth Component: Date of Validity, if required (n8) conditional</h4>

<p>The date of validity, if required, must be entered in the following date format: yyyymmdd.</p>

<h4>Licences and non-preference certificates:</h4>

<p>The date to be declared is the expiry date for the licence or certificate. Where the Document Code for the licence or certificate is listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-and-other-reference-codes-licence-types-imports-and-exports-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types</a>, a date of validity must always be declared.</p>

<p>Electronic Licences:</p>

<p>Where an electronic licence is associated with a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> (for example DEFRA licences such as CHEDs), the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 at header level. To ensure successful matching, the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered to <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> should be the same as the one entered on the electronic licence.</p>

<p>For details of which licence types require a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> to be provided, please refer to Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types.</p>

<h4>Seventh component: Measurement unit and qualifier, if applicable: an..4 + conditional, see the specific document code completion notes for details</h4>

<p>This is only required where a specific quantity and measurement type has to be decremented against a specific document. For example, a licence has been issued for a total quantity of liquids in litres.</p>

<p>Where the specific document requires a measurement unit and/ or qualifier to be declared, enter the appropriate code for the commodity’s/ document’s measurement unit type using the list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measurement-unit-codes-for-data-elements-23-and-44-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 20: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/7 and 4/4: Measurement Unit Codes</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, enter the measurement unit code of LTR. The quantity of litres being declared should be entered against the eighth component: quantity.</p>

<p>If no quantity or measurement unit/ qualifier is required, this data element should be omitted.</p>

<h4>Eighth component: Quantity (n..16,6)</h4>

<p>Enter the quantity being attributed to the specific document identifier (second component). 
Any decimal places declared (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters available for this component. For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>For example, if the document requires a quantity in litres, the measurement unit code of LTR will have been entered in the seventh component (measurement unit), followed by the quantity of litres being declared as a value here, in the eighth component, for example, 12.05.</p>

<h4>Write-off amounts</h4>

<p>When declaring a waiver status code (XX or XW as appropriate) for the following document codes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>9005;</li>
  <li>9100;</li>
  <li>9101;</li>
  <li>9102</li>
</ul>

<p>a write-off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 with an amount of ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).</p>

<h4>Open licence types</h4>

<p>Please note that when declaring an open licence, a write off amount must be included in the seventh and eighth components of <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 for open licences.  The amount entered should be shown as ‘0’ after a recognised measurement unit (for example, ‘KGM0’).</p>

<h3>Authorisation for customs procedures</h3>

<p>If two or more procedures apply (for example OP and IP) the details for each should be entered as separate document references.</p>

<p>Authorisations are declared as a document reference in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3, using a document code from the list in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>. The authorisation should be declared in the format outlined in the example below.</p>

<p>Enter the authorisation document reference held to use a customs procedure. This code consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Code an4</li>
  <li>Country Code a2;</li>
  <li>Decision type an..4;</li>
  <li>Unique identifier for the decision an..29</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, for an authorisation for Entry in Declarant’s Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr>):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Document code</th>

      <td>The <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> authorisation number</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The corresponding EORI number of the authorisation holder should be declared against the appropriate authorisation type code in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39. The Authorisation Type codes may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/authorisation-type-codes-for-data-element-339-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 6: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39: Authorisation Type Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Authorisation document codes and authorisation holder EORI numbers in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39 are only required where a full authorisation is held.</p>

<p>The Procedure Code and Additional Procedure Code completion notes in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-inventory-imports-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-codes">Appendix 1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-2-c21i-de-111-additional-procedure-codes">Appendix 2</a> give guidance on the minimum authorisation document codes required to be used in specific circumstances for the procedure concerned. They are not a definitive guide however and should be read in conjunction with the full list provided in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<h3>Documents, Licences and Certificates:</h3>

<p>These document codes are only required where a document, licence or admissibility certificate has to be endorsed using the C21i.</p>

<p>A list of the applicable licence types and the document code to be used for each type may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-and-other-reference-codes-licence-types-imports-and-exports-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5C: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes: Licence Types</a>.</p>

<p>The completion rules for the specific licence or certificate which may be used for imports can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5A: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<h3>Status codes for Documents, Licences and Certificates:</h3>

<p>A status code must always be declared for these types of documents. Enter the appropriate status code for the type of licence from the list of the document status codes which may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/data-element-23-document-status-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5B: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Document Status Codes</a>.</p>

<p>The status must be permitted for the licence type and the commodity. The details of the specific status codes which may be used for each licence type will be specified against the relevant document code in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and Other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>This data element is for optional use by the declarant to record a commercial reference for their own purposes and may be left blank.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This field is not supported by <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> as a key to the clearance request and is in addition to any Declaration Unique Consignment Reference (<abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>), declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</p>

<p>Where a reference number is provided in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/4, it is recommended that the WCO format for the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is used.</p>

<h3>Recommended format for the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>:</h3>

<p>The format of the reference number may take the form of the WCO <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, which is created from the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Year’ - is the year in which the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated. For example, ‘9’ if allocated in 2019, ‘0’ if allocated in 2020 and ‘1’ if allocated in 2021. Therefore, for the year 2019, ensure the year component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> entered onto the electronic licence contains the single ‘9’ digit and not ‘19’. In 2020, enter the year as a single ‘0’ digit and not ‘20’. Where a <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is required for electronic licencing requirements, this must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1.</li>
  <li>‘Country’ - is the country where the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> was allocated.</li>
  <li>‘EORI’ - is the identity of the trader as known to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). In the UK this is the 12-character EORI number.</li>
  <li>’-‘ - is a dash.</li>
  <li>‘Reference’ - is a unique series of characters that the trader, whose EORI number is included in the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr>, devises and which provides an audit trail within traders’ commercial records. This component of the <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is restricted to numbers, upper case letters and certain special characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> is as follows: ‘9GB000000000000-12345’</p>

<p>This example <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> would have been issued in 2019, in the UK, for an EORI number ‘GB000000000000’, and with a trader reference number of ‘12345’.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This data element can be declared once at header and once per item.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Declaration Unique Consignment Reference">DUCR</abbr> must also be declared, as required, in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/1 (Previous Documents) using the previous document code ‘DCR’ for <abbr title="Entry in Declarant's Records">EIDR</abbr> NOP clearance requests.</p>

<p>The above requirement does not need to be met when deferment is only being used for other taxes</p>

<h3>Using more than one deferment account</h3>

<p>All the duty and tax may be deferred to the importer’s, declarant’s or representative’s account, or alternatively, the VAT and non-VAT charges can be split between the two different deferment accounts. When payment is being deferred to more than one deferment account, both deferment account numbers (<abbr title="deferment account numbers">DANs</abbr>) must be entered in this data element.</p>

<p>Please note, two deferment accounts cannot be declared when they both belong to the importer.</p>

<p>When two deferment numbers are present, only VAT amounts will be processed against the deferment account for ‘2DAN’.</p>

<p>All other amounts deferred will be processed against the deferment account for ‘1DAN’.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on which DAN (the importer’s, declarant’s or representative’s) is used for ‘2DAN’.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>A declarant/ representative acting on behalf of an importer must not use the importer’s deferment approval number without first being authorised to do so.</p>

<p>This authority may either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Specific authority: which relates to one particular consignment. Form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-deferment-of-duty-payment-c1207s">C1207S</a> must be completed by the importer and retained by the agent/ representative as evidence that they have authority to use the importer’s deferment account. This must be provided to customs on request. Document code ‘1207’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 (Document Codes) providing the date and location details as declared on the C1207S.</li>
  <li>Standing authority: Alternatively, an importer may give standing authority to their agent using form C1207N, which covers all consignments (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-101-deferring-duty-vat-and-other-charges">Notice 101 Deferring duty, VAT and other charges</a> for full details and examples on giving authority to use deferment accounts).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the clearance request is processed as a paperless clearance request, evidence of the authority must be retained at the trader’s registered premises (for 4 years) and may be subject to audit by customs.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is used to declare premises ID for goods being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Entered to a customs warehouse or</li>
  <li>Removed from a free zone/freeport.</li>
</ul>

<p>The premises declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 must have been approved by the UK(GB or NI) or one of the EU member states (NI only).</p>

<p>Enter the ‘Identity of the warehouse’, which is in two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type</li>
  <li>Warehouse identifier including Country Code</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not enter any separator or space between the two parts.</p>

<p>Separate clearance requests are required for goods subject to different Procedure Codes and entered to or removed from different premises. The Procedure Code notes explain these restrictions in more detail.</p>

<h4>First Component: Type (a1)</h4>

<p>Enter, as appropriate, one of the following codes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Code</th>
      <th scope="col">Warehouse type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>Public customs warehouse type I</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>U</td>
      <td>Private customs warehouse</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Z</td>
      <td>Free zone</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Second Component: Warehouse Identifier (including Country Code) (an..35)</h4>

<p>The warehouse identifier consists of two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identification number for the warehouse issued by the authorising member state</li>
  <li>The Country Code for the authorising member state</li>
</ul>

<p>In the UK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>customs warehouses have a 7-digit reference</li>
  <li>excise warehouses have a 13-digit reference</li>
  <li>the Isle of Man Free Zone is 0000006 - Isle of Man</li>
  <li>Freeports* should declare the identification number for the Freeport Customs site</li>
</ul>

<p>*The Freeport Business Authorisation number should be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3.</p>

<p>If the warehouse identity is not a UK allocated code (suffixed by ‘GB’), the premises name and address must be supplied as an <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> Statement in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/2 Additional Information, using <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> code ‘PREMS’.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>An example of a Customs Warehouse Identification reference number is R1234567GB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where R denotes a Type I public warehouse</li>
  <li>1234567 denotes the authorisation number for the warehouse</li>
  <li>GB denotes the authorising Member State</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of an Excise warehouse identity is YGB00001234567GB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where Y denotes a non-customs warehouse</li>
  <li>GB00001234567 is the 13-character excise warehouse identifier</li>
  <li>GB denotes the authorising Member State</li>
</ul>

<h4>For goods being entered to a customs warehouse or removed from a free zone/freeport:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>All the goods on a clearance request related to (re)import to customs warehousing or free zones/freeports must be entered to the same customs warehouse or removed from the same free zone/freeport (declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/7 (Identification of Warehouse)).</li>
