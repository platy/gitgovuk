<p>Where no revenue is to be paid or secured, <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/3 may be left blank</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter the appropriate tax type using the codes from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-types-for-data-element-43-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 8: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/3: Tax Types</a> for each tax to be paid or secured.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The Tax Type codes identify the kinds of duty or tax being declared (for example, ad valorem Customs Duty is declared using code A00, import VAT is declared using code B00).</p>

<p>Where revenue must be paid or secured prior to the release of the goods, a tax line must be completed on the C21i and a manual tax calculation declared.</p>

<p>The manual calculations made in conjunction with these taxes to be paid or secured must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 (Tax Base), 4/6 (Payable Tax Amount) and 4/7 (Total Taxes).</p>

<p>This data element is only required on a C21i where any revenue has to be paid or secured prior to the release of the goods.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>This data element is used to provide, for each separate tax type, enter the value on which the manual tax calculation has been based:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declare the measurement unit code: ‘GBP’ to indicate Sterling (£)</li>
  <li>Followed by the quantity: the value on which the tax calculation is based against each of the tax types declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/3, for example, the invoice value of the goods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Where revenue must be paid or secured prior to the release of the goods, a tax line must be completed on the C21i and a manual tax calculation declared.</p>

<p>For paper clearance requests: prefix any quantity with ‘Q’.</p>

<p>Any decimal places declared for the quantity (up to a maximum of 6 places) must be deducted from the total number of characters used in the data element. For example, if 3 decimal places are used, then only 13 whole numbers may be used in front of the decimal place.</p>

<p>Amounts declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 must be in GBP</p>

<p>Any currencies declared to Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) must be attached to a specific data element amount. The currency should therefore be declared with the appropriate data element amount.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘GBP’ followed by the tax base invoiced in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4</li>
  <li>‘GBP’ followed by payable tax amount in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/6</li>

<p>Where no <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> code has been provided and <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> identifies that revenue has to be paid or secured, <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will issue an immediate payment request.</p>

<h3>All Declaration Categories:</h3>

<p>Enter a Method of Payment (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr>) code for each tax type to be paid or secured.</p>

<p>The list of allowable Methods of Payments (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr>) and the codes to be declared for each may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/method-of-payment-codes-for-data-element-48-of-the-customs-declaration-service">Appendix 9: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8: Method of Payment Codes</a>.</p>

<p>A single <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> code must be declared for each tax type declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/3.</p>

<h4>Where the tax type has to be both paid and secured:</h4>

<p>Where a <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> code is entered to secure (or pay) a particular tax type, the equivalent payment method will be used to collect any outright payment (or security) due. For example, <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> code R (deferment account deposit) declared to secure the potential customs duty, the system will automatically collect any outright customs duty due from the same deferment account.</p>

<h4>Deferment:</h4>

<p>Where a deferred method of payment (code E or R) is used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the deferment account numbers (<abbr title="deferment account numbers ">DANs</abbr>) in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where deferred payment is being used to pay or secure Customs duty:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Codes C505 and C506 must also be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and</li>
  <li>Authorisation Type Codes CGU and DPO declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/39.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3 and 3/39 do not need to be completed when deferment is only being used for other taxes.</p>

<h4>Cash Accounts:</h4>

<p>When <abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> codes N or P are being declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/2 (Guarantee Type): Enter Code ‘Y’ where Cash Accounts are being used to pay/ secure the duties and other charges concerned.</li>
  <li>In <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 8/3 (Guarantee Reference): Enter the EORI number of the holder of the Cash Account being used to pay/ secure any duties and charges.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>Where revenue must be paid or secured prior to the release of the goods, a tax line must be completed on the C21i and a manual tax calculation declared.</p>

<p>When codes M or N are inserted, a deposit slip (form C&amp;E955) must be attached to the clearance request.</p>

<p>When code R is used, deposit slip (form C&amp;E955D) must be attached.</p>

<p>Failure to attach forms C&amp;E955 and C&amp;E955D could result in a delay in any future repayment. Document code ‘955D’ must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3. Please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/data-element-23-documents-and-other-reference-codes-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds">Appendix 5: <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 2/3: Documents and other Reference Codes</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence of VAT paid will normally be issued direct to importers in the form of a monthly VAT certificate form C79.</p>

<p>A declarant acting on behalf of an importer may not use the importer’s guarantee account (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr> U and V) without being authorised to do so. This authority may be specific (relating to one consignment) and be presented with the clearance request, or alternatively may be a standing authorisation, which covers all consignments.</p>

<p>If a declaration is processed as a paperless declaration, any authority must be retained at the traders registered premises (for 4 years) and may be subject to audit by customs.</p>
