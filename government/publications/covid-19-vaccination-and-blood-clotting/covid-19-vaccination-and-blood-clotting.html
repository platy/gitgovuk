<p>The UK vaccination programme has been very successful with more than 34 million people vaccinated and more than 10,000 lives already saved. The rapid rollout has meant that we have been able to protect more people and we are starting to lift the restrictions on our population. This leaflet is designed to help you make an informed decision about vaccination.</p>

<h2>What is the concern?</h2>

<p>Recently there have been reports of an extremely rare but serious condition involving blood clots and unusual bleeding after AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>) vaccination. Some people with this condition have suffered life changing effects and some have died. These cases are being carefully reviewed but the risk factors for this condition are not yet clear.</p>

<p>Although this condition remains extremely rare there is a higher risk in people after the first dose of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine. To date and overall, just over 10 people develop this condition for every million doses of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine given. This is seen more often in younger people and tends to occur between 4 days and 4 weeks following vaccination.</p>

<p>Similar conditions can also occur naturally, and clotting problems are a common complication of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. An increased risk has not yet been seen after other COVID-19 vaccines in the UK.</p>

<h2>Which vaccine will you be offered</h2>

<p>Until recently we have relied upon all our vaccines being offered without preference to the whole population. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) has considered the balance of risks and benefits and has now made the following advice (see <a href="#table" class="govuk-link">table</a> below for further information):</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">40 years </span> of age and older or with underlying medical conditions</h3>

<p>Older adults (including health and social care workers aged 40 years or older<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>), care home residents and adults of any age with certain medical conditions are at high risk of the complications of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) and the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that you should still receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The benefits of vaccination in protecting you against the serious consequences of COVID-19 outweigh any risk of this extremely rare condition.</p>

<h3>If you are a healthy person aged 30 to 39 years of age</h3>

<p>In the current situation the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has advised that it is preferable for people in this age group to have a vaccine other than <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. You are more at risk of the serious consequences of COVID-19 and will have the most benefit from being vaccinated if you are older, male, from certain minority ethnic backgrounds, in some occupations, or are obese.</p>

<p>It is important that you have the vaccination as soon as possible to protect you and to reduce the chance of passing on the virus. If the situation changes and you are offered the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination you may go ahead after you have considered all the risks and benefits. Please carefully consider the risk to both you and your family and friends of COVID-19 before making your decision (please see <a href="#table" class="govuk-link">table</a> below).</p>

<h3>If you are a healthy younger person aged 18 to 29</h3>

<p>Currently <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has advised that it is preferable for people under 30 to have a vaccine other than <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> because the risk from COVID-19 infection is so low. If you are offered the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination you may wish to go ahead after you have considered all the risks and benefits for you.</p>

<h3>About the second dose</h3>

<p>If you have already had a first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering this rare side effect you should complete the course. This includes people aged 18 to 39 years who are health and social care workers, unpaid carers and family members of those who are immunosuppressed. It is expected that the first dose of the vaccine will have given you some protection, particularly against severe disease.</p>

<p>Having the second dose will give you higher and longer lasting protection and tends to cause less of the common side effects (including short lived headache).</p>

<h2>What to look out for after vaccination</h2>

<p>Although serious side effects are very rare, if you experience any of the following from around 4 days to 4 weeks after vaccination you should seek medical advice urgently:</p>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li>blurred vision, nausea and vomiting</li>
      <li>difficulty with your speech</li>
      <li>weakness, drowsiness or seizures</li>
