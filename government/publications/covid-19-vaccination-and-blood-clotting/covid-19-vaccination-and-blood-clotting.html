<p>The UK vaccination programme has been very successful with more than 30 million people vaccinated and more than 6,000 lives already saved.</p>

<h2>What is the concern?</h2>

<p>Recently there have been reports of a very rare condition involving blood clots and unusual bleeding after vaccination. This is being carefully reviewed but the risk factors for this condition are not yet clear.</p>

<p>Although this condition remains extremely rare there appears to be a higher risk in people who have had the first dose of the AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>) vaccine. Around 4 people develop this condition for every million doses of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine doses given.</p>

<p>This is seen slightly more often in younger people and tends to occur between 4 days and 2 weeks following vaccination.</p>

<p>This condition can also occur naturally, and clotting problems are a common complication of COVID-19 infection. An increased risk has not yet been seen after other COVID-19 vaccines but is being carefully monitored.</p>

<h2>What to look out for after vaccination</h2>

<p>Although serious side effects are very rare, if you experience any of the following from around 4 days to 4 weeks after vaccination you should seek medical advice urgently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new, severe headache which is not helped by usual painkillers or is getting worse</li>
  <li>a headache which seems worse when lying down or bending over</li>
  <li>an unusual headache that may be accompanied by:
    <ul>
      <li>blurred vision, nausea and vomiting</li>
      <li>difficulty with your speech</li>
      <li>weakness, drowsiness or seizures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>new, unexplained pinprick bruising or bleeding</li>
  <li>shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you should do next</h2>

<h3>Over 50 years of age or with underlying medical conditions</h3>

<p>All older adults (including health and social care workers over 50 years of age), care home residents, health and social care workers (includes unpaid carers and family members of those who are immunosuppressed) and adults with certain medical conditions were prioritised in the first phase of the programme because they were at high risk of the complications of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) advises that you should still receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of vaccination in protecting you against the serious consequences of COVID-19 outweigh any risk of this rare condition. You should also complete your course with the same vaccine you had for the first dose.</p>

<p>If your first dose was with <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering any serious side effects you should have the second dose on time as you may still be at high risk of the complications of COVID-19. Having the second dose will give you higher and longer lasting protection.</p>

<h3>If you are a healthy person over 30 to 50 years of age</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that all adults in this age group (including health and social care workers) should still receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>The benefits of vaccination in protecting you against the serious consequences of COVID-19 outweigh any risk of this rare condition. You should also complete your course with the same vaccine you had for the first dose.</p>

<h3>If you are a healthy younger person aged 18 to 39</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> advises that all adults in this age group (including health and social care workers) should still receive any of the available COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of vaccination in protecting you against the serious consequences of COVID-19 outweigh any risk of this rare condition. You should also complete your course with the same vaccine you had for the first dose.</p>

<p>Currently <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has advised that it is preferable for people under 30 to have a vaccine other than <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. If you choose to have another COVID-19 vaccine you may have to wait to be protected. You may wish to go ahead with the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccination after you have considered all the risks and benefits for you.</p>

<h3>About the second dose</h3>

<p>If you have already had a first dose of <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine without suffering any serious side effects you should complete the course. This includes people aged 18 to 29 years who are health and social care workers, unpaid carers and family members of those who are immunosuppressed. It is expected that the first dose of the vaccine will have given you some protection, particularly against severe disease.</p>
