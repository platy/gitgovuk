<p>You must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-risk-food-and-feed-of-non-animal-origin-hrfnao-official-certificates">official certificates published on 23 November 2021 for high risk food not of animal origin (<abbr title="high risk food not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>)</a>. Do not use previous versions of the certificates.</p>
</div>

<p>This guide is to help traders complete certificates to export or move high risk food not of animal origin (<abbr title="high risk food not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>) from Great Britain to the EU and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The certificates give assurance that your product complies with the rules that apply to <abbr title="high risk food not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr>.</p>

<p>You need to complete one certificate in English and one in the language of the country you’re exporting to. You must send both certificates with your <abbr title="high risk food not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> consignment.</p>

<p>In this guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="international organisation for standardisation">ISO</abbr> means the international standard <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">2-letter country code</a> for a country</li>
  <li>Great Britain refers to England, Scotland, Wales, Channel Islands and Isle of Man</li>
</ul>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-high-risk-food-and-feed-of-non-animal-origin-to-the-eu-or-northern-ireland" class="govuk-link">guidance about exporting or moving <abbr title="high risk food not of animal origin">HRFNAO</abbr> to the EU and Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>To complete the certificates you can either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download and complete them manually - you should email the certificate to the local authority food competent certifying officer to sign</li>
  <li>use <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/tracesnt/login">TRACES NT</a> (also called the Integrated Management System for Official Controls (<abbr title="Integrated Management System for Official Controls">IMSOC</abbr>)) to complete them online</li>
</ul>

<p>You must cross out or delete statements that do not apply to the product you’re exporting. 
If you’re completing certificates manually, the certifying officer must initial and stamp anything you cross out.</p>

<h2>Notifying changes</h2>

<p>After you’ve completed both certificates and the certifying officer  has certified them, you must tell the local authority if there is any change to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignee</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/veterinary-border-control/designated-border-control-posts-bcps_en" class="govuk-link" rel="external">border control post (<abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>)</a> in the EU where the goods will enter</li>
  <li>date of transport</li>
  <li>means of transport</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not get a replacement certificate for these changes. The local authority will tell you what to do next.</p>
