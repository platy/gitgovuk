<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We have published details of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023">funding arrangements for the academic year 2022 to 2023</a> for students aged 16 to 19 and students aged 19 to 25 with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>This includes details of changes in 2022 to 2023 concerning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>national funding rates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high value course premium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>programme cost weightings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>disadvantage block funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>retention factor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advanced maths premium</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate 16 to 19 funding allocations using data that you returned previously. In this case, we are using primarily 2020 to 2021 data to calculate funding elements affecting your allocation for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The allocation calculation toolkit (ACT) shows you the data we have used to calculate your funding elements and lagged student number. You can use it to check that the factors and other values used in your funding allocation are calculated as you expect it to. This may highlight errors in your data returns and, therefore, instances where you might want to submit a business case.</p>

<p>You should submit a business case only after you have received and reviewed your allocation statement. The deadline for submitting cases is 29 April 2022, as published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations">allocations timeline on GOV.UK.</a></p>

<p>This guide explains the practical detail of how we have used your data within the 16 to 19 school and academy sixth form ACT to calculate the various elements of the funding formula for your institution. When we refer to schools and academies in this guide it includes schools, academies, free schools, studio schools, and university technical colleges.</p>

<p>For academies that return individualised learner record (ILR) data, we use the further education (FE) ACT template. These institutions should use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023/16-to-19-further-education-allocation-calculation-toolkit-2022-to-2023--2">FE ACT guide. </a></p>

<p>If you have any queries about the information in this guide, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">online enquiry form.</a></p>

<h2>Your 16 to 19 school and academy allocation calculation toolkit</h2>

<p>To show you how we have used your data to calculate the funding elements used in your 2022 to 2023 allocation, we have prepared a 16 to 19 school or academy ACT for you. The ACT includes 7 separate sheets.</p>

<p><strong><em>Information</em></strong> – a front sheet to confirm the contents of the file.</p>

<p><strong><em>Funding elements</em></strong> – a summary of the key elements calculated from your 2020 to 2021 census data that we will use to calculate your 2022 to 2023 funding.</p>

<p><strong><em>Programme</em></strong> – student-level data that shows information such as age, funding band, condition of funding status, and programme information such as programme type and core aim in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aims</em></strong> – the individual learning aims from your 2020 to 2021 census data return, identifying for each student which learning aim is the core aim.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lagged Students</em></strong>– student-level data that shows information such as age and programme start and end dates reflecting the students on the autumn 2021 census in learning in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glossary</em></strong>  a technical description of each column in both the Aims and Programme sheets of the workbook. You can use this sheet to identify the specific data fields we have used when looking at your data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Comments</em></strong> – a tool to enable you to add notes to the data on the Aims and Programme sheets when reviewing the information shown.</p>

<p>If we do not have a full set of 2020 to 2021 data for your institution, we will not produce an ACT file for you. In this case, you can still see how we make the calculations by reviewing our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023/16-to-19-further-education-allocation-calculation-toolkit-2022-to-2023--2">example ACT</a> which is available on GOV.UK alongside this guidance.</p>

<h2>What’s new in ACT</h2>

<p>We have made some changes to ACT this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>removal of the institution UPIN from the funding elements sheet, UKPRN is the sole identifier used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the 2022 to 2023 retention factor returns to being a calculated factor from the last full year’s data after using an average factor as per the 2021 to 2022 allocations based on the prior 2 years to mitigate the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the retention of students</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>addition of Disadvantage Block 1 Instances per student and supporting student data which is used in the calculation of the 16 to 19 tuition fund</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introduction of a flag to identify students on high value courses for school or college leavers so that they can be treated appropriately in the calculation of funding band proportions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T Level students are now identified within the ACT file, 2020 to 2021 was the first year of delivery for some institutions, these students have been included in the calculation of eligible students for the high value courses premium but have been excluded from the other elements, this supports the policy to only include T Level delivery once fully lagged</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T Level transition programme students have been identified within the ACT file in order to align them to the appropriate programme cost weightings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Features of the 16 to 19 revenue funding methodology</h2>

<h3>What data have we used in ACT?</h3>

<p>2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022 data from the school census return made in autumn 2021.</p>

<h3>Why do we use 2020 to 2021 data?</h3>

<p>Your 2020 to 2021 census data is the last full year set of data that you returned. We use it to understand the characteristics of your institution and its delivery.</p>

<h3>Why do we use 2021 to 2022 data?</h3>

<p>Your 2021 to 2022 data is the latest set of enrolment data. We use this to calculate the lagged student volume for your institution.</p>

<p>You can find a detailed description of data sources in the glossary sheet of your ACT.</p>

<h3>Who counts?</h3>

<p>We fund students aged 16 to 19, students aged 19 to 25 who have an EHC plan and 19+ continuing students. We include students’ 16 to 19 funded learning aims in the calculation of funding factors for your 2022 to 2023 funding allocation when the students count as a start for funding purposes in the 2020 to 2021 dataset. Students count as a start for funding purposes when they complete the appropriate qualifying period, which is based on the duration of the study programme.</p>

<h3>Table 1: Student qualifying period</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">study programme planned hours and planned length in-year</th>
      <th scope="col">qualifying period</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>450 hours or more</td>
      <td>6 weeks (42 days)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fewer than 450 hours  24 weeks or longer</td>
      <td>6 weeks (42 days)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fewer than 450 hours  2 to 24 weeks</td>
      <td>2 weeks (14 days)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Programmes with a planned duration of less than 2 weeks and students who are in summer schools (aged 15 or under with a start date on or after 1 June 2021) are not counted.</p>

<h2>Core aim and study programme type</h2>

<p>In the school census, you must identify a core aim when students are doing a vocational programme, or a mixed programme that has a vocational core. When students are doing an academic programme, including a mixed programme that does not have a vocational core, you do not flag any of the aims as the core aim. We use this information to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>determine whether the programme is academic, vocational, Traineeship, T Level or T Level transition</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>calculate programme cost weighting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>calculate the high value courses premium</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>calculate the level 3 programme maths and English payment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>calculate retention</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some instances, multiple core aims for a student are identified across the academic year; where this occurs, we use the most recent instance for calculation purposes.</p>

<p>We have identified issues with institutions either flagging a core aim for an academic programme, or not flagging a core aim for a vocational programme.</p>

<p>When institutions select a core aim that is one of the following types, we will count the study programme as academic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A level (excluding General Studies or Critical Thinking)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GCSE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International Baccalaureate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pre-U Diploma</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Free Standing Maths Qualification (FSMQ)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access to HE</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When institutions do not select a core aim for students whom we believe are undertaking a vocational study programme, we will attempt to identify a core aim rather than treating them as doing an academic programme. This will avoid a negative effect on the retention and programme cost weighting factors, which would result in a reduced allocation.</p>

<p>When we have identified a vocational student, who is missing a core aim, we have selected a core aim by first excluding general studies and critical thinking learning aims, and then applying the following hierarchy to the possible core aims to determine a single aim for each student:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>highest guided learning hours</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>highest retention status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>highest programme cost weighting factor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>minimum aim sequence number (the ESFA assigns a unique ID for each learning aim within a student’s programme called the aim sequence number)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The aims sheet within your ACT shows the aim type as returned in the census (column K), column L shows the adjusted aim type, this is used to determine the core aim for use on the programme sheet.</p>

<h2>The 16 to 19 revenue funding formula</h2>

<p>All institutions are funded in the same way to teach 16 to 19-year olds and high needs students up to the age of 25. Funding allocations for 2022 to 2023 are calculated using a funding formula.</p>

<h3>Figure 1: 16 to 19 funding formula</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/139756/Funding_Formula_Diagram.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Please note that it is likely that not all of the funding elements are relevant to your institution. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/funding-education-for-16-to-19-year-olds">overview of 16 to 19 funding</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>This guidance document has been simplified to only include detailed chapters for the elements of the funding formula above that have corresponding data in your ACT file. The areas not covered are listed below with links to further details on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Student numbers</h2>

<p>We measure the learning delivered by your institution by counting the number of students and looking at the size of their programmes.</p>

<p>We start by calculating your lagged student numbers to decide how many students should be included in your funding for 2022 to 2023. We have published the<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations#data-sources"> data sources and methods we will use</a> to calculate your lagged student number on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Your lagged student number is shown on the funding elements sheet in the student numbers table. The lagged students sheet shows which students are counted for the lagged number.</p>

<p>We include students in the lagged student number when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their enrolment status is either main or current (M or C)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are in national curriculum years 12, 13 or 14 or they are in national curriculum year 11 and were 16 or over at 31 August</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they remain on their programme long enough to qualify for funding</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your allocation statement will confirm your final student number.</p>

<h2>Student funding bands</h2>

<p>We fund at different rates depending on the size of the programme your students are studying, and in some cases their age, high needs status and whether they are studying a high value course for school and college leavers.</p>

<p>*For these purposes, the definition for an 18+ high needs student is where the census indicates that a local authority has paid element 3 ‘top-up’ funding for the student, through recording ‘true’ for the top up funding indicator. There is a column on the programme sheet ‘high needs student’ (column F) that shows which students are classified as high needs students.</p>

<p>** <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-value-courses-for-school-and-college-leavers-a-one-year-offer-for-18-and-19-year-olds">High value course for school or college leavers</a> provided additional funding for one-year in 2020 to 2021 to encourage and support delivery of selected level 2 and 3 qualifications in specific subjects and sectors for 18 year olds in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).  Where these students as on large qualifications (450 GLH) or more with an overall programme of at least 540 planned hours, they will be treated as a 16/17 year old for funding band purposes so will be counted as band 5. There is a column on the programme sheet ‘HVC SCL student’ (column G) that shows which students fall in to this category ‘Yes Band’.</p>

<p>Your ACT contains a table showing the distribution of students by funding bands based on your 2020 to 2021 data. Note that the allocation of proportions of students to funding bands is based on the annual planned hours that applied during 2020 to 2021 as shown in table 2. We use data from the programme sheet (column P shows the funding band) to calculate these volumes.</p>

<p>We will apply the proportions calculated from these volumes (also shown in table 2 on the funding elements sheet) to your lagged student numbers for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>For institutions delivering T Levels in 2022 to 2023 your funding statement will show students funded in higher bands than displayed in the ACT file. ACT shows delivery in 2020 to 2021 only not including T Levels, in your 2022 to 2023 allocation statement we will remove the number of T Level students attracting funding from band 5 and fund them at the appropriate higher band.</p>

<h2>Retention factor</h2>

<p>For 2021 to 2022 we used a weighted average retention factor to calculate your funding. This was a one year change, for 2022 to 2023 we will return to calculating retention from your data.</p>

<p>When calculating the retention factor, we first calculate a retention rate at student level. We use different criteria to calculate the rate, depending on the programme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>vocational programmes: students have to have completed or be continuing to study their core aim</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>academic programmes: students have to have completed or be continuing to study at least one of their academic aims</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>traineeship programmes: students have to have either completed or be continuing to study their programme aim or have withdrawn with a positive progression into full-time employment or education recorded</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Students on a 2 year programme who complete the first year, will count as retained in that academic year. We define completing the first year as still being in learning on the last Friday of June, that is 25 June 2021 in this case.</p>

<h3>Table 3: Retention criteria</h3>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Student retained and is recorded as completed</td>
      <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We use these values to convert your retention rate to a retention factor. This is because we recognise that there is a cost to your institution, and an inherent value to educating young people, even if they do not complete their course.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>We use your retention factor based on 2020 to 2021 data to calculate your 2022 to 2023 funding. You can see which of your students were retained on their study programme in the column ‘retention’ (column V) on the programme sheet.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>overall retention rate</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of students flagged ‘Yes’ in retention (column V) where funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>
      <td>÷</td>
      <td>sum of students marked ‘Yes’ in funded student (column H)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We then convert your retention rate to a retention factor.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Retention factor</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>( Retention rate ÷  2)</td>

      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can see the result of this calculation on the funding elements sheet in table 2 (cell F24).</p>

<h2>Programme cost weighting (PCW)</h2>

<p>This part of the funding formula reflects the fact that some courses are more expensive to teach than others. We use sector subject areas (SSA) to determine weightings.</p>

<p>We determine whether to apply a weighting, and if so, what the value should be, using the core aim for vocational programmes.</p>

<p>Academic programmes receive a weighting of 1 (ie no uplift) except where the programme contains 2 or more science A levels. Where this is the case, we give a weighting of 10%.</p>

<p>There are 5 weightings which provide an extra 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 75% above the base rate.</p>

<p>Columns W to Y on the programme sheet show the programme cost weighting for each of your students.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>You can see your overall programme cost weighting on the funding elements sheet in cell F25 on the Funding Factors and Instances per Student table.</p>

<p>The calculation of the overall programme cost weighting uses data on the programme sheet to weight the factors for individual students based on their programme size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we determine the funding band (column P) using the total planned hours in the funding year (column O), the age of the student (column B) and whether the student is a high needs student (column F) or on a high value course for school/college leavers (column G)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for students in funding bands 5 to 2, we derive a weighting value using set hours for each band, and we record this as the weighting multiplier in column R</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Disadvantage funding</h2>

<p>Disadvantage funding has 2 elements: one based on the home postcode of your students, the other based on prior attainment of your students in English and maths GCSE at age 16.</p>

<p>Your disadvantage factors are on the funding elements sheet in table 3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>block 1: economic deprivation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>block 2: prior attainment in GCSE English and maths</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Block 1: economic deprivation</h3>

<p>We determine whether to allocate disadvantage funding based on where your students live. To do this we look up their home postcode in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019.</p>

<p>The IMD is an official government index that uses education, crime, health, employment, and income statistics to tell us how deprived areas are. We assign an uplift to those students who live in the 27% most deprived areas of the country.</p>

<p>Column Z in the programme sheet shows the disadvantage uplift factor for each student. If a student is not eligible for block 1 disadvantage funding, this column shows 1.00000.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>You can see your overall economic deprivation factor on the funding elements sheet (cell F26).</p>

<p>The calculation of the overall economic deprivation factor uses the data on the programme sheet to weight the factors for individual students based on their programme size:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we determine the funding band (column P) using the total planned hours in the funding year (column O)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for students in funding bands 5 to 2, we derive a weighting value (see table 4) using set hours for each band, and record this as the weighting multiplier in column R</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate a weighted student-level disadvantage uplift.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>weighted disadvantage uplift (column AA)</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>weighting multiplier (column R)</td>
      <td>×</td>
      <td>student’s disadvantage uplift factor (column Z)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We then use the weighted student-level disadvantage uplift to calculate the overall block 1 disadvantage factor for your institution.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>block 1 disadvantage/ economic deprivation factor</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of weighted disadvantage uplift (column AA) minus sum of weighting multiplier (column R) where Funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>
      <td>÷</td>
      <td>sum of the weighting multiplier (column R) for all students who meet the funding eligibility criteria, (funded student = Yes in column H)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Block 1: economic deprivation (instances per student)</h3>

<p>We calculate part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund">16 to 19 tuition fund</a> based on the number of students from the 27% most economically deprived areas of the country based on their home postcode in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019. The other part uses the Block 2 instances per student.</p>

<p>Column Z in the programme sheet shows the disadvantage uplift factor for each student, where this value is above 1.00000 the disadvantage instance value in column AB is set to 1.</p>

<p>We calculate the disadvantage block 1 instances per student in the following way:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>disadvantage block 1 instances per student</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of disadvantage instances (column AB) where funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>
      <td>÷</td>
      <td>total funded students (where column H is marked as ‘Yes’)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The calculated instances per student can be seen on the funding element sheet (cell F27).</p>

<h3>Block 2: prior attainment</h3>

<p>Disadvantage block 2 provides funds to support students with additional needs including moderate learning difficulties and disabilities. We base disadvantage block 2 funding on low prior attainment in maths and English.</p>

<p>We use data from the 2020 to 2021 census to calculate the average block 2 instances per student to be used in the calculation of your funding.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>We look at the grades your students attained in GCSE English and maths by the end of year 11. We take this information from the census fields EnglishGCSEPriorAttainmentYearGroup and MathsGCSEPriorAttainmentYearGroup. We calculate for each student the number of instances where English and/or maths was not achieved by year 11. A student can therefore be worth a maximum of 2 instances.</p>

<p>The funding factors and instances per student table on the funding element sheet (cell F28) shows the calculated instances per student.</p>

<h2>Discretionary bursary funding</h2>

<p>16 to 19 discretionary bursary allocations are calculated to reflect financial disadvantage and student needs across the county.</p>

<p>Further details including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-discretionary-bursary-fund-indicative-allocations-2019-to-2020">narrated presentations to explain the methodology</a> which came in from 2019 to 2020 can be found on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Element 1: financial disadvantage</h3>

<p>We determine whether to allocate discretionary bursary financial disadvantage funding by looking at where your students live. To do this we look up their home postcode in the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2019 as we do for disadvantage block 1 funding. We assign an instance value to those students who live in the 27% most deprived areas of the country.</p>

<p>Column D in the programme sheet shows if the student is living in the top 27% most deprived areas and column AO shows the instance value for each student. If a student is not in the top 27% and does not qualify for discretionary bursary financial disadvantage funding or if the postcode is unknown this column will show ‘Not in top 27%’.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>This uses the data on the programme sheet to calculate an average number of instances per funded student.</p>

<p>We calculate this in the following way:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>

      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of financial disadvantage instances (column AO) where funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can see your instances per student on the funding elements sheet (cell F31).</p>

<h3>Element 2a: student costs - travel</h3>

<p>Element 2a student costs for travel provides funding to support students from the top 60% most deprived areas (based on IMD 2019) with their travel costs. We do not include residential students (where column E in the programme sheet = ‘Yes’).</p>

<p>Column D in the programme sheet shows if the student is from the top 60% most deprived areas. We show how we have calculated the instance value for each student in columns AP to AS.</p>

<p>If a student is not eligible for discretionary bursary funding to support travel, we will state why in the columns.</p>

<p>The maximum total instance value for a student is 1 (column AS on the programme sheet). We base the instance value on two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>rurality, where we class a student’s current postcode (column C) as a rural area we give an instance value of 0.5 (column AP)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the distance travelled between the student’s postcode for travel (column C) and the delivery location of their learning (column U, this will be your institution postcode), the table below shows the instance value given (column AQ) based on the straight-line distance between the two postcodes</p>
  </li>

<p>If the student is resident and learning in London, they are able to take up the Travel for London (TfL) offer; where this is the case, we will halve their instance value based on the above. Column AR on the programme sheet indicates where this is the case.</p>

<p>Column AS shows the student’s total instance value for travel.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>The calculation uses the data on the programme sheet to calculate an average number of instances per funded student.</p>

<p>We calculate this in the following way:</p>

<h3>Element 2b: student costs – Industry Placements</h3>

<p>Element 2b - student costs for Industry Placements - provides funding to support students from the top 60% most deprived areas based on IMD 2019 who are undertaking an Industry Placement via the Capacity and Delivery Fund or as part of a T Level programme from the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>Column D in the programme sheet shows if the student is living in the top 60% most deprived areas.</p>

<p>If the student’s study programme makes them eligible for Industry Placement funding via CDF (column AU) and they are from the top 60% most deprived areas, we will give them an instance value of 1 in column AV.</p>

<p>We will only allocate funding for Industry Placements to institutions who submitted an approved plan, opted in and meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-providers-delivering-in-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">criteria set out on GOV.UK.</a></p>

<h2>Level 3 programme maths and English payment</h2>

<p>We give extra funding to providers to deliver maths and English to students doing substantial level 3 study programmes and T Levels.</p>

<p>Students are eligible for additional funding in the first year of a level 3 programme when they have not yet attained a GCSE grade 9 to 4 (or equivalent) in maths and/or English, and their study programme meets at least one of these criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it includes at least 2 A levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it includes a level 3 qualification of at least 360 guided learning hours (GLH)</p>

<p>We pay an instance of funding for each subject in which a student does not hold a GCSE. This means that a student who has not achieved either English or maths will receive one instance, and those without both GCSEs will receive 2 instances.</p>

<p>We only pay the 2 year rate for students who are continuing at the end of the first year. Otherwise, we pay the rate for a 1 year programme. For the purposes of calculating this funding, a 2 year study programme is one that spans 18 months or more.</p>

<p>We use historic information from the latest full year’s data to determine which students are eligible for the extra funding. For the 2022 to 2023 allocations, we used data from 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-level-3-programme-maths-and-english-payment">maths and English study in level 3 programmes</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>We look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the level of study programme using the qualification aims taken matched to LARS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the study programme planned length to determine if 1 or 2 year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the prior attainment of your students attained in GCSE maths and English (we take this information from the census using English GCSE highest prior attainment and Maths GCSE highest prior attainment to determine if we should award instances</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where a student is on a qualifying level 3 programme, we calculate for each student the number of instances where English and/or maths was not achieved before starting their study programme (and whether they are on a 1 year or 2 year programme). A student can therefore be worth a maximum of 2 instances.</p>

<p>If a student is not eligible for the payment, we will state why in columns AH and AK on the programme sheet with further explanation on the glossary sheet.</p>

<p>We calculate the level 3 programme maths and English payment instances per student for 1 year and 2 year programmes for your institution by adding the instance values (shown on the programme sheet in columns AH and AK) for those students who meet the funding eligibility criteria (column H = Yes) together and dividing by the total number of funded students (column H = Yes). This gives an average instance value per funded student; we have shown the calculated instances per student in funding factors and instances per student table on the funding elements sheet (cells F29 and F30).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16 to </span> 19 Free Meals</h2>

<p>Free Meals in FE funding is available to 16 to 19 only academies and free schools and 16 to 19 only maintained schools.</p>

<p>We use the 2020 to 2021 census to identify which students to include in the 16 to 19 free meals calculation, those that are returned as free school meals taken in the academic year. We use the proportion of students taking free meals in the 2022 to 2023 calculation.</p>

<p>Where an institution is in scope for 16 to 19 free meals funding but there are no students eligible for and taking free school meals in 2020 to 2021 (shown as 0% on the funding elements sheet) we will use the proportion of students who received free meals in 2019 to 2020 to calculate your 2022 to 2023 allocation (if both years’ data show 0 students then we will use 0% for your allocation calculation). We will show the final percentage used on your funding statement.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>The calculation uses the data on the programme sheet to calculate the percentage of students taking free meals.</p>

<p>We calculate this in the following way:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>proportion of students on free meals</td>
      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of 16 to 19 free meals taken (column AT) where funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>
      <td>÷</td>
      <td>sum of funded students (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If your institution is in scope to receive 16 to 19 free meals funding you can see your proportion of students on free meals based on 2020 to 2021 census on the funding elements sheet (cell F36). If not in scope the cell will be populated with N/A.</p>

<h2>Maths and English condition of funding (CoF)</h2>

<p>Students who do not hold a GCSE grade 9 to 4, A* to C or equivalent qualification in these subjects must study maths and/or English as part of their study programme in each academic year. There will be an impact on your 2022 to 2023 allocation when these students are not enrolled on either maths and/or English GCSE or stepping stone qualifications (where applicable) in academic year 2020 to 2021, and are not recorded as exempt.</p>

<p>We have published full details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-providers-delivering-in-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">how we will apply the condition of funding</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The Condition of Funding Table on the funding elements sheet (students not meeting CoF, column F) shows how many students you had that did not meet the condition of funding in 2020 to 2021 compared to the total students. We have split the data by funding band.</p>

<p>You can see which students did not meet the condition of funding on the programme sheet (student meets condition of funding, column AN = No). We have derived this from the English/maths GCSE highest prior attainment, funding exemption and QAN details. Column AL shows the student’s English status and column AM shows their maths status. Where either of these columns equals ‘Doesn’t have and not studying’ or ‘Has Grade D and not studying’, the student does not meet the condition of funding.</p>

<h2>Capacity Delivery Fund (CDF) – Industry Placements</h2>

<p>CDF is to facilitate the build-up of capacity and capability to deliver substantial industry placements and to deliver such placements. We first paid CDF in the 2018 to 2019 academic year. The placements are for students on vocational and technical study programmes at level 2 and level 3. We recognise that the delivery of significant numbers of industry placements as part of T levels is a significant step change for the sector. As industry placements are a compulsory part of T levels, CDF funding is available for providers to build their capacity ahead of the roll out which started in 2020. We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-providers-delivering-in-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">further information about CDF</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Column AU on the programme sheet shows which students are eligible for CDF. Cell F54 on the funding elements sheet shows the total number of students eligible for CDF funding in 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>We will only allocate CDF funding to institutions who have students studying eligible programmes in 2020 to 2021 that have submitted an approved plan, opted in and meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-providers-delivering-in-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">the criteria set out on GOV.UK.</a>  The allocation statement will confirm the CDF funding. The allocation statement will confirm the CDF funding.</p>

<h2>High Value Courses Premium (HVCP)</h2>

<p>The High Value Courses Premium (HVCP) supports providers to increase the number of students studying substantial programmes in particular subjects.</p>

<p>The premium is £600 per eligible student.</p>

<p>We pay the premium for full and part-time programmes that meet 1 of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>substantial A level programmes – those including at least 2 qualifying A levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>substantial vocational programmes – those including a qualifying qualification of at least 360 GLH</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T Levels  (in the specified subject areas).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualifications-attracting-high-value-courses-premium">full list of the qualifications that qualify</a> for the premium.</p>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>The aims sheet shows the study programme qualifications for each student, column F shows if the qualification is on the qualifying qualifications list.</p>

<p>The calculation uses the data on the programme sheet to calculate the number of students qualifying for HVCP.</p>

<p>We calculate this in the following way:</p>

      <td>=</td>
      <td>sum of qualifies for HVCP funding (column AW) where funded student (column H) is marked as ‘Yes’ or ‘Yes T Level’</td>

<h2>Area cost allowance</h2>

<p>Some areas of the country are more expensive to teach in and the area cost allowance reflects this.</p>

<p>For schools and academies, we calculate area cost from the institution’s postcode.</p>

<p>There is more detail on the area cost calculation for geographically-dispersed delivery in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>  on GOV.UK.</p>
