<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide helps you understand how we have calculated your 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation and the factors that have been applied. The guide is for the 2022 to 2023 academic year and continues to use the 16 to 19 funding formula as the basis of your allocation.</p>

<p>We will base your funding allocation on lagged student numbers plus any agreed exceptions where relevant. Your allocation statement includes student numbers and other factors that affect your funding for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who this note is for</h2>

<p>This guide is for school and academy sixth forms that submit school census data, including special academies and special free schools. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">Separate guides</a> are available for further education institutions and special post-16 institutions. If your institution returns ILR data rather than census data please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">FE allocation statement explanatory note</a> when reviewing your statement.</p>

<p>When we refer to academies in this document, we are referring to all types, including free schools, university technical colleges (UTCs) and studio schools, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>The ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#Changes">changes for 2022 to 2023</a>’ section shows the changes to 16 to 19 funding in academic year 2022 to 2023 at a glance, and where the change is reflected in your allocation statement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Further advice and guidance</h2>

<p>We have produced this guide to walk you through your allocation statement.</p>

<p>It is important that you also refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 funding guidance</a> for 2022 to 2023. The guides will help you to understand how we have calculated your funding allocation for 2022 to 2023. We publish these guides on GOV.UK before the start of the academic year.</p>

<p>You should read this note alongside our detailed guidance on:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>If there is an error in your data</h2>

<p>The figures in the statement are your final funding allocation, which under normal circumstances will not be changed.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reduce or withdraw your allocation at any stage should issues arise through audit or other processes which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significantly affect the data underlying your allocation calculation</li>
  <li>significantly affect contract compliance, or</li>
  <li>if we believe that by making an allocation we will be putting public funds at risk</li>
</ul>

<p>By exception, we will consider evidenced and credible business cases from institutions where there has been a significant error in the data returned by the institution. If you wish to submit a case, please refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations#business-cases-for-major-data-errors">guidance on thresholds</a>.</p>

<p>This process does not cover business cases where high needs place funding has been determined by the<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs change place notification process</a>. The high needs place change notification process is now complete and we will not review any requests for changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Changes for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>On 27 October 2021, the Chancellor <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">announced a three-year spending review</a> outcome for 16 to 19 education, making available an extra £1.6 billion in 2024 to 2025 financial year compared with 2021 to 2022. This is in addition to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spending-review-2020-speech">£291m for 16 to 19 education in 2021 to 2022</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-400-million-investment-for-16-19-year-olds-education">£400m that the government provided in 2020 to 2021.</a></p>

<p><strong>National funding rate</strong></p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023#national-funding-rate-for-academic-year-2022-to-2023">national funding rate will increase</a> to incorporate funding for teachers’ pay grant into the 16 to 19 allocation. The increase will also help cover the cost of inflation and the delivery of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">additional hours</a>.</p>

<p>We will increase funding rates as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Retention factor</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We will revert to calculating this from data following an alternative approach for 2021 to 2022 allocations. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a> provides information on how we determine if a student is retained and how we calculate an institution’s retention factor.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Programme cost weighting</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>From academic year 2022 to 2023, we are making further increases to PCW factors in 5 subject areas. The subject area tier 2 codes and descriptions are as follows:</p>
  </li>
  <li>1.1 Medicine and dentistry</li>
  <li>1.2 Nursing, and subjects and vocations allied to medicine</li>
  <li>4.3 Transportation operations and maintenance</li>
  <li>5.2 Building and construction</li>
  <li>5.3 Urban, rural and regional planning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantage block 1</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the block 1 rate for students who are in care or who have recently left care will increase from £480 to £504</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantage block 2</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we will adjust the rate for disadvantage block 2 (which reflects the additional cost of teaching and supporting students who have low prior attainment) to take account of the change to GCSE results in 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the disadvantage block 2 rate will increase from £480 to £504 for students attracting the higher and FTE rate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the equivalent rate for students attracting the lower rate will increase from £292 to £307. The rate for T Level students will rise proportionally to £683</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advanced maths premium</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>we will continue to fund the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-advanced-maths-premium">advanced maths premium</a> in academic year 2022 to 2023</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High value courses premium</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>we will continue to fund <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-high-value-courses-premium">high value courses premium</a> in academic year 2022 to 2023. We will increase the uplift from £400 to £600, to further encourage courses with higher wage returns and support the Industrial Strategy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Industry placements: Capacity and delivery funding (CDF)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>for the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we have reduced the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements-capacity-and-delivery-fund-cdf-for-providers-delivering-in-the-2022-to-2023-academic-year">CDF</a> funding rate to £160 per qualifying student for both level 2 and level 3 students</li>

<span class="number">7. </span>Allocation statement 2022 to 2023 – detailed notes</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Special academies and special free schools post-16 funding</h3>

<p>The 16 to 19 revenue funding statement for special free schools and special academies includes <a class="govuk-link" href="#Highneeds">high needs place funding</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#Student">student financial support funding</a>.</p>

<p>See sections below for information on how these are calculated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>Core programme funding</h3>

<p>This section shows the various elements of the funding formula shown on page 1 of your 16 to 19 revenue funding statement and the resulting funding from the application of each. The dates on your allocation statement will show as ‘2022/23’. We have written the dates out in full in this guidance for clarity.</p>

<p><strong>Student numbers for 2022 to 2023</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>as set out in the student numbers section</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>National funding rate per student</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#%20Breakdown%20of%20funding">breakdown of funding by band</a> section</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Retention factor</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>retention rate = retained students ÷ total funded students</li>
  <li>retention factor = (retention rate ÷ 2) + 0.5</li>
  <li>calculated from the autumn census 2021 (full year 2020 to 2021 data)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Programme cost weighting</strong></p>

<p>The programme cost weighting used is the average for your institution, and has been weighted by the funded hours for each student. We base programme cost weighting on the sector subject area (SSA) classification for each student’s core aim. We calculate this from the autumn census 2021 (full year 2020 to 2021 data).</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantage funding</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Distribution">distribution of disadvantage funding</a> section below</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Large programme funding</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Large">large programme uplift</a> section below</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Area cost allowance</strong></p>

<p>Some areas of the country are more expensive to teach in than others, and the area cost allowance weights the allocation to reflect this. The area cost is normally based on your institution’s address, except for a small number of institutions that deliver provision in different locations where it is based on the delivery postcodes for that provision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the values on your statement are shown to various numbers of decimal places. However, we calculate your funding using un-rounded values. This may result in some slight differences when you work through the calculation yourselves</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>Student numbers</h3>

<p>This section explains how we have calculated the student numbers in your 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement. Some of the information set out below may not be relevant to your institution and therefore may not be shown on your statement.</p>

<p>If your institution returns ILR data rather than census data please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">FE allocation statement explanatory note</a> when reviewing your statement.</p>

<p><strong>Students</strong></p>

<p>We take this figure is from the autumn census 2021 (2021 to 2022 data), it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of students recorded as on roll (main or current main) on census day 7 October 2021 at the institution in national curriculum years 12, 13 or 14</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for some institutions, we have used a different student number methodology</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="number">7.4 </span>Student number methodology</h3>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a> has full details of how we calculate student numbers for different types of institutions. Our default approach is to base allocations on lagged numbers. The lagged approach applies when there is a reasonably consistent level of delivery over time and applies in most but not all circumstances.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the lagged approach include student numbers for new institutions, closing provision, transferred provision (including in relation to subcontracting), exceptional in-year growth, and in-year closures. In these situations we may remove an institution from the lagged approach at any point, which may result in a change to their funding allocation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Breakdown of funding by band</h2>

<p>This section explains how we calculate funding bands in the 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement. Further information about national funding rates can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a>.</p>

<p>In this guidance, ‘full- time’ means the 16 to 19 funding band 5, 4a or T Level bands, and ‘part- time’ means the funding band 4b or lower.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>T Level bands</h3>

<p>The following applies if you have T Level students. If you are not in receipt of T Level student funding please refer to ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#Mainstream">mainstream bands</a>’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Mainstream bands</h3>

<p><strong>Student numbers 2020 to 2021</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the student numbers for each funding band as recorded in your autumn census 2021 full year 2020 to 2021 data based on the definition of the bands that applied in that year</li>
</ul>

<p>Band 5 students are all students with annual timetabled hours of 540 and over, except students aged 18+ who are not high needs. For 2022 to 2023 band 5 students include students aged 18 who meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/high-value-courses-for-school-and-college-leavers-a-one-year-offer-for-18-and-19-year-olds#for-18-year-olds">high value courses for school and college leavers</a> criteria.</p>

<p>Band 4 students are split into 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4a is those students who are aged 18+, not high needs and timetabled for over 450 hours per year</li>
  <li>4b is 16 and 17 year olds and students aged 18+ with high needs who are timetabled for between 450 and 540 hours per year</li>
</ul>

<p>Bands 1 to 3 show all 16 to 19 ESFA funded students with timetabled hours in that band.</p>

<p>In addition, students in band 1 (up to 279 hours) shows the total number of band 1 full-time equivalents (FTEs) for the student numbers shown.</p>

<p>You can view the student level data behind each funding band in your allocation calculation toolkit (ACT). We have published guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2022-to-2023">how to use your ACT file</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the percentage proportions for bands 5 to 1 applied to the ‘total student numbers for 2022 to 2023’ shown in the ‘student numbers’ table</li>
  <li>
    <p>the values in this column are rounded to whole numbers and this may result in a slight difference to the ‘total student numbers for 2022 to 2023’ shown in the ‘student numbers’ table</p>
  </li>
  <li>the following applies if you have T Level students:</li>
  <li>the number of band 5 students allocated in 2022 to 2023 is adjusted to remove students funded in the T Level bands</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>National funding rate</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that, as described above, for the purpose of calculating the number of students in each funding band in the 2022 to 2023 funding allocation we have used data from your 2020 to 2021 full year data return.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For that purpose we have therefore applied the definitions of the funding bands in 2020 to 2021. The funding rates applied to the bands for the allocation calculation are the increased rates that reflect the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023#national-funding-rate-for-students-funded-via-the-16-to-19-funding-formula">new hours ranges</a> that apply in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Distribution of disadvantage funding</h3>

<p>This section explains how we have calculated the disadvantage block 1 and block 2 funding in the 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement. For more information on disadvantage funding please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guide</a>.</p>

<h4>Disadvantage block 1</h4>

<p><strong>Economic deprivation funding</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>we use the student’s home postcode from the autumn census 2021 (2020 to 2021 full year data) and the IMD 2019 to calculate the block 1 factor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The block 1 factor is an average across the whole institution, weighted by the funded hours for each student.
The uplift is applied to the programme funding total, up to and including the level 3 programme maths and English payment.</p>

<p><strong>Care leavers</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of successful 16 to 19 bursary fund claims for 2020 to 2021 for vulnerable students who were ‘in care’ or ‘care leavers’, at a rate of £504 per student</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total block 1 funding</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>‘ block 1 funding’ + ‘care leaver funding’</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disadvantage block 2</h4>

<p><strong>Total instances attracting funding per student</strong></p>

<p>The factor is based on the number of instances when a student does not have at least a grade 4 or C in GCSE maths or English at the end of year 11:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a student without a grade 4 or C in maths and English counts as 2 instances</li>
  <li>a student without a grade 4 or C in either maths or English counts as 1 instance</li>
  <li>a student with grade 4 or C (or above) in both counts as 0 instances</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the autumn census 2021 full year 2020 to 2021 data to provide the number of instances per student.</p>

<p><strong>Total funded instances</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>‘ instances per student’ × ‘total student numbers 2022 to 2023’ (Student numbers table)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Students attracting the higher rate (bands 4 and 5), the lower rate (bands 2 and 3), the FTE rate and the T Level rate</strong></p>

<p>The ‘total funded instances’ split between students attracting the higher rate (band 4 and band 5) and students attracting the lower rate (band 2 and band 3) according to the proportions in the ‘breakdown of funding by band’ table:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the following applies if you have T Level students:</li>
  <li>for students attracting the T Level rate the ‘total funded instances’ is determined by multiplying the ‘instances per student’ by ‘Total T Level bands’</li>
  <li>‘ number of funded instances in each band’ (higher, lower, FTE, T Level) × ‘block 2 funding rate’</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total block 2 funding / Total block 2 funding including T Levels</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the sum of block 2 funding</li>

<p>If you have T Level students  + ‘students attracting the T Level rate’</p>

<p><strong>Minimum top up if applicable</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>if the total disadvantage funding (‘total block 1 funding’ + ‘total block 2 funding’ or ‘total block 2 funding including T Levels’) for an institution is less than £6,000, disadvantage funding will be topped up to £6,000</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total disadvantage funding</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bursary adjustment in respect of free meals</strong></p>

<p>The following applies to maintained schools, academies and free schools that only deliver provision to 16 to 19 students.</p>

<p>We calculate each institution’s percentage share of the adjustment proportionally, using data which will inform an institution’s free meals in FE allocation in 2022 to 2023. That is the number of students eligible for and in receipt of free meals in FE in either the autumn census 2021 full year 2020 to 2021 data return or the autumn census 2020 full year 2019 to 2020 data return if no students were flagged as supported with free meals in FE in the autumn census 2021 full year 2020 to 2021 data return.</p>

<p>The total adjustment amount is £15 million so, if there are 100,000 free meals in FE students who inform 2022 to 2023 free meals in FE allocations, and Institution A recorded 1,000 of those students in their autumn census 2021 full year 2020 to 2021 data return, then Institution A will be in scope for an initial adjustment of:</p>

<p>1,000 / 100,000 = 1%  then
 1% x £15 million = £150,000</p>

<p>protection is then applied so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no institution experiences a reduction of greater than 25% of their 16 to 19 bursary fund allocation</li>
  <li>no institution experiences a reduction that is greater than the reduction applied in 2021 to 2022, and</li>
  <li>no institution has a 16 to 19 bursary fund allocation of less than £500</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Discretionary bursary fund</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>the sum of each bursary funding element before transition arrangements are applied</li>
</ul>

<p>‘ element 1: financial disadvantage total’ + ‘element 2a: student costs travel total’ + ‘element 2b: student costs industry’   -   ’bursary adjustment in respect of free meals’</p>

<p><strong>2019 to 2020 Discretionary bursary funding – baseline for transition</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>your final, total 2019 to 2020 bursary allocation will again be used as a baseline to calculate the transition lower and upper limits (-/+ 75%). The transition lower and upper limits were +/- 50% in 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transition lower limit</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>in 2022 to 2023, institutions will receive no less than 75% of the baseline for transition amount following the change to the methodology</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transition upper limit</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>in 2022 to 2023, institutions will receive no more than 175% of the baseline for transition amount following the change to the methodology</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exceptional adjustment</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>an increase or decrease applied to your discretionary bursary funding. This could relate to funding to help students on the current ESF not in education, employment or training (NEET) programme, merger adjustments, converter adjustments and so on</li>
