<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide helps you understand how we have calculated your 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<h2>Who this note is for</h2>

<p>This guide is for special post-16 institutions (SPIs).</p>

<p>In relation to delivery for 2021 to 2022, you should also refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-allocations-supporting-documents-for-2021-to-2022">separate guides</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 funding guidance for 2021 to 2022</a>. Further information regarding the high needs funding system is available in the publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">High needs funding arrangements 2022 to 2023</a></p>

<p>The ‘changes for 2022 to 2023’ section shows the changes in academic year 2022 to 2023 at a glance and where the changes are reflected in your allocation statement.</p>

<h2>Further advice and guidance</h2>

<p>We have produced this guide to walk you through your allocation statement.</p>

<p>It is important that you also refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 funding guidance</a> for 2022 to 2023. The guides will help you to understand how we have calculated your funding allocation for 2022 to 2023. We publish these guides on GOV.UK before the start of the academic year.</p>

<p>You should read this note alongside our detailed guidance on:</p>

</ul>

<h2>If there is an error in your data</h2>

<p>The figures in the statement are your final funding allocation which, under normal circumstances, will not be changed.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reduce or withdraw your allocation at any stage should issues arise through audit or other processes which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>significantly affect the data underlying your allocation calculation</li>
  <li>significantly affect contract compliance, or</li>
  <li>leads us to believe that by making an allocation we will be putting public funds at risk</li>
</ul>

<p>By exception, we will consider evidenced and credible <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations#business-cases-for-major-data-errors">business cases</a> from institutions where there has been a significant error in the data returned by the institution.</p>

<p>Please be aware that once you have submitted your 2021 to 2022 individualised learner record (ILR) R14 data in October 2022, we will use this to check the accuracy of the R06 data, which was used to calculate your allocated student numbers. If, using the R14 data, we determine that your R06 data was materially inaccurate, you should expect to have your allocation reduced in-year. These checks and potential reductions will apply to both elements 1 and 2.</p>

<p>In addition, we will use your academic year 2021 to 2022 R06 return to calculate local authority import/export adjustments for the financial year 2022 to 2023. Local authorities will have the opportunity to review the number of high needs students you have recorded in your data and, if we determine that your R06 data was materially inaccurate because of an enquiry raised by a local authority, you should expect to have your element 2 allocation for high needs students reduced in-year.</p>

<p>Please note that, for funding purposes, the definition of a high needs student is one where the institution is receiving top-up funding from a local authority because the authority has agreed that the student’s additional support costs are in excess of £6,000.</p>

<h2>Enquiries</h2>

<p>If you have any questions that we do not cover in this or other published guidance, please contact us using our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">online enquiry form</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>On 27 October 2021, the Chancellor <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents">announced a three-year spending review</a> outcome for 16 to 19 education, making available an extra £1.6 billion in the 2024 to 2025 financial year compared with 2021 to 2022. This is in addition to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/spending-review-2020-speech">£291m for 16 to 19 education in 2021 to 2022</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-400-million-investment-for-16-19-year-olds-education">£400m that the government provided in 2020 to 2021.</a></p>

<p><strong>National funding rate</strong></p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-information-for-2022-to-2023#national-funding-rate-for-academic-year-2022-to-2023">national funding rate will increase</a> to incorporate funding for teachers’ pay grant into the 16 to 19 allocation. The increase will also help cover the cost of inflation and the delivery of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">additional hours</a>.</p>

  <li>we will adjust the rate for disadvantage block 2 (which reflects the additional cost of teaching and supporting students who have low prior attainment) to take account of the change to GCSE results in 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage block 2 rate will increase from £480 to £504 for students attracting the higher and full-time equivalent (FTE) rate. The equivalent rate for students attracting the lower rate will increase from £292 to £307. The rate for T Level students will rise proportionally to £683.</p>

<h2>Special post-16 institution funding allocation</h2>

<p>SPIs who will be delivering their first year of ESFA funded provision are currently completing the ESFA high needs due diligence process and, where successful, we expect to issue allocations to them by the end of June 2022. For these SPIs, we will allocate programme funding (element 1) and high needs funding (element 2) using the place numbers returned to us by local authorities through the<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">2022 to 2023 high needs place change notification process</a>.</p>

<p>For SPIs who will be delivering at least their second year of ESFA funded provision, we will allocate programme funding (element 1) and high needs funding (element 2) using counts of valid students from 2021 to 2022 ILR R06 data returns. We will use a reference date of 1 February 2022.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we will continue to use the 16 to 19 national funding formula to calculate programme funding (element 1) for SPIs.</p>

<p>For all SPIs, the total high needs place number allocation (element 2) is described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#_Table_5:_High">table 5</a> of the funding statement.</p>

<h2>Where student numbers exceed allocated places</h2>

<ul>
  <li>most other further education (FE) institutions and independent learning providers (ILP) have a single ‘provider local authority’ responsible for returning to ESFA, the number of element 2 places required for all the institution’s high needs students in the following academic year</li>
  <li>in the case of SPIs, however, ESFA is responsible for determining the allocations of both element 1 and element 2, and does so based on the prior year’s ILR data</li>
  <li>element 2 funding is initially included within local authorities’ overall high needs allocations. The national funding formula that calculates local authorities’ allocations includes adjustments, also based on ILR data, that remove from their final dedicated schools grant allocations the element 2 £6,000 per high needs place</li>
  <li>this means that ESFA is acting like the ‘provider local authority’ and is responsible for considering the need for further funding where the actual number of high needs students exceeds the high needs places that have been funded; although, in normal circumstances, the lagged funding methodology will fund SPIs for any additional students in the following year</li>
  <li>where local authorities place, in SPIs, significantly more students compared to their allocated places, the ESFA may, exceptionally, increase allocations in-year. In these circumstances, we will review the student numbers recorded in in-year ILR data returns. As this is a data driven exercise, it is not necessary for SPIs to submit a business case</li>
  <li>we will also consider under-delivery at the institution in the previous year and the national picture of placements. We will base any additional funding on a standard threshold determined by affordability. It is possible that we will calculate additional funding using marginal rates. We may also require additional eligibility or audit checks before allocating any additional funding. Institutions receiving exceptional in-year funding will be notified by April 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programme funding formula</h2>

<p>This section shows the various elements of the funding formula that apply to SPI funding allocations shown on page 1 of your allocation statement and the resulting funding from the application of each. The dates on your allocation statement will show as ‘2021/22’. We have written the dates in full in this guidance for clarity.</p>

<h3>Retention factor</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this remains 0.983. This was the average factor used in calculating 2021 to 2022 allocations for SPIs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Programme cost weighing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this remains 1.054. This was the average factor used in calculating 2021 to 2022 allocations for SPIs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Level 3 programme maths and English payment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>as set out in the level 3 programme maths and English payment section</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantage funding – block</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this remains 3.80%. This was the average factor used in calculating 2021 to 2022 allocations for SPIs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantage funding – block 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a default value of 2 instances per student has been used for all SPIs, which attract the £504 funding rate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Large programme funding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>not applicable to SPIs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Area cost allowance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>some areas of the country are more expensive to teach in than others and the area cost weights the allocation to reflect this. Area cost is calculated either from the head office location of the institution or from the delivery location of the learning in that institution, depending on the geographical spread of provision.</li>
</ul>

<p>The values on your statement are rounded to various numbers of decimal places. However, we calculate your funding using un-rounded values. This may result in some slight differences when you work through the calculation yourselves.</p>

<h2>Student numbers</h2>

<p>This section explains how we have calculated the student numbers in your 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement. Student numbers include students aged 19 to 24 with education, health and care plans.</p>

<h2>Student number methodology</h2>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-rates-and-formula">funding rates and formula guidance</a> has full details of how we calculate student numbers for different types of institutions. Our default approach is to base allocations on lagged numbers. The lagged approach applies when there is a reasonably consistent level of delivery over time and applies in most but not all circumstances.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the lagged approach include student numbers for new institutions, closing provision, transferred provision (including in relation to subcontracting), exceptional in-year growth, and in-year closures. In these situations we may remove an institution from the lagged approach at any point, which may result in a change to their funding allocation.</p>

<h2>Breakdown of funding by band</h2>

<h2>High needs funding</h2>

<p>This section explains how we have calculated high needs funding in the 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement.</p>

<p>We have based allocations of high needs place funding on your 2021 to 2022 R06 ILR.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2021 to </span> 2022 R06 total high needs students</h3>

<ul>
  <li>this is the high needs student number count split by age 16 to 19 years and 19 to 24 years, as recorded in the 2021 to 2022 ILR R06 data return, with a reference date of 1 February 2022</li>

  <li>‘2021 to 2022 R06 Total High Needs Student proportions by age’ is applied to calculate ‘High Needs Element 2’ (age 16 to 19 students) and ‘High Needs Element 2’ (age 19 to 24 students)</li>
  <li>‘High Needs Element 2’ (total students) £6,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Student financial support funding</h2>

<p>This section explains how we have calculated student financial support funding in the 16 to 19 revenue funding allocation statement.</p>

<h3>Number of funded students</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the ‘total student numbers for 2022 to 2023’ shown in the ‘student numbers’ table</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instances per student</h3>

<ul>
  <li>we use the SPI average for the instances per student value</li>
  <li>the average for ‘element 1: financial disadvantage’ is 0.26621</li>
  <li>the average for ‘element 2a: student costs – travel’ is 0.13985</li>
  <li>the maximum ‘instances per student’ value is 1.000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Number of instances</h3>

<ul>
  <li>instances per student for ‘element 1: Financial disadvantage’ and ‘element 2a: student costs – travel’ are multiplied by the ‘number of funded students’</li>
  <li>‘instances per student’ x ‘number of funded students’</li>
  <li>no SPIs will receive ‘element 2b - student costs for industry placements’ funding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rate</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the funding rate for each element of the discretionary bursary for 2022 to 2023. Bursary funding rates are subject to change year on year</li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>‘number of instances’ x ‘rate’</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bursary adjustment in respect of free meals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We calculate each institution’s percentage share of the adjustment proportionally, using data which will inform an institution’s free meals in FE allocation in 2022 to 2023. That is the number of students eligible for and in receipt of free meals in FE in either the2020 to 2021 ILR R14 data return or the 2019 to 2020 ILR R14 data return if no students were flagged as supported with free meals in FE in the 2020 to 2021 ILR R14 data return.</li>
</ul>

<p>The total adjustment amount is £15 million so, if there are 100,000 free meals in FE students who inform 2022 to 2023 free meals in FE allocations, and Institution A recorded 1,000 of those students in their 2020 to 2021 ILR R14 data, then Institution A will be in scope for an initial adjustment of:</p>

<p>1,000 / 100,000 = 1%  then</p>

<p>1% x £15 million = £150,000</p>

<p>Protection is then applied so that no institution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>experiences a reduction of greater than 25% of their 16 to 19 bursary fund allocation</li>
  <li>experiences a reduction that is greater than the reduction applied in 2021 to 2022, and</li>
  <li>has a 16 to 19 bursary fund allocation of less than £500</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discretionary bursary fund</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the sum of each bursary element before transition arrangements are applied</li>
  <li>‘element 1: financial disadvantage total’ + ‘element 2a: student costs travel total’ + ‘element 2b: student costs industry placements’ - ‘bursary adjustment in respect of free meals’</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2019 to </span> 2020 discretionary bursary funding – baseline for transition</h3>

<ul>
  <li>your final, total 2019 to 2020 bursary allocation, , will again be used as a baseline to calculate the transition lower and upper limits (-/+75%). The transition lower and upper limits were +/- 50% in 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transition lower limit</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In 2022 to 2023, institutions will receive no less than 25% of the baseline transition amount following the change to the methodology</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transition upper limit</h3>

<ul>
  <li>175% of the baseline for transition amount. In 2022 to 2023 institutions will receive no more than 175% of the baseline for transition amount following the change to the methodology</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exceptional adjustment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>an increase or decrease applied to your discretionary bursary funding. This could relate to funding to help students on the current European Social Fund (ESF) not in education, employment or training (NEET) programme, merger adjustments, converter adjustments, etc</li>

<h3>Free meals higher rate, lower rate and FTE Rate</h3>

<ul>
  <li>‘free meal students’ at higher, lower and FTE rates are determined by taking the proportions in table 1b and applying the percentage proportions to the ‘total students in 2022 to 2023 funded for free meals’. For SPIs, all students attract the higher rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Free meals funding</h3>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>‘free meals funding’ higher + ‘free meals funding’ lower + ‘free meals funding’ FTEs + ‘free meals administration’ + ‘exceptional adjustment’</p>

<h3>Total student support funding</h3>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>as the employer contribution rate changed prior to the 2020 to 2021 financial year, the figure has been adjusted to reflect what the contributions would have been if a rate of 16.4% had remained</p>
