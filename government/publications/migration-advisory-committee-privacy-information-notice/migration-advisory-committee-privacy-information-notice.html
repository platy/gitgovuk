<h2>Personal information we collect</h2>

<p>We currently collect and process the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what you tell us about yourself (for example, name and contact details)</li>
  <li>what we learn about you as you engage with the <abbr title="Migration Advisory Committee">MAC</abbr>, and</li>
  <li>what others share with us to fulfil their legal obligations or help prevent abuse of the immigration system and/or prevent and detect crime</li>
</ul>

<p>It also covers what information we may share with other organisations.</p>

<h2>How we get the personal information and why we have it</h2>

<p>Most of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policy analysis</li>
  <li>research</li>
  <li>stakeholder engagement</li>
  <li>staffing and personnel management</li>
</ul>

<p>Or processed as part of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>performing a public task</li>
</ul>

<p>We are only allowed to use, gather, and share personal information where we have an appropriate lawful basis to do so under the UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) or the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Migration Advisory Committee">MAC</abbr> collects and processes personal information to fulfil its official functions. We will only use personal information when the law allows us to and where it is necessary and proportionate to do so.</p>

<p>The lawful basis for the processing of your data will, in most cases, be Article 6(1)(e) of the (UK GDPR) – that is, that the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>

<p>At points, we also process special categories of personal data on the basis of Article 9(2)(g) of the UK GDPR, where the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. This may include information about political beliefs, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and biometrics.</p>

<p>If we have asked you to provide your consent, in order to process your personal data, you also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. When we ask for your consent, we will tell you how we will process your data, how long we will keep it for and the steps we will take to delete it. We will also outline the steps we will take if you decide to withdraw consent and explain your data protection rights.</p>

<p>Examples of ways in which we may process your personal information include when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you submit a response to a <abbr title="Migration Advisory Committee">MAC</abbr> Call for Evidence or attend a <abbr title="Migration Advisory Committee">MAC</abbr> stakeholder event</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also request information from third parties. For example, this might be for the purposes of research and analysis. This may involve, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>obtaining data relevant to policy formation from the Home Office</li>
  <li>obtaining data from other government departments – these may include HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department for Education (DfE)</li>
</ul>

<p>We may share this information with other third parties with whom we have directly contracted to undertake relevant work for a time-limited and specific purpose.</p>

<p>We may use your personal information (for example, email address and mobile number) to contact you regarding research related to immigration matters, analysis, stakeholder events or to follow-up on information you have provided to us.</p>

<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:</p>

<p>(a) Your consent. You can remove your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mac@homeoffice.gov.uk">mac@homeoffice.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>(b) We need it to perform a public task</p>

<h2>How we store your personal information</h2>

<p>Your information is securely stored on appropriately accredited secure systems. We have a duty to safeguard and ensure the security of your personal information. We do that by having systems and policies in place to limit access to your information and prevent unauthorised disclosure. Staff who access personal information must have appropriate security clearance and a business need for accessing the information, and their activity is subject to audit and review.</p>

<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary, for the permitted purposes it was collected for. We will then dispose your information by deleting the data. We continue to keep retention periods under review.</p>
