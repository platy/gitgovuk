<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>About this document</h3>

<p>This document is part of a suite of documents which sets out the regulatory requirements for awarding organisations offering GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1).</p>

<p>We have developed these requirements with the intention that GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1) should fulfil the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To provide evidence of students’ achievements against demanding and fulfilling content;</li>
  <li>To provide a strong foundation for further academic and vocational study and for employment; and</li>
  <li>To provide (if required) a basis for schools and colleges to be held accountable for the performance of all of their students.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements set out in this document</h3>

<p>This document sets out the GCSE Qualification Level Conditions. These conditions apply to all GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1).</p>

<p>It sets out our requirements in relation to setting specified levels of attainment for GCSE qualifications (graded from 9 to 1) – awarding organisations must comply with these requirements under Condition GCSE9.1. It also sets out our requirements in relation to specifying deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals – awarding organisations must comply with these requirements under Conditions GCSE14.3(b), GCSE17.3(b) and GCSE18.4(b).</p>

<p>With respect to these qualifications, awarding organisations must also comply with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ofqual-handbook/">General Conditions of Recognition</a>, which apply to all awarding organisations and qualifications</li>
  <li>the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gcses-9-to-1-requirements-and-guidance">GCSE Subject Level Conditions</a>, including those which apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-subject-level-conditions-for-2022">qualifications taken by Learners in 2022</a>
</li>

<h2>Advance information principles</h2>

<h3>Principles in relation to advance information for Assessments by Examination in 2022</h3>

<p>Condition GCSE4.6 allows us to specify principles in relation to information about the content which will be assessed for advance information qualifications for Assessments by Examination in 2022.</p>

<p>We set out below our principles for the purposes of Condition GCSE4.6:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The advance information should not be so detailed that Learners are able to memorise answers to write in the exam.</li>
  <li>The advance information should not be so extensive or specific that it will damage a Learner’s progression to higher level qualifications in the subject.</li>
  <li>It should still be possible to differentiate between Learners on the basis of their performance.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Standard setting requirements</h2>

<h3>Requirements in relation to the specified levels of attainment to be used for GCSE Qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition GCSE3.1 allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the setting of specified levels of attainment for GCSE Qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out below our requirements for the purposes of Condition GCSE3.1.</p>

<h4>Specified levels of attainment for GCSE Qualifications other than double award qualifications</h4>

<p>Except as provided for in the Subject Level Conditions and Requirements <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> for a GCSE Qualification which it makes available, other than a GCSE double award qualification, an awarding organisation must ensure that the specified levels of attainment take the form of a nine-point scale from 9 to 1, where 9 represents the highest level of attainment.</p>

<p>A Learner who does not meet the criteria to be awarded a specified level of attainment on the nine-point scale must be issued with a result of ‘unclassified’.</p>

<h4>Specified levels of attainment for GCSE double award qualifications</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the specified levels of attainment for a GCSE double award qualification which it makes available take the form of a 17-point scale in the following format, with 9-9 representing the highest level of attainment –</p>

<p>9-9, 9-8, 8-8, 8-7, 7-7, 7-6, 6-6, 6-5, 5-5, 5-4, 4-4, 4-3, 3-3, 3-2, 2-2, 2-1, 1-1</p>

<p>A Learner who does not meet the criteria to be awarded a specified level of attainment on the above scale must be issued with a result of ‘unclassified’.</p>

<h3>Requirements for setting specified levels of attainment for GCSE Qualifications</h3>

<p>Condition GCSE9.1(b) allows us to specify requirements and guidance in relation to the setting of specified levels of attainment for GCSE Qualifications.</p>

<p>We set out below our general requirements for the purposes of Condition GCSE9.1(b). We will publish additional specific requirements from time to time, including in relation to the setting of particular specified levels of attainment.</p>

<p>For ease of reference, the specified levels of attainment used in GCSE Qualifications are referred to below as ‘grades’.</p>

<p>These requirements apply to assessments for GCSE Qualifications that are graded using the 9 to 1 or 9-9 to 1-1 scales.</p>

<h4>Setting key grade boundaries for all GCSE Qualifications</h4>

<p>For non-double award GCSE qualifications, the four key grade boundaries are:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) 1/U</li>
  <li>(b) 4/3</li>
  <li>(c) 7/6</li>
  <li>(d) 9/8</li>
</ol>

<p>For double award GCSE qualifications, the four key grade boundaries are:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) 1-1/U</li>
  <li>(b) 4-4/4-3</li>
  <li>(c) 7-7/7-6</li>
  <li>(d) 9-9/9-8</li>
</ol>

<p>An awarding organisation must set these key grade boundaries for each Component where they apply. In doing this, the awarding organisation must have regard to achieving suitable qualification level outcomes.</p>

<p>An awarding organisation must set key grade boundaries for each GCSE Qualification as a whole using the following method:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) The boundary mark for each Component is scaled as necessary to reflect the intended weighting of that Component as detailed in the specification.</li>
  <li>(b) The resulting scaled Component boundary marks are added and the result is rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 is rounded up).</li>
</ol>

<p>In setting the key grade boundaries an awarding organisation must:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) in the first year in which a GCSE Qualification is awarded , comply with any specific requirements that Ofqual may set ,</li>
  <li>(b) in compliance with Condition H3.1, in the second and subsequent years of awarding, set each key grade boundary so as to ensure consistency with the standard set for the same grade boundary in the first year in which the qualification is awarded, and</li>
  <li>(c) without prejudice to the requirements in the preceding paragraphs (a) and (b), have regard to achieving suitable qualification level outcomes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Setting remaining grade boundaries for non-double award GCSE Qualifications</h4>

<p>After setting the key grade boundaries as outlined above, an awarding organisation must set the 8/7, 6/5, 5/4, 3/2 and 2/1 qualification grade boundaries as follows. Where there is a remainder of one or more marks, one extra mark is added in turn to successive grade intervals, starting with the highest grade interval:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) The 8/7 boundary must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 9/8 and 7/6 boundaries by two.</li>
  <li>(b) For non-tiered qualifications and at higher tier in tiered qualifications, the 6/5 and 5/4 boundaries must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 7/6 and 4/3 boundaries by three.</li>
  <li>(c) The 3/2 and 2/1 boundaries must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 4/3 and 1/U boundaries by three.</li>
  <li>(d) At foundation tier in tiered qualifications, the 5/4 boundary is provisionally set at the same number of marks above the 4/3 boundary as the 4/3 boundary is above the 3/2 boundary. The 5/4 boundary is adjusted as necessary using statistical and technical evidence to align with the standard of grade 5 at the higher tier.</li>
  <li>(e) In a tiered GCSE qualification, the 3/U boundary on the higher tier is provisionally set by subtracting half the mark interval between the 5/4 and 4/3 boundaries (rounding up half marks) from the 4/3 boundary. Where a review of statistical and technical evidence leads the awarding organisation to judge that the 3/U boundary should be set at a different mark, consideration must be given to moving the grade 3/U boundary, and the reasons for this must be recorded.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Setting remaining grade boundaries for double award GCSE qualifications</h4>

<p>After setting the key grade boundaries as outlined above, an awarding organisation must set the remaining qualification grade boundaries as follows. Where there is a remainder of one or more marks, one extra mark is added in turn to successive grade intervals, starting with the highest grade interval:</p>

<ol class="legislative-list">
  <li>(a) The 9-8/8-8, 8-8/8-7 and 8-7/7-7 grade boundaries must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 9-9/9-8 and 7-7/7-6 boundaries by four.</li>
  <li>(b) For non-tiered qualifications and at higher tier in tiered qualifications, the 7-6/6-6, 6-6/6-5, 6-5/5-5, 5-5/5-4 and 5-4/4-4 grade boundaries must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 7-7/7-6 and 4-4/4-3 boundaries by six.</li>
  <li>(c) The 4-3/3-3, 3-3/3-2, 3-2/2-2, 2-2/2-1 and 2-1/1-1 grade boundaries must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 4-4/4-3 and 1-1/U boundaries by six.</li>
  <li>(d) At foundation tier in tiered qualifications, the 5-5/5-4 boundary is provisionally set at the same number of marks above the 4-4/4-3 boundary as the 4-4/4-3 boundary is above the 3-3/3-2 boundary. The 5-5/5-4 boundary is adjusted as necessary using statistical and technical evidence to align with the standard of grade 5-5 at the higher tier. The 5-4/4-4 boundary must be set by dividing the mark interval between the 5-5/5-4 and 4-4/4-3 boundaries by two.</li>
  <li>(e) In a tiered GCSE double award qualification, the 4-3/U boundary on the higher tier is provisionally set by subtracting half the mark interval between the 5-4/4-4 and 4-4/4-3 boundaries (rounding up half marks) from the 4-4/4-3 boundary.  Where a review of statistical and technical evidence leads the awarding organisation to judge that the 4-3/U boundary should be set at a different mark, consideration must be given to moving the grade 4-3/U boundary, and the reasons for this must be recorded.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Carrying forward non-examination Component marks</h4>

<p>So long as the requirements in Condition E10.1 are met, an awarding organisation may permit a Learner to carry forward his or her mark/moderated mark (scaled as appropriate) for an assessment which is not an Assessment by Examination from a previous attempt at the same GCSE Qualification awarded by the awarding organisation. </p>

<h2>Requirements for key dates</h2>

<h3>Reviews of marking, moderation, and appeals: requirements for key dates for GCSE Qualifications</h3>

<p>We set out below the requirements which an awarding organisation must comply with when it specifies deadlines for requesting reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. These requirements are published under Conditions GCSE14.3(b), GCSE17.3(b) and GCSE18.4(b) and apply to all GCSE Qualifications (graded from 9 to 1).</p>

<p>Awarding organisations are no longer required to set deadline dates for Learners/Centres to request reviews of marking, reviews of Moderation and appeals. In choosing to set any deadlines, an awarding organisation must comply with the requirements set out below and with all other requirements in its Conditions of Recognition.</p>

<p>In particular, the requirements set out below must be read and complied with in conjunction with the GCSE Qualification Level Conditions (which set out further requirements in relation to an awarding organisation’s arrangements).</p>

<p>The requirements set out below align with the GCSE Qualification Level Conditions which are in effect. Some relevant GCSE Qualification Level Conditions have not yet come into effect and there are currently some transitional provisions in effect. We will keep the requirements set out below under review as any changes are made.</p>

<h4>Requirements for key dates for assessments other than assessments which are marked by a Centre</h4>

<p>An awarding organisation must ensure that the requirements in the table below are met in each case where the assessment is not marked by a Centre. The table sets out the minimum timeframe within which the awarding organisation must allow a review/appeal to be requested. Provided a review/appeal is allowed to be requested in that timeframe, an awarding organisation is permitted to also provide an ‘accelerated service’ (for example, where requests for reviews provided by an earlier date will be processed more quickly).</p>
