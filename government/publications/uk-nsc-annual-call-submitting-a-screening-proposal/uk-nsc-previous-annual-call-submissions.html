<h2>
<span class="number">2020 annual </span> call topic proposals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received 4 proposals in 2020:</p>

<h3>Biliary atresia</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: include proposed methodology in next review of topic</p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received a proposal to introduce screening for biliary atresia using stool colour cards. These are cards that explain the colour of stools, ranging from those that are healthy to those that may require further investigation. Biliary atresia was already on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> list, so was not a new topic.</p>

<p>However, as work was being commissioned to look at biliary atresia in the regular <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> review cycle, it was agreed that additional questions on the use of stool coloured cards could be added to the commissioning document.</p>

<h3>Klinefelter syndrome</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The 2020 submission on screening for Klinefelter syndrome sought the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s input as to whether more work should be commissioned following the previous annual call proposal in 2018.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> decided a further review was not justified.</p>

<h3>Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (<abbr title="Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2">CLN2</abbr>)</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>This was a new topic which the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> had not reviewed before.</p>

<p>An evidence map was commissioned to look at 3 important questions covering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>test accuracy</li>
  <li>treatment</li>
  <li>whether there are any national or international guidelines on population screening</li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence map concluded that the volume and type of evidence relating to screening for <abbr title="Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2">CLN2</abbr> did not justify an evidence summary at this stage and no further work on screening for <abbr title="Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2">CLN2</abbr> should be commissioned. This was because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there were no international recommendations on population screening to detect <abbr title="Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2">CLN2</abbr> in newborns</li>
  <li>there was no direct evidence on how good screening tests were in a setting comparable to a population screening</li>
  <li>there were no studies on the benefits of treatment in screen-detected patients, and very limited evidence on the effectiveness of treatment in pre-symptomatic patients</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pressure reducing carotid stenosis in adults over 50</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>It was noted that the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> had looked at this topic following a 2019 annual call for topic submission and an evidence map had been commissioned. The recommendation of the 2019 evidence map was that further work should not be commissioned. Given the recent work undertaken on this topic and that no new evidence was submitted with the new proposal, it was agreed that no further work should be commissioned at this time.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2019 annual </span> call topic proposals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received 5 proposals in 2019:</p>

<h3>Dyslexia in school-age children</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>This proposal suggested that children of school age should be screened for dyslexia.</p>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that it fell within the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit and had not been considered before.</p>

<p>It was decided that an evidence map should be commissioned.</p>

<p>This evidence map concluded that the volume and type of studies available about the accuracy of screening tests specifically for dyslexia is insufficient to justify a further review of the evidence.</p>

<h3>Fetal presentation in pregnancy (to check on the baby’s position at 36 weeks)</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>The proposal is to screen all pregnant women for fetal presentation using a handheld ultrasound device during routine antenatal appointments at around 36 weeks of gestation.</p>

<p>The aim would be to detect the position of the baby to see if the baby is head-down (cephalic) rather than bottom or feet first (breech position) or lying sideways (transverse position). Screening would aim to detect those babies who were not head-down and to offer options to help manipulate the baby’s position to become head-down or offer a planned caesarean delivery to minimise harm to mother and baby.</p>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this proposal had not been considered before and fell within a defined whole population group. It was agreed that an evidence map would be commissioned to scope the volume and type of published peer reviewed evidence available on this condition. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> agreed to this approach.</p>

<p>The evidence map recommended that the topic should be added to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> recommendations list, so that it can be reconsidered in 3 years’ time or sooner if significant evidence should be published before this time.</p>

<h3>Liver cirrhosis in high risk groups</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The proposal calls to screen high risk groups of the condition using transient elastography. Liver cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by long-term liver damage which then prevents the liver from working properly. This can lead to liver failure. There is no cure for cirrhosis but it is possible to manage symptoms through lifestyle changes.</p>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this proposal fell outside the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit at the time because it related to high risk groups. It was proposed that no further work should be conducted. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> agreed.</p>

<h3>Pressure reducing carotid stenosis in adults over 50</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>It was noted that the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> had looked at this topic following a 2019 annual call for topic submission and an evidence map had been commissioned. The recommendation of the 2019 evidence map was that further work should not be commissioned. Given the recent work undertaken on this topic and that no new evidence was submitted with the new proposal, it was agreed that no further work should be commissioned at this time.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5q </span> spinal muscular atrophy (<abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>) in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission considered as early topic update</p>
</div>

<p>The proposal called for newborn screening for 5q <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that the proposal did not meet the inclusion criteria for the annual call for new topics, as <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> screening in newborns is included in the list of conditions that the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> regularly reviews. However, it was agreed to consider this submission as an early topic update given that new evidence submitted by the stakeholder may impact the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s 2018 recommendation not to offer antenatal or newborn screening for <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team assessed if the new evidence would have an impact on the conclusions of the 2018 <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence review and presented its conclusion to this meeting.</p>

<p>The proposal drew attention to developments relating to treatment. The evidence presented by the NURTURE study showed promising results in relation to the efficacy of the drug nusinersen in asymptomatic individuals with <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> type I to II. It is important to note that these are preliminary results and the study is due to report its conclusion in 2025.</p>

<p>The recent change in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) guidance on the use of nusinersen as a treatment option in 5q <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> in individuals with pre-symptomatic <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>, or <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> types 1, 2 or 3 is also a significant development and focuses attention on screening. However, the information provided in the proposal did not include new evidence in relation to other criteria that were not met in the 2018 review, such as the screening test.</p>

<p>There were also concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. An estimate is difficult because of lack of evidence about long-term benefits and the possibility of regression. Therefore, an early update would be unlikely to change the conclusion of the review overall.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> organised a workshop with a wide range of stakeholders to plan the next steps to review the case for screening for <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr>. A proposal for a scoping exercise to inform a decision analytic model and cost effectiveness evaluation of newborn screening for <abbr title="spinal muscular atrophy">SMA</abbr> was drafted following the stakeholder workshop. This work is in the process of being commissioned.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2018 annual </span> call topic proposals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received 10 proposals:</p>

<h3>All cancers in 30 to 75-year-olds</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this did not meet the criteria for formal consideration due to lack of evidence on outcomes.</p>

<h3>Cutaneous melanoma in adults</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>Following a submission to the 2018 annual call, an evidence map was commissioned to find out if there was any evidence available on the accuracy of using ocular/iris photography to detect iris nevi/iris pigmented lesions to screen for risk of cutaneous melanoma.</p>

<p>No studies examining the accuracy of this test were found and the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> recommended that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no further work should be carried out due to lack of evidence</li>
  <li>cutaneous melanoma in adults should not be added to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s list of topics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (<abbr title="neurofibromatosis type 1">NF1</abbr>) in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>An evidence map for <abbr title="neurofibromatosis type 1">NF1</abbr> was commissioned following the 2018 annual call. It addressed 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are there any guidelines and/or recommendations for systematic population screening?</li>
  <li>Is there evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of physical examination of the child’s skin as a screening test?</li>
  <li>Is there any evidence of the benefits of early detection of <abbr title="neurofibromatosis type 1">NF1</abbr>?</li>
</ol>

<p>No guidelines or recommendations were found. There was some evidence on the test but none of this evidence assessed the diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p>No studies were found that directly assessed the benefits of early detection. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> agreed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there was not enough evidence to progress to the next step of the process and commission a more detailed assessment</li>
  <li>the condition should not be added to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s list of topics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Klinefelter syndrome</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>An evidence map was commissioned to scope the volume and direction of the evidence for this condition since it had not been previously considered. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> considered the evidence map, which looked at 3 important questions, at its meeting in November 2019.</p>

<p>The evidence map only found 5 potential references which related to the incidence and prevalence of the condition. It found no evidence on the 2 other questions, which looked at any type of potential screening test in newborns, children or adolescents. There were no national or international guidelines or recommendations on screening for Klinefelter syndrome.</p>

<p>As the evidence base was limited, the committee agreed that it did not meet the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s criteria for a population screening programme and further work should not be commissioned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22q11 </span> deletion syndrome in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>22q11 deletion syndrome (also called DiGeorge syndrome) is a condition present from birth that can cause a range of lifelong problems, including heart defects and learning difficulties. The evaluation group agreed that the evidence team would do more work to check references to understand the volume of literature available.</p>

<p>The following questions were addressed in the evidence map:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the incidence/prevalence and severity of 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome in the UK?</li>
  <li>Is there a simple, safe, precise and validated screening test for 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome?</li>
  <li>Are there any national or international guidelines or recommendations on population screening for 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome?</li>
</ol>

<p>Six references were included in the final evidence map: one on prevalence in the UK and 5 on the diagnostic accuracy of potential screening tests. No guidance or recommendations on population screening for 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome were found.</p>

<p>One study conducted in the UK was identified which reported prevalence. However, this study was conducted in 1994 to 1995 and was not carried out in a high-risk population so it would not be comparable to the general population.</p>

<p>Five studies on diagnostic accuracy studies were found. However, these considered a range of different tests and were all small case-control studies, which restricted their usefulness in determining the accuracy of the test in a screening population.</p>

<p>It was concluded that the volume and type of evidence related to screening for 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome was insufficient to justify an evidence summary.</p>

<h3>Beta thalassaemia in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission an evidence summary</p>
</div>

<p>This was a proposal for beta thalassaemia major to be formally screened for rather than be reported as an incidental finding within the existing newborn screening programme for sickle cell disease. The evaluation group agreed to consider this proposal as a major programme modification.</p>

<p>An evidence summary was commissioned. It recommended further areas of research to consider before newborn screening for beta thalassaemia major might be included in the NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme. For example, cost-effectiveness of formally screening for beta thalassaemia major was flagged as an area that would benefit from further research.</p>

<h3>Lung cancer in adults</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>This condition is already on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s list of conditions which is reviewed regularly as per its published process. No further action is required.</p>

<h3>Risk of sudden cardiac death</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>This condition is already on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s list of conditions which is reviewed regularly as per its published process. No further action is required.</p>

<h3>Nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases (<abbr title="nonsyndromic thoracic aortic diseases">NS-TAD</abbr>)</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that no further action was needed because the proposal related to cascade testing, not population screening. Cascade testing is the systematic tracing and testing of family members of an affected patient for a genetic disease. The ‘index case’ is the first person in a family to be identified with the condition. Family members of the index patient are tested to find out if they also have the condition.</p>

<h3>Carbon monoxide levels</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence summary</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this proposal was within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> and that an evidence summary to look at screening for carbon monoxide levels in pregnancy should be commissioned. Based on the evidence summary, it was not possible to conclude whether screening would increase smoking cessation rates in pregnancy. It was agreed that further work on this topic should not be commissioned as it was unlikely to identify the evidence required to recommend a population screening programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2017 annual </span> call topic proposals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received 4 proposals:</p>

<h3>Keratoconus in children and young adults with Down’s syndrome</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this proposal falls outside the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit of whole population screening programmes. Therefore the proposal was sent to the Down Syndrome Medical Interest Group and <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> to consider.</p>

<h3>Increased risk of stroke in children with sickle cell disease</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that the proposal to diagnose children with sickle cell disease (<abbr title="sickle cell disease">SCD</abbr>) who are at a higher risk of stroke and to offer early intervention was outside the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> but was part of the care pathway for children diagnosed with <abbr title="sickle cell disease">SCD</abbr>. Although no further action was required by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> it was agreed that the issue would be escalated to NHS England and <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence summary</p>
</div>

<p>ANSD represents a range of possible disorders and prognoses due to a problem with the hearing nerve and is defined by a pattern of test results.</p>

<p>The evaluation group agreed to review the proposal for ANSD to be added to the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening  Programme (NHSP) as a programme modification.</p>

<p>The evidence summary concluded that ANSD should not be added to the NHSP. This was because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there was uncertainty as to the number of babies with the condition who are missed using the current screening strategy and who would benefit from the addition of ANSD to the programme</li>
  <li>only one small study looked at the test in the newborn general population and conclusions on the accuracy of the test could not be made</li>
  <li>there was no published information on the practicalities of implementing the test in the newborn general population</li>
</ul>

<h3>Endometrial cancer</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission scoping exercise</p>
</div>

<p>This submission was handled as a new topic as the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> had not looked at the evidence to screen for endometrial cancer before. A scoping exercise was undertaken which revealed that screening is not recommended. It was therefore agreed that this would not to be added to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> list of conditions to screen for.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2016 annual </span> call topic proposals</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> received 4 proposals:</p>

<h3>Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (<abbr title="cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy">cCALD</abbr>) in newborns</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: commission evidence map</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group agreed that this proposal was within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> and that an evidence map on screening in newborns should be commissioned. The evidence map identified a number of issues. These included:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The screening test was still experimental. Case control type studies are the mainstay of accuracy estimates and its use in a population setting is currently being evaluated in the New York State newborn screening programme.</li>
  <li>The test would identify a number of boys with the genetic mutation who would not develop&nbsp;<abbr title="cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy">cCALD</abbr>. In addition, the test would identify babies with conditions, other than&nbsp;<abbr title="adrenoleukodystrophy">ALD</abbr>, for which there are no interventions.</li>
  <li>There was uncertainty on the ability of the diagnostic pathway to distinguish those requiring haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<abbr title="haematopoietic stem cell transplantation">HSCT</abbr>)&nbsp;from those who do not.</li>
  <li>There was uncertainty on the balance of long-term benefits and harms of treatment with&nbsp;<abbr title="haematopoietic stem cell transplantation">HSCT</abbr>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although&nbsp;further work was not justified, the&nbsp;<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>&nbsp;agreed to add adrenoleukodystrophy to the list of conditions to be reviewed as part of its regular update cycle.</p>

<h3>Hypercholesterolaemia in children</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: early topic update not justified</p>
</div>

<p>The evaluation group felt this submission was more in keeping with an early update proposal because familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is already on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s list of conditions that it regularly reviews.</p>

<p>The submission was prompted by the publication of a study of screening in children aged 2.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> commissioned 2 external assessments to summarise the evidence submitted and consider the impact on the previous review of the topic.&nbsp; These assessments, and their recommendations on whether to bring the FH review forward, were considered by the chair and vice-chair of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>, the Fetal, Maternal and Child Health (FMCH) reference group and the Director of Screening. They agreed with the overall recommendation of these assessments that an early update was not justified.</p>

<p>The main reasons an early update was not justified were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an absence of information on the management of children with FH identified by screening</li>
  <li>that the acceptability of the strategy was only evaluated in those with positive results</li>
  <li>clinical and cost effectiveness compared with current practice was not addressed</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, the study did not alter the overall recommendation of the previous review.</p>

<p>Although the review of screening for FH in children aged between 1 and 2 was not brought forward, the evidence submitted was subsequently included in the 2019 evidence summary.</p>

<h3>Prostate cancer</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>Prostate cancer is already on the list of topics and was reviewed in 2016. The proposal is to add MRI as a risk refinement test following the identification of eligible men using a risk calculator. The risk calculator is based on the outcomes of the STHLM3 study. This study was considered in the last <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> review.</p>

<p>It is proposed further consideration of this approach should be deferred until the next review of prostate cancer screening. The proposed strategy should be considered in the scoping work at the beginning of the review project.</p>

<h3>Anal cancer</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>UK NSC decision: submission declined</p>
</div>

<p>Anal cancer is already on the list of topics and is due for review in 2017 to 2018. A document is being prepared on whether the topic should be retained on the list. This is because the condition is confined to high risk groups and may not be within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>It is proposed that this topic should not be taken any further as it falls outside the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit.</p>
