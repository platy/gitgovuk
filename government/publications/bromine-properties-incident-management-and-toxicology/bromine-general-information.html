<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Bromine is a naturally occurring element that forms a dark reddish-brown liquid at room temperature. It has a strong suffocating odour and dissolves in water to form bromic acid.</p>

<h3>Uses of bromine</h3>

<p>Bromine is widely used as water sanitiser for pools and spas. Its use is often preferred in spas as it does not give off the same characteristic odour as chlorine. It is also used in the production of fire retardants, dyestuffs, photography, pharmaceuticals and for bleaching fibres and silk.</p>

<h3>How bromine gets into the environment</h3>

<p>Bromine occurs naturally in the earth’s crust and is also present in seawater. It may also be released into the environment during its production, use or transport.</p>

<h2>Exposure to bromine</h2>

<p>The general public may be exposed to small amounts of bromine due to its use in some products such as pool sanitisers. Low-level exposure from the correct use of these products would not be expected to cause adverse health effects.</p>

<p>Workers producing bromine products or using bromine are more likely to be exposed, although safe levels of exposure are enforced to protect workers. Such levels are below those that are thought to cause harmful effects.</p>

<h2>How exposure to bromine can affect your health</h2>

<p>The presence of bromine in the environment does not always lead to exposure. In order for bromine to cause any adverse health effects, you must come into contact with it. You may be exposed by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance or by skin contact. Following exposure to any chemical, the adverse health effects that you may encounter depend on several factors, including the amount to which you are exposed (dose), the way you are exposed, the duration of exposure, the form of the chemical and if you were exposed to any other chemicals.</p>

<p>Low-level exposure from the correct use of products that contain bromine would not be expected to cause adverse health effects.</p>

<p>Ingestion of bromine can cause immediate pain with burning in the mouth, throat and stomach followed by abdominal pain, vomiting and difficulty breathing. The lips and tongue may appear stained with a brown colour.</p>

<p>Breathing in bromine vapours can cause irritation of the eyes and nose, sore throat, cough, chest tightness and wheeze. Headache, fever, rapid heart rate and breathlessness can also occur. In severe cases there may be corrosive damage to the airways.</p>

<p>Skin exposure to a dilute solution of bromine can cause an itchy, blotchy type rash on the skin which may last for up to 2 weeks. Exposure to higher concentrations of bromine liquid or fumes can cause burns which take a long time to heal. Liquid spilt on the skin causes a cooling sensation on first contact followed by a burning sensation. The burns initially appear as brown discolouration of the skin followed by blisters on the skin. In some cases, the burns may cause no pain or visible effects and can develop 1 to 5 days after exposure.</p>

<p>Eye exposure to low concentrations of bromine liquid or vapour can cause eyelid swelling, tearing, irritation and redness of the eye. Higher concentrations can cause severe burns with swelling of the eye, twitching and sensitivity to light.</p>

<p>Repeated exposure to bromine over a long period of time can cause effects on the nervous system, digestive system and the skin. Effects include changes in mood, hallucinations, loss of appetite, constipation, a yellowing of the skin, spots, blisters and facial swelling.</p>

<h3>Bromine and cancer</h3>

<p>Exposure to bromine has not been linked to the development of cancer.</p>

<h3>Vulnerable people</h3>

<p>People with breathing problems such as asthma may be more sensitive to the effects of bromine. This is because bromine can cause irritation of the airways leading to chest tightness, wheezing and breathlessness.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy and the unborn child</h3>

<p>There is limited data available on the effects of exposure to bromine on pregnancy and the unborn child. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions. Effects on the unborn child are more likely to occur if the exposure to bromine causes the mother to become unwell.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Children would be expected to have similar effects to those seen in adults. They are not expected to be more sensitive to the effects of bromine.</p>

<p>Bromine containing products stored at home should be kept in an appropriate container and kept out of the reach of children.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are exposed to bromine</h2>

<p>Low-level exposure from the correct use of products that contain bromine would not be expected to cause adverse health effects.</p>

<p>For all other exposures to bromine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should remove yourself from the source of exposure</li>
  <li>if you have got bromine on your skin, remove soiled clothing (not over the head), wash the affected area with lukewarm water and soap for at least 10 to 15 minutes and seek medical advice</li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have got bromine in your eyes, remove contact lenses, irrigate the affected eye with lukewarm water for at least 10 to 15 minutes and seek medical advice</p>
  </li>
  <li>if you have inhaled or ingested bromine, seek medical advice</li>
</ul>
