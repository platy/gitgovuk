<p>This Appendix contains the specific completion rules instructions for the 9-series Additional Procedure Codes for Data Element 1/11 for Final Supplementary Declarations (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>).</p>

<p>Use the index list below and the Additional Procedure Codes completion notes to help you identify the correct code to use and for guidance on how to complete the declaration.</p>

<p>This Appendix includes Additional Procedure Codes:</p>

<p>97F: Final Supplementary Declaration (<abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr>) 2</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-code-for-final-supplementary-declarations">CDS Declaration Completion Instructions for Final Supplementary Declarations</a>. This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for the 3-digit Additional Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the <abbr title="Final Supplementary Declaration">FSD</abbr> should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in DE 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in DE 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are a supplement to the DE 1/10 Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the requested or previous procedure included against the relevant DE 1/10 Procedure Code (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appendix-1-de-110-requested-and-previous-procedure-code-for-final-supplementary-declarations">Appendix 1: DE 1/10: Requested and Previous Procedure Codes</a>) must also be followed.</p>

<p>The DE 1/10 completion notes, including conditions and restrictions, are not repeated within or superseded by the DE 1/11 completion notes.</p>
