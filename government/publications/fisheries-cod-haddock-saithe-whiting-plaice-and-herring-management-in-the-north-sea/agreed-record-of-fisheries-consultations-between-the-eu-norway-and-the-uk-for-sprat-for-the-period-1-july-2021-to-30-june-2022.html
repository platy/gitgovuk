<p>A European Union Delegation, headed by Mr Fabrizio DONATELLA, a Norwegian Delegation. headed by Ms Ann Kristin WESTBERG, and a United Kingdom Delegation, headed by Mr Colin FAULKNER, met virtually in the period 14 - 18 June 2021 to consult on mutual fisheries relations for sprat in <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> Division 3a and Subareas 4 and Division 2a for 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>The Delegations noted that, since 2019, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (<abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr>) advice for sprat encompasses both the North Sea and Skagerrak/Kattegat and considers this a single stock. The parties agreed that as a consequence, the stock should now be reviewed through the trilateral consultations between the European Union, Norway and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Norwegian and the European Union Delegations noted that, in 2020, they agreed on a method to distribute the <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> single stock advice, which resulted in an allocation of 18.3% of the overall advice as the basis for setting the <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> for the Skagerrak/Kattegat.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom delegation noted that it had not, in its own right, been party to that 2020 decision on allocation. It further noted that the 2018 <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> bench-marking exercise for the stock had proposed a variety of metrics which could guide the decision on allocating the <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> between the 2 areas in addition to the use of historic TACs. It urged the parties to adopt an allocation method which more accurately reflects the spatial distribution of the resource.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Delegation agreed with the UK delegation that, as a principle, allocation methods should reflect the spatial distribution of fish stocks.</p>

<p>The Delegations agreed to recommend to their respective authorities the following fishery arrangements for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, as outlined in this Agreed Record.</p>

<p>The Delegations noted that <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> released the advice on sprat in Division 3a and Subarea 4 (Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea) on 13 April 2021. Based on its Maximum Sustainable Yield (<abbr title="Maximum Sustainable Yield">MSY</abbr>) approach, <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> advises that catches in the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea for the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022 should be no more than 106,715 tonnes.</p>

<p>The Delegations agreed to apply a split of the <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> between North Sea and Skagerrak which would allocate 18.3% of the <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> to the Skagerrak in the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>The Delegations consequently agreed to establish a <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> for sprat in <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> Division 3.a (Skagerrak and Kattegat) of 19,529 tonnes and for <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> Subarea 4 of 87,186 tonnes for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This is a decrease of 49% compared to the previous <abbr title="Total allowable catches">TAC</abbr> period.</p>

<p>The Delegations agreed to work in order to increase the quality of the scientific advice for sprat in <abbr title="International Council for the Exploration of the Sea">ICES</abbr> Division 3a and Subarea 4, both in the short and longer term. For the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, should surveys undertaken later in 2021 indicate that there may be a significant change in the stock abundance. Delegations will consult further ahead of the 2022 to 2023 annual consultations.</p>

<p>By correspondence. 18 June 2021</p>

<p>For the European Union Delegation, Fabrizio DONA TELLA</p>

<p>For the Norwegian Delegation, Ann Kristin WESTBERG</p>

<p>For the United Kingdom delegation, Colin FAULKNER</p>
