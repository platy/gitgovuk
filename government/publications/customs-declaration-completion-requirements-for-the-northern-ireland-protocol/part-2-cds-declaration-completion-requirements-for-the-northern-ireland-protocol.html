<h4>Declaration completion requirements</h4>

<h5>Data Element 5/23 – Location of goods</h5>

<p>The <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> mode of transport should only be used for a <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> movement at a valid location.
Each Goods Location is classified as either: ‘Ro-Ro only’; ‘Mixed’ (ie, both Ro-Ro and non-Ro-Ro traffic), or; ‘non-Ro-Ro only’. Locations that are <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> only or <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> mixed are shown below.</p>

<h5>Data Element 7/4 – Mode of Transport at the border</h5>

<p>Mode of transport ‘6’ is intended for use when goods are sent to/from the UK via what is traditionally understood to be, a ‘Roll-on, Roll-off’ ferry movement, via specific locations designated as ‘<abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> Ports’.</p>

<h5>General Notes</h5>

<p>Where a declaration is made to the Customs Declaration Service (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) for a <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr> movement via a route operating the pre-lodgement model this should be pre-lodged before the goods reach the port/location of departure.</p>

<h4>Summary of MoT changes</h4>
<p>Current values and meanings of the mode of transport codes are as documented in the current version of Volume 3 of the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Tariff and should now include Mode 6 as below:</p>

<p>1 – Seaport</p>

<p>2 – Rail transport</p>

<p>3 – Road transport</p>

<p>4 – Air transport</p>

<p>5 – Postal consignment</p>

<p>6 – <abbr title="Roll on Roll off modes of transport">RoRo</abbr></p>

<p>7 – Fixed Transport installations</p>

<p>8 – Inland waterway transport</p>

<p>9 – Own propulsion</p>

<h3>Goods Vehicle Movement Service (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr>): Description of the service</h3>

<p>The UK will operate a service called Goods Vehicle Movement Service (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr>) for which movements of goods, at locations and on routes that have chosen to adopt the pre-lodgement model, will be registered and recorded at import and export.</p>

<p><abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr> will operate for Transit movements and movements between GB and Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A unique reference number (a Goods Movement Record (<abbr title="Goods Movement Record">GMR</abbr>)) for each goods vehicle movement through the border will be created and issued by <abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>‘At risk’ and ‘not at risk’ goods</h2>

<p>The Northern Ireland Protocol (<abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NIP</abbr>) maintains regulatory standards on the island of Ireland, that means licensing requirements, restricted and prohibited goods etc remain as they are today.</p>

<p>For the purposes of customs duty requirements all goods will be declared ‘at risk’ or not ‘at risk’ of entering the EU market.</p>

<p>For imports from GB, EU customs duty will be applied to ‘at risk’ goods and no customs duty will apply if the goods are not ‘at risk’.</p>

<p>For imports from the Rest of the World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>), EU customs duty will be applied to ‘at risk’ goods and UK customs duty will apply if the goods are not ‘at risk’.</p>

<p>Traders will be able to declare their goods are not ‘at risk’ using <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statements.  The Co-Chairs of the Joint Committee have reached an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/946278/Decision_of_the_Withdrawal_Agreement_Joint_Committee_on_the_determination_of_goods_not_at_risk.pdf" rel="external">agreement in principle</a> on the determination of goods not ‘at risk’. Further guidance on this will be published shortly.</p>

<h3>Accessing the EU Tariff for EU duty rates and measures on At-risk goods</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en" rel="external">EU Tariff (Volume 2)</a> is available online.</p>

<h3>EU/ UK Free Trade Agreement</h3>

<p>For goods being declared under the EU-UK Free Trade Agreement, in order to make a claim to EU preference rates against goods from Great Britain where the goods are ‘at risk’, the customs declaration should be completed as follows:</p>

<p>*Please note - VAT tax type B05 covers the VAT due on the EU customs duties (VAT on A50, A80, etc).  ‘At risk’ items will have both B00 (VAT on the goods item) and B05 (VAT on the EU/<abbr title="Northern Ireland Protocol">NIP</abbr> duties) calculated and returned to the trader. Both tax types must therefore be declared for ‘At-Risk’ goods.</p>

<p>If the goods are not considered to be ‘At Risk’ and the UK (Global) Tariff is applicable the current tax type codes should be used – see table below</p>

<h2>Claiming customs duty waivers (subsidies)</h2>

<p>Customs duty waivers (subsidies) can be claimed via a customs declaration when EU duty rates are charged against ‘at-risk’ goods for GB-<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> and ROW-<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> movements. Please note that customs duty waivers cannot currently be claimed post-clearance.</p>

<p>Traders will be able to use the <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement ‘NIAID’ in Data Element 2/2 – Additional Information when they wish to and are eligible to claim a customs duty waiver.</p>

<h3>Terms and Conditions for customs duty waivers</h3>

<p>Subject to the exceptions below, the customs duty waiver will be de minimis aid claimed in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to de minimis aid (OJ L 352, 24.12.2013 p 1-8).
The maximum amount of aid which can be claimed under this Regulation is a total of €200,000 over three fiscal years (or €100,000 over three fiscal years for undertakings performing road freight transport for hire or reward).</p>

<p>There are separate allowances for the primary agriculture sector and the fishery and aquaculture sector, but it is not currently possible for traders operating in one or both of these sectors to claim a customs duty waiver.</p>

<p>When an undertaking is active in multiple sectors with differing de minimis allowances, the lowest allowance will apply to all activities of the undertaking.</p>

<p>The period of three tax years is assessed on a rolling basis so that, for each new grant of de minimis aid, the total amount of de minimis aid granted in the tax year concerned and during the previous two tax years needs to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Use of the NIAID <abbr title="Additional Information">AI</abbr> statement constitutes a declaration that the undertaking has checked that it will not surpass the appropriate de minimis aid allowance by claiming a waiver on this occasion. This allowance includes any de minimis aid received from any source in a three-year tax period. Any de minimis aid provided under this scheme will be relevant if the undertaking wishes to apply, or has applied, for any other de minimis aid. Undertakings will need to declare the duty waived to any aid-awarding body which requests information on how much de minimis aid has been received and maintain appropriate records to enable this to be done.</p>

<p>The de minimis allowance applies to an entire business, referred to as a ‘single undertaking’. This includes any enterprises linked to a business which have at least one of the following relationships with each other:</p>

<p>(a) one enterprise has a majority of the shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in another enterprise;
(b) one enterprise has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of another enterprise;
(c) one enterprise has the right to exercise a dominant influence over another enterprise pursuant to a contract entered into with that enterprise or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association;
(d) one enterprise, which is a shareholder in or member of another enterprise, controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that enterprise, a majority of shareholders’ or members’ voting rights in that enterprise.</p>

<p>Undertakings having any of the relationships referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph through one or more other enterprises shall be considered to be a single undertaking, and the relevant de minimis allowance shall apply to all enterprises in the relationship.</p>

<p>In the case of mergers or acquisitions, all prior de minimis aid granted to any of the merging undertakings shall be taken into account in determining whether any new de minimis aid to the new or the acquiring undertaking exceeds the relevant allowance. De minimis aid lawfully granted before the merger or acquisition shall remain lawful. If one undertaking splits into two or more separate undertakings, de minimis aid granted prior to the split shall be allocated to the undertaking that benefited from it, which is in principle the undertaking taking over the activities for which the de minimis aid was used. If such an allocation is not possible, the de minimis aid shall be allocated proportionately on the basis of the book value of the equity capital of the new undertakings at the effective date of the split.</p>

<h2>Postponed VAT Accounting</h2>

<p>Postponed VAT Accounting (<abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>) is the process by which VAT registered traders can account for import VAT on their VAT return, instead of making a payment, securing payment or using deferment to pay the Import VAT due on a customs declaration.  See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-account-for-import-vat-on-your-vat-return">further details on the terms and conditions</a>.</p>

<p>All UK VAT registered Importers will be eligible to use <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>; no authorisation will be required. They will simply make the appropriate entry and provide their <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> and/or VAT registration number (<abbr title="VAT registration number">VRN</abbr>) on their customs declaration.</p>

<p>This process (subject to Customs clearance) will allow the goods to enter into free circulation without up-front payment of the import VAT. The customs declaration will generate an online Monthly Postponed Import VAT Statement (<abbr title="Monthly Postponed Import VAT Statement">MPIVS</abbr>) that will be the evidence required to account for and recover the import VAT as input tax (where eligible to recover as input tax) on their next VAT return.</p>

<p>(Note: The C79 will continue to be produced for those entries where any VAT was paid on importation).</p>

<h3>Goods held under Special Procedures and Excise suspension arrangements</h3>

<p>If you initially declare goods into a customs Special Procedure, you can account for import VAT on your VAT Return when you submit the declaration that releases those goods into free circulation from the following special procedures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>customs warehousing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inward processing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>temporary admission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outward processing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can account for import VAT on your VAT Return when you release imported excise goods for use in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> - also known as ‘released for home consumption’. This includes when goods are released from an excise warehouse after being in duty suspense since the point of import.</p>

<h3>General Conditions</h3>

<p><abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> can only be used by an importer who is VAT registered in the UK, or the Isle of Man. 
For VAT groups that hold multiple EORIs and have a single <abbr title="VAT registration number">VRN</abbr>, it is the responsibility of the representative member to compile an accurate VAT return for all members of the group.</p>

<p>Note that it is also the responsibility of the VAT registered trader to access their data on the digital service and identify the import VAT liability for the period in question.</p>

<p>Where the customs value of the goods cannot be confirmed at import the confirmed amount can be submitted to <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> but the security (‘disputed amount’) will still need to be secured at the point of import. Please see further guidance on gov.uk in regard to this requirement.</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

<p>Agents are not eligible for <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> even if they are acting in an indirect capacity.</p>

<p>VAT will be postponed against the importer’s <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> and will be at declaration level only.</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 is also used for declarations to Onward Supply Relief (<abbr title="Onward Supply Relief">OSR</abbr>). You should complete an <abbr title="Onward Supply Relief">OSR</abbr> declaration according to the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 completion notes. The <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> completion notes shown here are not appropriate to an <abbr title="Onward Supply Relief">OSR</abbr> declaration.</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> cannot be used where a declaration is made using the I1 B&amp;E simplified declaration on an occasional basis. The data set for this declaration does not include <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40.</p>

<h3>Changes for Customs intermediaries acting on behalf of an importer</h3>

<p>For intermediaries submitting on behalf of an importer, the <abbr title="VAT registration number">VRN</abbr> must be that of the importer. VAT cannot be postponed against the intermediary’s account on behalf of an importer. Where an agent is acting for an importer, they must ensure that they have the importer’s permission to use <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Declaration completion requirements</h4>

<h5>Data Element 2/6 – Deferred Payment</h5>

<p>Where <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> is used, the use of two deferment accounts on a declaration is no longer valid. This process would normally consist of entering a deferment account against code ‘1DAN’ to allocate any duty excise or other debts, with any VAT debt being allocated to the second deferment account entered against code ‘2DAN’. As import VAT is not paid or deferred ‘2DAN’ is not a valid code on a declaration when <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr> is used.</p>

<h5>Data Element 3/40 - Additional Fiscal References Identification Number</h5>

<p>The VAT registration number of the importer in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/16 should be entered to <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 3/40 at header level when they are eligible to use <abbr title="Postponed VAT Accounting">PVA</abbr>.</p>
