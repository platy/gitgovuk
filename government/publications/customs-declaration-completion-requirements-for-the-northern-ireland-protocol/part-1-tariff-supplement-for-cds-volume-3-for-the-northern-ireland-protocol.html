<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Requirements for movements into Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>The Union Customs Code (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Whilst the <abbr title="Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018">TCTA</abbr>, CEDEER and CIDEER apply to goods imported to or exported from GB, under the Northern Ireland Protocol, goods movements into Northern Ireland will apply the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>. <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> is the only system that can cater for full Northern Ireland Protocol compliance on 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Harmonised System 2022</h3>

<p>Commodity codes are used worldwide to classify goods that are imported and exported. They are standardised up to 6-digits and reviewed by the World Customs Organisation every 5 years. Following the end of the latest review, the UK codes will be changing on 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2022, the UK will introduce its 2022 Integrated Tariff. This will incorporate the World Customs Organisation’s changes to the Harmonised System Nomenclature (<abbr title="Harmonised System Nomenclature">HSN</abbr>). The full nomenclature is being published between now and early January, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/help/cn2021_cn2022?_ga=2.119630272.952479697.1639578814-2113230958.1619097277" rel="external">2022 UK goods classification</a> to review the correlation of commodity codes from the 2021 Tariff to that of 2022 Tariff going live on 1 January 2022.</p>

<p>The update to the <abbr title="Harmonised System Nomenclature">HSN</abbr> could impact you if you pre-lodge declarations for movements of goods after 1 January 2022. You should familiarise yourself with the new codes and measures to ensure you are selecting the right information for any pre-lodged declarations made prior to January and ensure that any system changes are made for declarations from January 2022 onwards.</p>

<h3>Rest of World to Northern Ireland movements</h3>

<p>Goods imported from the Rest of World (<abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr>) into Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) may be subject to the duty rates and measures of either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/xi/sections" rel="external">UK Tariff</a></li>
</ul>
<p>or the</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en" rel="external">EU Tariff</a></li>
</ul>

<p>depending on whether the goods are classed as ‘At-Risk’ of entering the EU.</p>

<p>This document does not consider the movement of non-freight goods, further information will be published at a later date.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>All goods moved from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> will require both an entry safety and security declaration (ENS) and an import declaration. A record of the movement will also need to be made on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-for-cds-customs-declaration-completion-requirements-for-the-northern-ireland-protocol/part-2-annexe-cds-declaration-completion-requirements?preview=4805505#goods-vehicle-movement-service-annexe" rel="external">Goods Vehicle Movement Service</a> (<abbr title="Goods Vehicle Movement Service">GVMS</abbr>), where the port is operating the pre-lodgement model.</p>

<p>No export safety and security (EXS)/export declaration is required in GB for GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> movements.</p>

<p>All goods will be subject to EU regulatory standards, which may be applied through the Tariff.  Goods will only be required to pay customs duty at the EU rate if they are classed as ‘at risk’. Goods but will not be subject to import VAT, but <a class="govuk-link" href="#excise">excise may be due</a>.</p>

<p>If the goods are UK domestic goods, either by origin or previous release to free circulation, and are not ‘At-Risk’, then they will not be subject to customs duty, any other duties or import VAT (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#excise">‘Excise’ section</a>).</p>

<p>Goods which are not UK domestic goods will be treated as <abbr title="Rest of the World">RoW</abbr> movements into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> can no longer be used to make declarations for the movement of goods into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<h4>VAT on goods sold between GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h4>

<p>VAT will continue to be accounted as it is currently on goods sold between GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>. This means that the seller of the goods will continue to charge its customers VAT and should show this on its invoices. The VAT charged will be accounted for as output VAT on the VAT return in the same box as it is now. The seller will not be able to claim this back as input VAT.</p>

<p>Where the customer receives an invoice from the seller showing that VAT has been charged, it may use this as evidence in order to reclaim the VAT as input VAT, subject to the normal rules.</p>

<p>Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accounting-for-vat-on-goods-moving-between-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021/accounting-for-vat-on-goods-moving-between-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-from-1-january-2021">Accounting for VAT on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland from 1 January 2021</a> for details of exceptions to these conditions.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> via an EU member state</h3>

<p>For goods sent from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> via this route, if Transit is not used, a GB export declaration followed by an EU import declaration will be required (the <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>/GB Tariff does not provide guidance on EU import declarations). Goods can then move freely into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> from the EU.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB</h3>

<p>Goods moved directly from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB will only require an export declaration in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> in limited circumstances.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which a declaration is required are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>indirect movements: export declarations for Irish or other EU goods below the low-value threshold of EUR3000 where the declaration has not been made to the home customs administration</li>
  <li>goods not in free circulation in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, for example under <a class="govuk-link" href="#special-procedures-NI">special procedures</a>
</li>
  <li>any prohibited and restricted goods where the Joint Committee has agreed a declaration will be needed</li>
  <li>where the movement concerns EU goods and the movement started outside of <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, the exporter should comply with <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> export requirements applicable in their ‘home’ member state (<abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: where the goods are not in free circulation in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> and are intended for Free Circulation and Home Use in GB, for example third country goods under a special procedure in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, they could be released to the Free Circulation procedure in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, then moved to GB without the need to make an export declaration.</p>

<p>Where the intention is to enter into GB using a special procedure (for example, where further processing will take place in GB), the Special Procedure should be ended in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> using the appropriate re-export Procedure, before entering a further Special Procedure in GB. Please refer to the GB Tariff for the requirements of the GB import declaration. Goods cannot be moved into GB from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> using the same procedure in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> as the previous procedure.</p>

<p>Note: no entry safety and security declaration (ENS) is required in GB for direct <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB movements. Nor are import declarations required, provided that the goods fall within the definition of ‘<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> qualifying goods’ as defined under the Definition of Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and are not moved via Northern Ireland for an avoidance purpose.</p>

<p>The definition of ‘qualifying Northern Ireland goods’ is expected to be updated during the course of 2021 following further consultation with business. For further information on making an import declaration for non-qualifying goods (for example, third country goods entering a Special Procedure), see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-for-chief">UK Trade Tariff Volume 3 for <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from an EU member state to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Goods that are sent directly from an EU <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr> to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> do not require either a safety and security declaration or a customs declaration.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from an EU member state via <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB</h3>

<p>Goods that are sent from an EU <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr> to GB via <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> can enter GB without a customs import declaration or safety and security declaration provided that they are not excise goods, and they fall within the definition of ‘<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> qualifying goods’ as defined under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2020/9780348212969/contents" rel="external">Definition of Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a>, and are not moved via Northern Ireland for an avoidance purpose. The definition of ‘qualifying Northern Ireland goods’ is expected to be updated during the course of 2021 following further consultation with business. Export declarations should be made to the customs authority in the home <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr> unless the goods are below the low-value threshold of EUR3000.</p>

<p>Where excise goods are sent from an EU <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr> via <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB, an import declaration should be made on the system a trader currently uses for GB imports. However, provided that those goods are ‘qualifying goods’ for customs purposes (as defined under the Definition of Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods (EU Exit) Regulations 2020) and are not moved via <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> for an avoidance purpose, no customs duty is payable. If using <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, importers should use override code ‘DTY’ in box 47 to override any customs duty calculation and VAT override code ‘VAT’ to suppress the import VAT charge.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to an EU member state</h3>

<p>Goods that are sent from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to an EU <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr> do not require either a safety and security declaration or a customs declaration to be made.  For countries in the EU Customs Union movements will continue in the same way as they do today.</p>

<h3>Goods sent from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB via an EU member state</h3>

<p>An export declaration (indirect export from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) will be required in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to move goods to GB via an EU <abbr title="Member State">MS</abbr>, followed by an import declaration in GB. No customs duty is payable on <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>-IE-GB movements, provided that the goods are ‘qualifying goods’, i.e. were in free circulation in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> prior to starting their movement and were not moved via <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> for the purposes of avoiding UK duty.</p>

<p>This means that, where frontier declarations are submitted for <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>-IE-GB movements, importers or their agents should use override codes to suppress the customs duty calculation. In <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, this can be done by entering code ‘DTY’ in box 47. VAT override code ‘VAT’ should be used to suppress the import VAT charge and the supplier should account for VAT on their quarterly VAT return.</p>

<p>If importers have used ‘staged controls’ in GB to make an entry in their own records, the same process for suppressing customs duty and VAT calculation should be followed when supplementary declarations are submitted (using the override codes shown above).</p>

<h3>General notes</h3>

<p>This supplement explains how to read the current Volume 3 of the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Trade Tariff in respect of the new requirements until a full redraft of the documents is available.</p>

<p>In general, unless covered by a specific exemption, removal or amendment detailed in this document, all provisions/instructions in Volume 3 of the UK Trade Tariff for <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> still apply to the completion of a declaration, until further notice.</p>

<p>The separate ‘GB Tariff update for <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> and <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>’ should not be used when making declarations for imports into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>  or exports from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> - It should be noted that any facilitations/easements that are granted for use with imports and exports from/to GB and the EU, for example Staged Controls, are not applicable to imports into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> unless they are detailed in this document.</p>

<h3>Tariff Quotas</h3>

<p>For goods moving into Northern Ireland from outside the EU and UK, importers will not be able to access the EU Tariff quota for any goods. However, importers will be able to access the UK Tariff quota for goods determined to be not ‘at risk’ of being subsequently moved into the EU. More guidance will be published as soon as possible for goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. On <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>, all UK tariff quotas are recognised by an order number beginning with “05” (In <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> this relates to completion of DE 4/17 and DE 8/1).</p>

<h3>Preference</h3>

<p>Depending on the status of the goods (see ‘At-Risk and Not-at-Risk Goods’) importers may be able to access either UK Preference arrangements for not-at-risk goods or EU Preference arrangements for at-risk goods.</p>

<p>On <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>, users will continue to use the existing Preference codes as shown in the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Trade Tariff to access either UK or EU Preference arrangements.</p>

<h3>Meursing codes</h3>

<p>Where an <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> import declaration is made to a Commodity Code which has a requirement for a meursing code (goods containing certain types of milk and sugars covered Regulation (EC) No. 118/2010) in the EU Tariff, this code must be provided. This is regardless of whether the goods are determined to be At-Risk or Not-at-Risk.</p>

<h3>NOVA (Notification of Vehicle Arrivals)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will not provide Notification of Vehicle Arrivals (NOVA) services on 1 January 2021: Additional Procedure Code ‘1NV’ will not be valid in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> on 1 January 2021 until further notice.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>, NOVA will continue to operate as per the instructions in the Notices and published guidance. Arrival into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> or GB would be treated the same for VAT registered traders (non-VAT traders make manual declarations through the Cars team).</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> coding changes</h3>

<p>Non-GB EORIs must not be declared on <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>. This applies to all data elements requiring declaration of an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr>.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> starting GB is not held, an intermediary (customs agent) must be engaged to make the declaration, or a GB <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> obtained prior to the declaration being made.  For further information please see the changes to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customs-declaration-completion-requirements-for-the-northern-ireland-protocol/part-2-cds-declaration-completion-requirements-for-the-northern-ireland-protocol#country-code-prefixes-annexe">country code prefixes</a>.</p>

<h3>New XI prefix required</h3>

<p><abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> traders will require an <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> number with an XI prefix from 1 January 2021 when using NCTS to move goods under transit; ICS to submit Safety and Security (S and S) Declarations; and to access certain EU authorisations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will not be compatible with XI prefixes on 1 January 2021 and traders will need to use their GB prefixed <abbr title="Economic Operators Registration and Identification">EORI</abbr> on <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> until further notice, we will publish updated information well in advance of any change to XI.</p>

<h2>Special Procedures in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Declaration completion requirements for Special Procedures in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> for <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will not change apart from the additional requirements shown below.  Northern Ireland will operate under the <abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr> and authorisations and guarantees will be needed to be able to enter goods into a special procedure.</p>

<p>Standard <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> Additional Information Statements must still be declared on declarations in D.E 2/2 into or out of Special Procedures. This includes the ability to declare goods ‘not at risk’ using AI statements if the conditions for doing so are met.  Further guidance will be published once negotiations are finalised.</p>

<p>A valid authorisation will be needed to use Special Procedures in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Movements from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Where a declaration is required and the intention is to use one of the duty suspensive arrangements under Special Procedures, an import declaration to that procedure will be required in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>. For example, goods that will be brought to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> for processing before being removed from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> may use the Inward Processing procedure. A declaration is needed even if the authorisation holder is the same in GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>. An export declaration from GB will not be required.</p>

<p>Where goods are moving to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to be placed under the same Special Procedure as they were under in GB, they should be entered into the Special Procedure with the previous Procedure declared (e.g. Inward Processing in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> following Inward Processing in GB is declared as 5151 in DE 1/10).</p>

<h3>Movements from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to GB</h3>

<p>The Special Procedure must be ended in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> by either being discharged into free circulation or by using the appropriate re-export Procedure before entering a further Special Procedure in GB if required. Please refer to the GB Tariff for the requirements of the GB import declaration. The GB import declaration can be made either using <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> or <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> depending on the system a trader is operating.</p>

<h3>Imports from Rest of World to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h3>
<p>If goods are only processed in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, the current process applies as detailed in the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Tariff.</p>

<p>If goods are to be processed in both <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> and GB, the Special Procedure should either first be ended in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> by being discharged into free circulation or by using the appropriate re-export procedure before entering a further Special Procedure in GB.</p>

<h2>Definition of Exporter for Northern Ireland Exports</h2>

<p>For the purposes of Export Declarations from Northern Ireland:</p>

<p>Exporter is defined in Article 1(19) as:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)	a private individual carrying goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union where these goods are contained in the private individual’s personal baggage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)	in other cases where a) does not apply:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)	a person established in the customs territory of the Union who, has the power to determine and has determined that the goods are to be taken out of that customs territory;<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (ii)	Where (i) does not apply, any person established in the customs territory of the Union who is a party to the contract under which goods are to be taken out of that customs territory.</p>

<p>Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1063, amending Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/2446 provided additional clarification on the definition of the Exporter as follows:
‘…the new definition of ‘exporter’ should be less restrictive and limit the conditions for being an exporter to the essential requirements for the functioning of the export procedure: the exporter must have the power to determine that the goods are to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union and, in line with Article 170(2) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, the exporter must be established in the customs territory of the Union. Only in cases where the business partners do not agree on the person who may act as exporter or the person is not established in the customs territory of the Union, the exporter is determined by the customs legislation…’.</p>

<p>For details of how to complete the Exporter’s details on an <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> export declaration, please refer to 
the Export Declaration Completion Guide, Data Elements <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide/group-3-parties#de-31-exporter-box-2-consignor-exporter">3/1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-export-declaration-completion-guide/group-3-parties#de-32-exporter-identification-number-box-2-consignorexporter">3/2</a>.</p>

<p>This definition does not apply to imports.</p>

<p>This definition should not be used for exports from GB, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/customs-declaration-completion-requirements-for-great-britain">GB supplement</a> for details.</p>

<h2>UK Customs procedures, facilitations and schemes in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Low Value Bulking Imports (LVBI)</h3>

<p>Low Value Bulking Imports (LVBI) will be replaced by the Bulk Import Reduced Data Set (BIRDS) scheme in GB on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>However, BIRDS (ex LVBI as currently shown in the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Tariff) must not be used for <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> imports on 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR)</h3>

<p>VAT relief for goods with a value not exceeding £15 will be removed with effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>All goods imported from third countries (excluding qualifying gifts or where any other reliefs are available) will be liable to import VAT regardless of their value (including goods sent from the Channel Islands).</p>

<p>Please see the relevant sections of the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Annexe to identify the changes that will apply to the values applicable to certain Additional Procedure Codes (<abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>) from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h2>Changes to VAT treatment of overseas goods sold to customers from 1 January 2021</h2>

<p>HMRC has introduced changes to the treatment of goods imported into the UK with a value less than £135 - These changes come into effect on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/changes-to-vat-treatment-of-overseas-goods-sold-to-customers-from-1-january-2021/changes-to-vat-treatment-of-overseas-goods-sold-to-customers-from-1-january-2021">Changes to VAT treatment of overseas goods sold to customers from 1 January 2021</a> for further information on the requirements for these types of importation.</p>

<p>As per the guidance on GOV.UK, traders registered to account for import VAT on a VAT return must use Postponed VAT Accounting (PVA) at import. Please see the PVA sections of the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Annexe for further details.</p>

<h3>GB Staged Controls</h3>

<p>Please note that any GB easements or facilitations under Staged Controls (as shown in the GB Trade Tariff Update) do not apply to movements into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Special Fiscal Territories and countries with which the EU has a Customs Union</h3>

<p>The instructions in the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Trade Tariff should be followed, noting that in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> an EU Special Fiscal Territory (SFT) will continue to be treated as an SFT for the purposes of the <abbr title="The Northern Ireland Protocol">NIP</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, goods from a UK SFT (Bailiwicks of Jersey or Guernsey) will be treated with the same status as goods from GB. Applicable declaration categories in <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> will be either H1, H2, H3 or H4. However declaration category H5 is not applicable in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to movements from Jersey or Guernsey.</p>

<p>When submitting a declaration for goods from a UK SFT to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, DE 1/1 must be ‘IM’ and not ‘CO’ as currently shown in the Tariff, Additional Procedure Code ‘F15’ should be used in DE 1/11 and Additional Information Statement ‘NIIMP’ must be entered in DE 2/2.</p>

<h3>Transit</h3>

<p>The UK has reached agreement to retain membership of the Common Transit Convention (CTC) after the Transition Period so traders will be able to use Transit when moving goods between CTC countries. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-new-computerised-transit-system-to-move-goods-across-the-eu-and-efta-countries">New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) guidance</a> for further information on completing a declaration.</p>

<h3>Excise</h3>

<p>GB-<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> movements: where a movement of UK goods is being made from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>, the trader will be required to use the existing manual override functionality* in combination with a new AI statement ‘OVR06’ to manually calculate and input the correct excise duty liability, if the excise duty applicable to the goods when they enter <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> is higher than the excise duty already paid on the goods in GB.</p>

<p>An example of when this might happen is if there has been an increase in the excise duty rate, for example if there has been a budget rate change, between the time of first payment of the GB excise duty in GB and the time when those goods are moved into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<p>* AI statement ‘OVR01’ is entered in DE 2/2 to manually enter the customs charges due on goods. Please refer to the Procedure Code notes in the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> Trade Tariff for where AI statement ‘OVR01’ may be used for more information.</p>

<p>For further information on the description and usage of this code see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/additional-information-ai-statement-codes-for-data-element-22-of-the-customs-declaration-service-cds#table4B-national">Appendix 4 of the <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> UK Trade Tariff.</a></p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/moving-excise-goods-as-freight-under-the-northern-ireland-protocol-from-1-january-2021">excise guidance</a> for more information on excise freight movements.</p>

<p>See excise <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197#sect16">Notice 197</a> for more information on how to calculate excise duty.</p>

<h3>Guarantees</h3>

<p>The rules for guaranteeing actual and potential customs debts have changed for businesses that defer or suspend duties in Great Britain (GB). Guarantee requirements for duty deferment, Special Procedures and Temporary Storage have not changed for businesses using these procedures in <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> businesses will need to continue to provide a Customs Comprehensive Guarantee (CCG) in order to use duty deferment and be fully authorised to operate Special Procedures and Temporary Storage.</p>

<p>GB and <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> traders who regularly use transit procedures under the CTC to move goods to the EU and other CTC countries will still need a CCG.  However, they can apply to reduce the value of the guarantee they would otherwise need to provide by 50%, 70% or 100% if they can demonstrate a high degree of compliance, competence and financial solvency. Traders with AEOC status are already entitled to a 100% guarantee reduction for potential debts.</p>

<h3>Intrastat</h3>
<p>Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, HMRC is legally required to collect international trade statistics for goods exported from and imported to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>. As customs declarations will not be required for <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> trade with the EU, Intrastat will continue to operate for these movement of goods.</p>

<p>This means UK VAT registered businesses exporting goods from <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> to EU Member States or importing goods into <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> from EU Member States, with trade above the existing Intrastat arrivals or dispatches exemption thresholds, will be required to submit Intrastat declarations.</p>

<h2>Agri foods</h2>

<h3>Customs Declaration Completion Requirements for Goods subject to Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) checks under the Northern Ireland Protocol</h3>

<p>On 10 December 2020, the Government published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-northern-ireland-protocol">Command Paper</a> setting out details of an agreement in principle on the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol between the UK and the EU. In order to continue the smooth flow of trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, critical flexibilities to maintain the flow of food supplies were agreed with the EU.</p>

<p>Guidance on the processes that must now be followed when moving high risk food and feed of non-animal origin (HRFNAO) from Great Britain to Northern Ireland can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-high-risk-food-and-feed-of-non-animal-origin-to-the-eu-or-northern-ireland#exporting-hrfnao-from-great-britain-to-the-eu-or-moving-it-to-northern-ireland">here</a>.</p>

<p>As stated at the link <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-high-risk-food-and-feed-of-non-animal-origin-to-the-eu-or-northern-ireland#arrangements-for-authorised-traders-moving-food-from-great-britain-to-northern-ireland">here</a> the temporary arrangement the Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland (STAMNI) was extended from the original end date of 31 March 2021 to at least 1 October 2021 for authorised traders only. Where a trader is authorised by Defra, they will be notified by Defra in writing and will be provided with the declaration completion rules that must be followed where a movement from GB to <abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr> is made for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fruit and vegetables</li>
  <li>plants and plant related products</li>
  <li>live animals</li>
  <li>products of animal origin</li>
  <li>high risk food and feed not of animal origin</li>
  <li>fish caught under Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU) Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a temporary solution for traders making declarations on <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr> for agri-food goods and further guidance will be issued in due course when these arrangements are due to change.</p>

<p>If a trader has not been authorised by Defra for use of the temporary STAMNI arrangements, they must observe the requirements shown <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/exporting-or-moving-high-risk-food-and-feed-of-non-animal-origin-to-the-eu-or-northern-ireland#exporting-hrfnao-from-great-britain-to-the-eu-or-moving-it-to-northern-ireland">here</a>. The Defra guidance should be read in conjunction with the information and instructions on the completion of a customs declaration in the Trade Tariff Volume 3 for <abbr title="Customs Declaration Service">CDS</abbr>, alongside the information in this Supplement.</p>
