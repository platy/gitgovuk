</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Politics</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Parliament</h3>

<p>The supreme decision-making authority in Finland is exercised by Parliament. The Finnish Parliament is unicameral and has 200 members. The 200 Members of Parliament are elected every four years using a direct proportional system. The next parliamentary elections will take place in 2023.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Government</h3>

<p>Finnish governments tend to be multi-party coalition governments to reach a parliamentary majority. The coalition governments are usually formed by between 3 to 5 parties. The current centre-left government was formed in May 2019 by the Social Democrats and consists of the following 5 parties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social Democratic Party</li>
  <li>Centre Party</li>
  <li>the Greens</li>
  <li>Left Alliance</li>
  <li>Swedish People’s Party of Finland</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Political priorities</h3>

<p>Some of the main issues the government is focusing on includes securing sustainable economic growth and higher employment, reforming social security and restructuring health and social services, and different measures to meet the challenges of an ageing population. The government focused on an ambitious climate policy to ensure that Finland is carbon neutral by 2035.</p>

<p>Education and research are a key strategic objectives. The upper age limit of compulsory education is now 18. The government supports growth by investments in digitalisation, 5G/6G, sustainability and clean technologies. Low carbon energy solutions and future of mobility are also supported by policies. Attracting more top international talent to Finland is important due to shortage of skilled employees in a fast-ageing society.  The government has significantly increased investments in rail transport and infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>In the EU, Finland seeks an active role and wants to support the EU’s unity and external ability to act. Finland is a firm supporter of trade liberalisation and a more competitive EU, and supports efforts to boost free trade and the single (and digital) market. Finland remains committed to the single currency, strengthening Economic and Monetary Union and supporting closer integration of the EU. Finland does not, however, actively support further treaty changes and think that integration can be deepened within the existing framework.</p>

<p>Finland is a strong supporter of the international rule-based system and multilateral cooperation. Foreign policy objectives, besides foreign trade, include sustainable development, combating climate change, conflict prevention and crisis management and promoting human rights and equality. More information on political risk, including political demonstrations, is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland">FCDO Travel Advice</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Economics</h2>

<p>The largest sector of the Finnish economy is services at 69.4%, followed by industry and construction at 28%. The economy is innovation-driven and ranks high in digitalisation. Finland ranks number 2 in Europe in the EU’s Digital Economy and Society Index for 2021.</p>

<p>Finland is highly integrated in the global economy and international trade accounts for more than a third of GDP. The EU accounts for 60% of trade in goods. Main good exports include chemical industry products, pulp and paper, processed metal products, electrical and optical equipment, machinery and vehicles, and increasingly health technology.</p>

<p>Trade in services has grown fast and export of services today is the highest growing area of exports, with approximately 30% of total exports. Digital services are the most important subsector.</p>

<p>Finland retains Aa1 / AA+ credit ratings with a stable outlook from Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Standard&amp;Poor’s. GDP grew by 3.5% in 2021, according to the OECD, as Finland recovers from the economic hit of the pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>Finland’s constitution encompasses a wide range of civic, political, economic and social rights which aim at ensuring fair treatment and equality for all. Finland ratified the 2 UN-conventions safeguarding these rights, the ICCPR and the ICESCR, in 1966. Discrimination on the basis of age, ethnic or national origin, nationality, language, religion, opinion, health, disability or sexual preference is against the law in Finland.</p>

<p>Finland was the third country in the world to give women voting rights and the first country to elect women into parliament in 1906. Women are entitled to 105 working days’ paid maternity leave, and either parent can stay at home until the child is 3 years of age with their job secured. The right of every child to receive municipal day care is also protected by law.</p>

<p>Trade union membership has traditionally been common in Finland but at 59%, membership is on a downward trend. Unions operate proactively with the employers’ organisations to guarantee overarching agreements of terms and conditions of employment as well as wage levels. Progress towards more locally agreed terms and conditions has been slow, but the trend is towards a reduction in the significance of collective bargaining.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>According to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021" rel="external">Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI)</a>, Finland was ranked joint first place of 180 countries in 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Terrorism</h2>

<p>There is a low threat from terrorism. But you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks, which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers. Please read the information provided on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad">terrorism threat</a> page.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Protective security advice</h2>

<p>Crime levels remain relatively low. The tourist season attracts pickpockets in crowded areas. You should observe sensible precautions such as keeping your personal belongings, including passports and money, secure.</p>
