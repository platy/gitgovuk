<h2>Temporary change to ongoing consumption requests</h2>

<p>For one year from 1 April 2022 energy suppliers can no longer request new deductions or increased payments from a claimant’s benefit to pay for ongoing fuel consumption.</p>

<p>Claimants can still request deductions for ongoing consumption payments if they choose to do so, or increase any existing payments.</p>

<p>The reason for this change is to give claimants greater control over what could be significant deductions from their benefit during a period of unprecedented energy prices.</p>
</div>

<h2>What is a third party deduction</h2>
<p>The third party deduction scheme is designed to protect claimants in receipt of income-related benefits. Third party deductions for fuel debt is sometimes called ‘Fuel Direct’. It is used when a claimant has arrears of essential household outgoings.  Other methods to recover the debt must have been tried, for example negotiating different ways of paying and managing bills. There must be a real possibility of enforcement action before consideration is given to applying for a deduction .</p>

<h2>Why a third party deduction is taken</h2>
<p>Third party deductions act as a safety-net to protect claimants when they have debts for essential household bills.</p>

<p>Fuel suppliers should take reasonable action to recover the arrears before applying for deductions.</p>

<p>The following benefits may have a third party deduction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Universal Credit - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-third-party-deductions-universal-credit">information on applying for deductions from Universal Credit</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the scheme works</h2>
<p>We deduct a fixed amount towards the arrears. This is legislated for in Schedule 9 of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. The amount is deducted from the individual’s benefit at source and paid directly to the supplier until the debt is cleared.</p>

<p>The benefit claimant can also ask for an additional amount to be deducted to cover current consumption costs. This is to prevent further debt accruing and to help the claimant with budgeting.</p>

<p>Where an individual pays for their on-going consumption by use of a pre-payment meter, only an arrears deduction may be taken.</p>

<p>Once a debt is paid off, a third party deduction will usually end. In some cases where the individual repeatedly mismanages their money, a deduction may continue to cover on-going costs.</p>

<p>Where there is more than one debt, we can take a maximum of 3 deductions at any one time. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will apply the <a class="govuk-link" href="#debts-covered-by-the-scheme">priority order</a> when more than 3 applications are made.</p>

<p>For changes to current usage we will change the amount deducted based on the current amount used by the claimant based on a meter reading, but not for an amount based on an estimate.</p>

<h2>Debts covered by the scheme</h2>
<p>The types of debt covered by the scheme are rated in a priority order. This reflects the degree of risk to the individual or their family by the enforcement action that may result from non-payment. The order is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>housing costs for specific mortgage arrears</li>
  <li>miscellaneous accommodation costs; care homes, private hospitals</li>
  <li>hostel charges</li>
  <li>rent arrears, including service charges</li>
  <li>mains fuel costs; gas and electricity</li>
  <li>water charges; water then sewerage if two debts</li>
  <li>Council Tax and community charge arrears</li>
  <li>fines</li>
  <li>Child Support Maintenance under the old scheme</li>
  <li>refugee integration loans</li>
  <li>eligible loans</li>
</ol>

<h2>What can be included in the debt</h2>
<p>The total debt may include any legal or other costs incurred to recover the arrears, and any re-connection charges.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>Two groups can apply to the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the claimant or their representatives can apply for deductions to pay for arrears and current consumption</li>
  <li>the creditor or their billing agent can apply for deductions to pay for arrears only</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>If a claimant wants to pay ongoing consumption but has no arrears deduction in place, they must contact the office that pays their benefit.</p>
</div>

<p>Use the industry standard application form from Ofgem to apply for a third party deduction.  Please contact Ofgem if you don’t know how to find your application form or if you don’t already have one.</p>

<p>Send the completed form to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>&nbsp;office that deals with the claimant’s benefits. The claimant’s benefit award letter contains this information.</p>

<h2>Content of the application</h2>
<p>We must be able to identify the claimant from the details on the application for deductions. It should include the following where possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claimant’s name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>National Insurance number, if known, although applications will be accepted without this</li>
  <li>name and address of the creditor making the application</li>
  <li>the AP number of the creditor</li>
  <li>the customer reference number</li>
  <li>type of benefit being paid to the claimant, if known</li>
  <li>other payment methods which have been tried</li>
  <li>amount of the debt</li>
  <li>any figure to cover current consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>We may need further information before making a decision, normally where the claimant has made the application, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of the debt</li>
  <li>the weekly current consumption costs</li>
  <li>any other information needed to process the application including details of:
    <ul>
      <li>the claimant’s identity on the bill</li>
      <li>an application for a charitable trust grant</li>
      <li>a different tariff if needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Consent for deductions</h2>
<p>Most third party deductions are imposed but there are some occasions where consent is needed from the individual. This applies where the total amount of all deductions including any amounts to cover current costs, exceeds 25% of the main benefit, including any Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit in payment. We will identify these cases and ask for consent. Consent only applies for the following debt types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing cost arrears not covered by the Mortgage Interest Direct scheme</li>
  <li>rent and service charges</li>
  <li>fuel costs</li>
  <li>water charges</li>
  <li>integration loans</li>
  <li>eligible loans</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we decide if a third party deduction is appropriate</h2>
<p>We will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the individual is receiving one of the specified benefits in section 2</li>
  <li>if there is a threat of enforcement action</li>
  <li>if there are outstanding arrears</li>
  <li>if the individual or their partner is liable for the debt - an individual or their partner will normally be liable for the debt if named on the bill; there may be occasions where we cannot make third party deductions, for instance deductions may not be made if the debt is the responsibility of a partner who has left the household</li>
  <li>if a deduction is in the interests of the family</li>
  <li>if the individual will be left with sufficient amount of benefit (10p benefit) to qualify for other linked benefits such as prescriptions, Housing Benefit and local Council Tax Reduction</li>
  <li>if the debt takes priority over other debts - if there are already 3 other deductions for arrears in place, we will check the priority list in section 4; if the new request is for a higher priority debt, the lowest priority deduction will be stopped</li>
  <li>if consent is needed - if so, we will take action to ask the claimant for their consent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>Payment is made into a nominated bank account every 4 weeks in arrears. It may take up to 6 weeks before the first payment is received. We can take a maximum of 3 deductions at any one time.</p>
