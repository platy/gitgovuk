<h2>
<span class="number">1.&nbsp;What </span> is a third party deduction</h2>

<p>The third party deduction scheme is designed to protect claimants in receipt of income-related benefits. It is used when a claimant has arrears of essential household outgoings and has failed to budget for these bills. Other methods to recover the debt must have been tried, for example negotiating different ways of paying and managing bills. There must be a threat of enforcement action before consideration is given to applying for a deduction.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the Water Supplier to ensure their customer knows they are requesting a deduction from their benefit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2.&nbsp;Why </span> a third party deduction is taken</h2>

<p>Third party deductions act as a safety-net to protect claimants when they have debts for essential household bills. They are only taken when it is in the interest of the individual or family. In the case of water debt, this is to prevent the extra costs of court action and subsequent effect on credit scores.</p>

<p>Water suppliers should take reasonable action to recover the arrears before applying for deductions.</p>

<p>The following benefits may have a third party deduction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
  <li>Universal Credit – <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-third-party-deductions-universal-credit">information on applying for deductions from Universal Credit</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3.&nbsp;How </span> the scheme works</h2>

<p>We deduct a fixed amount to clear the arrears. The amount is deducted from the individual’s benefit at source and paid directly to the supplier until the debt is cleared.</p>

<p>An additional amount is taken to cover current consumption costs. This is to prevent further debt accruing and to help with budgeting in the future. This figure should be an average amount based on annual usage.</p>

<p>Where there are 2 billing agents, one for water supply and one for waste water, the water debt is cleared first, then the arrears for sewerage. There can’t be two deductions for water debts running at the same time.</p>

<p>Once a debt is paid, a third party deduction will usually end. In some cases where the individual repeatedly mismanages their money, a deduction may continue to cover on-going costs.</p>

<p>Where there is more than one debt, we can take a maximum of 3 deductions at any one time.&nbsp;The Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)&nbsp;will apply the priority order when more than 3 applications are made.</p>

<p>For changes to current usage we will alter the sum deducted based on the current amount used by the claimant. This must be confirmed by a meter reading, not an estimate.</p>

<h3>Legal Power/Gateway</h3>

<p>Third Party deductions is legislated for in Schedule 9 to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4.&nbsp;Debts </span> covered by the scheme</h2>

<p>The types of debt covered by the scheme are rated in a priority order. This reflects the degree of risk to the individual or their family by the enforcement action that may result from non-payment. The order is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>housing costs for specific mortgage arrears</li>
  <li>miscellaneous accommodation costs; care homes, private hospitals</li>
  <li>hostel charges</li>
  <li>rent arrears including service charges</li>
  <li>mains fuel costs; gas and electricity</li>
  <li>water charges; water then sewerage if two debts</li>
  <li>Council Tax and community charge arrears</li>
  <li>fines</li>
  <li>Child Support maintenance under the old scheme</li>
  <li>refugee integration loans</li>
  <li>eligible loans</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.&nbsp;What </span> can be included in the debt</h2>

<p>The total debt may include any legal or other costs incurred to recover the arrears.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.&nbsp;Who </span> can apply</h2>

<p>Two groups can apply to the scheme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the claimant or their representatives</li>
  <li>the creditor or their billing agent</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the industry standard application form from Ofwat to apply for a third party deduction. Please contact Ofwat if you don’t know how to find your application form or if you don’t already have one. Alternatively contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:thirdparty.deductions@dwp.gov.uk">thirdparty.deductions@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Send the completed form to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>&nbsp;benefit or pension centre that deals with the claimant’s benefits. The claimant’s benefit award letter contains this information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7.&nbsp;Personal </span> Data Items</h2>

<p>We must be able to identify the claimant from the details on the application for deductions. This should include the following where possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>claimant’s name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>National Insurance number, if known, although applications will be accepted without this</li>
  <li>name and address of the creditor making the application</li>
  <li>the AP number of the creditor</li>
  <li>the customer reference number</li>
  <li>type of benefit being paid to the claimant, if known</li>
  <li>other payment methods which have been tried</li>
  <li>amount of the debt</li>
  <li>any figure to cover current consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>We may need further information before making a decision, normally where the claimant has made the application, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of the debt</li>
  <li>the weekly current consumption costs</li>
  <li>any other information needed to process the application including details of:
    <ul>
      <li>an application for a charitable trust grant</li>
      <li>an application for a repayment scheme incentive</li>
      <li>access to Watersure or any other social tariff</li>
      <li>any disputes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will receive either confirmation that the deductions have been put in place or rejected by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. The customer will also be sent a notification informing them that deductions will be taken from their benefits.</p>

<p>The processing covered in this document is already mentioned in the organisations existing central record of processing activities</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9.&nbsp;Permission </span> for Deductions</h2>

<p>Most third party deductions are imposed but there are some occasions where consent is needed from the individual. This applies where the total amount of all deductions including any amounts to cover current costs, exceeds 25% of the main benefit, including any Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit in payment. We will identify these cases and ask for consent. Consent only applies for the following debt types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>housing cost arrears not covered by the Mortgage Interest Direct scheme</li>
  <li>rent and service charges</li>
  <li>fuel costs</li>
  <li>water charges</li>
  <li>integration loans</li>
  <li>eligible loans</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.&nbsp;How </span> we decide if a third party deduction is appropriate</h2>

<p>We will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the individual is receiving one of the specified benefits in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect-2">section 2</a>
</li>
  <li>if there is a threat of enforcement</li>
  <li>if there are outstanding arrears</li>
  <li>if other methods of repayment have been tried and failed</li>
  <li>if the individual or their partner is liable for the debt - an individual or their partner will normally be liable for the debt if named on the bill; there may be occasions where we cannot make third party deductions, for instance deductions may not be made if the debt is the responsibility of a partner who has left the household</li>
  <li>if a deduction is in the interests of the family</li>
  <li>if the individual will be left with sufficient amount of benefit (10p benefit) to qualify for other linked benefits such as prescriptions, Housing Benefit and local Council Tax Reduction</li>
  <li>if the debt takes priority over other debts - if there are already 3 other deductions for arrears in place, we will check the priority list in section 4; if the new request is for a higher priority debt, the lowest priority deduction will be stopped</li>
  <li>if permission is needed - if so, we will take action to ask the claimant for their consent</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="number">11.&nbsp;Payments </span></h2>

<p>Payment are made into a nominated bank account every 4 weeks in arrears. It may take up to 6 weeks before the first payment is received. We can take a maximum of 3 deductions at any one time.</p>

<p>A payment schedule will be issued detailing the Customer Reference Number, National Insurance Number and the amount of deductions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Legal Basis</h2>

<p>Under <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">UKGDPR</abbr> the lawful basis for this processing activity is Article 6(1) (e) - Public Task. It is not expected that special categories of personal data would be shared by the supplier, but if such data is processed by the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> when making a decision on the supplier’s request, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would rely on Art 9(2) (g) - processing is necessary for exercising specific rights of the controller in the field of social security</p>

<p>While <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will have a legal gateway to share personal data with water companies, the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and water companies will be relying on <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">UKGDPR</abbr> public task</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Data Controller Relationship</h2>

<p>The Data Controller Relationship for this initiative has been determined to be ‘Controller to Controller’.</p>

<p>This has been applied as both the water supplier and the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have different purposes to process customer data and make decisions independent of one another. The water supplier will be the Data Controller and be responsible for obligations under the data protection legislation until the customer’s data is received by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, at this point <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will become the Data Controller of that personal information.</p>
