<h2>How to enter a positive test result</h2>

<p>If you did a rapid lateral flow test at home, and the result was positive, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report a coronavirus (COVID-19) rapid lateral flow test result</a> on GOV.UK. You may get an 8-character long code from the testing service, by email or text which you can input into the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>Privately purchased test kits are not linked to the NHS and will therefore not be recognised via the NHS reporting portal or the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>By inputting a test result to the NHS COVID-19 app, the app can give you the latest guidance. You can also choose to share your result anonymously with other app users who have spent time near you, or in ‘close contact’, over the last few days. These alerts will never identify you as an individual and will help others to take steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you are under 18 years old, and test positive for COVID-19, you should notify a trusted adult before taking any action.</p>

<h3>If you get an error message when trying to enter your result</h3>

<p>You may get the following error message when you try to link your COVID-19 test result to the app:
‘Code not recognised. Please make sure you are using a valid code.’</p>

<p>Check that you’ve entered your 8-character code correctly, and make sure you’re on version 4.4 or higher of the app.</p>

<p>Privately purchased test kits are not linked to the NHS and will therefore not be recognised via the NHS reporting portal or the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<p>If you’ve entered the code correctly, have version 4.4 or higher of the app, and still get this message, it may be because you’ve entered the code multiple times.</p>

<p>If your code has linked successfully to the app, it will appear under ‘Last applicable test result’ in the Other data section of your app settings.</p>

<p>In this instance, your code has linked to the app successfully and you do not need to enter it again.</p>

<p>If your code has not linked successfully to the app, this is probably due to bad internet connectivity when you were trying to enter the code. The app allows you to enter the code twice within a 4 hour period. If both attempts fail, the code is no longer valid and you’ll get the ‘Code not recognised’ error message.</p>

<h2>How to input symptoms</h2>

<p>You can enter your symptoms into the app by selecting the ‘Check symptoms’ button. You’ll be asked a number of simple questions with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers. When you’ve answered the questions, you can check the summary of your answers before you submit this information to the app. The app will provide relevant guidance based on your answers and where you live. Keep the app up to date to ensure you receive the latest health guidance. Guidance may differ between England and Wales.</p>

<p>You can report symptoms up to 5 days in the past.</p>

<h2>How to update the app</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 app is frequently updated with improvements to content, accessibility and functionality. It is important that you keep the app updated to ensure that you receive the latest advice and guidance.</p>

<p>Depending on your phone and app update settings, the app may update by itself.</p>

<p>You can read further information on how to enable automatic app upgrade, or how to manually upgrade:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en-GB" rel="external">how to update apps on Android</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202180" rel="external">how to update apps on Apple</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As the app uses technology from Apple and Google, it’s also important to make sure you’re using the latest version of your phone’s operating system.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when an update to the app is very important, we may send you a message asking you to update your app or operating system.</p>

<h2>How to use the app in another country</h2>

<p>The app is available in England and Wales. If you travel to Northern Ireland, Jersey or Gibraltar, you can continue using the NHS COVID-19 app and do not need to download their contact tracing apps. You will still get alerts if you’ve been in close contact with someone who later reported a positive test result in their contact tracing app.</p>

<p>If you travel to any other country outside of Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar which has a contact tracing app, you will not receive any contact tracing alerts as a result of close contacts with users of other countries’ apps who test positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms, test positive for COVID-19 or get an exposure notification, while you are away from home, you should always follow the local guidance of the country you are in.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/" rel="external">Get help with COVID-19 enquiries service</a> is available if you have a specific enquiry about international travel.</p>

<h2>How to delete the app</h2>

<p>The app isn’t mandatory and you’ll always be able to delete the app whenever you want.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to delete apps on your smartphone are available for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph248b543ca/ios" rel="external">Apple iPhones</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2521768?hl=en-GB" rel="external">Android phones</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to delete the app, you’ll no longer receive alerts and notifications.</p>
