<p>If you live in England or Wales, and are 16 or over, you can download the app on your phone.</p>

<h2>Phones and other devices</h2>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-19-app-download-and-set-up-guide#changing-the-language">using the app in a different language</a>.</p>

<h3>Phones the NHS COVID-19 app will work on</h3>

<p>The app currently supports Apple iOS versions 13.5 and higher and Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow) and higher. This is because the app uses technologies only available in these versions. While the app does work on iOS version 13.5, we recommend you upgrade to version 14 or higher.</p>

<p>The app will not work on phones that do not support Android or Apple (iOS).</p>

<p>The app does not work on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple phones using lower than iOS 13.5 (includes iPhone 6, 6 Plus and earlier models)</li>
  <li>Android phones using lower than version 6.0 (Marshmallow)</li>
  <li>Windows phones launched before May 2019</li>
  <li>Huawei phones launched from May 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>Your phone must have Bluetooth enabled for contact tracing to work.</p>

<h3>Other devices</h3>

<p>The app is not designed for use on laptops, PCs, smart watches or iPads. The app is designed for use on smartphones only because for contact tracing to be effective, it needs to be on a device that you carry with you most of the time.</p>

<p>You can use the app on Android tablets. The tablet must have a sim card so it can use a mobile connection, for example 4G or 5G.</p>

<p>If you have a compatible smartphone and cannot install the app, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/create-case/" rel="external">report a technical problem</a>.</p>

<h2>Children and the app</h2>

<p>If your child is aged 16 or over, they can download and use the app.</p>

<p>Although those aged 16 and over can use the app in education settings, the main benefit is outside that, when they are socialising, using public transport, or in a public space.</p>

<p>If a 16 or 17 year old receives an alert through the app, they are advised to show the message to a trusted adult.</p>

<p>The age limit is aligned to wider NHS services which generally consider those aged 16 and above to have sufficient maturity and capacity to make decisions relating to health care.</p>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance may be different for children and adults.</p>

<h2>Healthcare workers and the app</h2>

<p>Healthcare workers are advised to pause contact tracing while they are working in healthcare buildings, including hospitals and GP surgeries.</p>

<p>Read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-19-app-download-and-set-up-guide#pausing-contact-tracing">how and when to pause contact tracing</a>.</p>

<p>This advice is being given as healthcare workers are working in highly specialised secure environments, trained in infection prevention and control processes, and wearing medical-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as required. Specialist contact tracing controls are in place to understand how staff are moving around the building and when they are at risk of contracting COVID-19.</p>

<p>If a healthcare worker believes that they’ve been in contact with COVID-19, or gets an alert telling them that they’ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive, they should refer to their local public health risk assessment process.</p>
