<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This user guide to the Home Office’s ‘Migrant Journey’ reports (formerly 
known as ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ visa and leave status’) is 
designed to be a useful reference guide with explanatory notes on the issues 
and classifications which are key to the production and presentation of this 
release. The release explores changes in non-European Economic Area (non-EEA) 
migrants’ visa and leave status as they journey through the UK’s immigration 
system.</p>

<h3>Statistics covered</h3>

<p>The findings presented in this release are based on administrative data for 
migrants granted leave to enter, or remain in, the UK in the following routes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>Work (including dependants)</li>
  <li>Study (including dependants)</li>
  <li>Dependants joining or accompanying</li>
  <li>Asylum</li>
</ul>

<p>Both main applicants and dependants are included within the report and all 
references to High value worker, Skilled worker, Temporary worker, and 
Sponsored study visas include Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 5, or Tier 4 respectively 
as well as their pre-points-based system (PBS) equivalents.</p>

<p>It is not possible to tell from the data whether individuals are currently in 
the UK.</p>

<p>The report focuses on migrant journeys where a journey is defined as a series 
of grants of leave, or extensions of stay, with no more than 12 months 
between the end of one leave period and the start of the next. This 
definition is consistent with the UN definition of migration.</p>

<p>Where the report refers to cohorts of migrants initially issued leave , only 
journeys for which the first recorded grant of leave was an <strong>out-of-country 
visa or a grant of Asylum</strong> are included (this is also true for tables MJ_01 – 
MJ_04 and dataset MJ_D01).</p>

<p>Where the report talks about cohorts of people granted settlement, all 
journeys are included regardless of whether the initial grant was in-country 
or out-of-country (this is also true for tables MJ_05 and MJ_06, and dataset 
MJ_D02).</p>

<p>In all cases, the ‘initial leave category’ relates to the first recorded 
instance of leave. Therefore, the ‘Protection’ category in MJ_D02 relates 
only to those whose first recorded leave instance was asylum, humanitarian 
protection, alternative forms of leave or resettlement. It does not include 
those who were initially granted a different type of leave before claiming 
asylum.</p>

<p>Further summary details on the method adopted, who is covered, and 
presentation is included at the beginning of the report itself.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The ‘Migrant Journey’ provides evidence on the behaviour of migrants and is 
based on UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) administrative data sources. The 
purpose is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to inform understanding of the processes that migrants go through when 
they decide to stay in the UK or switch their status</li>
  <li>to help inform users (including government, Parliament, the media and the 
wider public)</li>
  <li>to support the development and monitoring of policy on settlement of 
migrants in the UK and permanent and temporary migration routes</li>
</ul>

<p>The current system of immigration control is based on the Immigration Act 
1971, which came into force on 1 January 1973, and subsequent amendments to 
the law. Policy and operational changes, as well as external drivers of 
immigration, such as global events and economics, can affect the figures. The 
availability and allocation of resources within the Home Office can affect 
the number of decisions made.</p>

<p>Further information on the work of the Home Office can be found in its annual 
report and in publications referred to in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#other-sources-of-information-on-immigration-and-migration">Other sources of information on immigration and migration section</a>
of this user guide.</p>

<h3>Terms</h3>

<p>Within an explanation of a term, words in bold are explained elsewhere in the 
glossary.</p>

<p>An <strong>asylum applicant</strong> is a person who either: (a) makes a request to be 
recognised as a refugee under the Geneva Convention on the basis that it 
would be contrary to the UK’s obligations under the Geneva Convention for him 
to be removed from or required to leave the UK; or (b) otherwise makes a 
request for international protection.</p>

<p><strong>European Economic Area (EEA) family permit</strong>: A family permit is issued 
overseas to direct and extended family members of an EEA national who is in, 
or intends to come to, the UK to exercise free movement rights. Under the 
Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, Swiss nationals are included in the 
definition of EEA nationals. Family members of Swiss nationals have the same 
free movement rights as family members of EEA nationals.</p>

<p><strong>Entry clearance</strong> takes the form of a sticker, also called a vignette, which is 
placed in a person’s travel document. Entry clearance can be called a visa 
(for visa nationals), an entry certificate (for non-visa nationals), or a 
family permit for family members of EEA nationals. These documents are to be 
taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility to travel to the UK, and 
accordingly accepted as ‘entry clearances’ within the meaning of the 
Immigration Act 1971. The term ‘visa’ may be used as a generic term for all 
types of entry clearance but in Immigration Statistics, it does not refer to 
an entry certificate.</p>

<p>An <strong>entry clearance visa</strong> is a document permitting the bearer to travel to the 
UK and leave to enter from the date of issue. It is activated upon passing 
through UK immigration control. There are three categories of visa: 
temporary, leading to settlement and settlement. Visas are required by 
nationals or citizens of the countries and territorial entities listed in 
Appendix 1 of the Immigration Rules known as ‘visa nationals’. Nationals of 
countries not on this list are known as ‘non-visa nationals’. A non-visa 
national does not need a visa to come to the UK for less than six months, 
unless it is a requirement of the immigration category under which they are 
entering. A non-visa national coming to the UK for more than six months will 
need a visa.</p>

<p>The <strong>EEA</strong> consists of the 27 countries of the <strong>European Union</strong>, plus Iceland, 
Liechtenstein and Norway. Nationals of the EEA and Switzerland have rights of 
free movement within the UK until the end of the Transition period on 31 
December 2020.</p>

<p>The <strong>European Union (EU)</strong> consists of 27 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, 
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Extension of stay</strong>, see <strong>leave to remain below</strong>. This is distinct from <strong>visa</strong>, 
which relates to <strong>entry clearance</strong> obtained prior to travel.</p>

<p><strong>Family route</strong> is for those seeking to enter or remain in the UK on the basis 
of their family life with a person who is a British Citizen, is settled in 
the UK, or is in the UK with limited leave as a refugee or person granted 
humanitarian protection (and the applicant cannot seek leave to enter or 
remain in the UK as their family member under Part 11 of the Immigration 
Rules).</p>

<p><strong>Family life (10-year) route</strong>: Partners and parents who apply in the UK and are 
granted <strong>leave to remain</strong> on a 10-year route to <strong>settlement</strong> on the basis of 
their family life where the relevant provisions in Appendix FM to the 
Immigration Rules (including EX.1) apply.</p>

<p><strong>Indefinite leave to remain</strong> is a grant of <strong>settlement</strong> (after entry) to a 
non-EEA national.</p>

<p><strong>Leave to remain</strong> is permission to stay in the UK either temporarily (limited 
leave to remain) or permanently (<strong>indefinite leave to remain</strong>). In this 
release, an extension of leave to remain is known as ‘<strong>extension of stay</strong>’ and 
indefinite leave to remain is known as ‘<strong>settlement</strong>’.</p>

<p>The <strong>points-based system (PBS)</strong> was  the main route for non-EEA nationals until 
late 2020 working and studying in the UK. It consisted of five ‘tiers’. See 
the definitions for the individual tiers, <strong>Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 and 
Tier 5</strong> for further information.</p>

<p><strong>Private life</strong>: grant of <strong>leave to remain</strong> in the UK because the person has 
established a private life in the UK. In order to be eligible to apply for 
leave to remain on the basis of private life in the UK, the applicant must 
have resided continuously in the UK for at least 20 years or be able to 
demonstrate that there are very significant obstacles to their integration in 
the country to which they would return. For young people aged between 18 and 
24 the applicant must have resided continuously in the UK for at least half 
of their life, and for children aged under 18, the applicant must have 
resided continuously in the UK for at least 7 years and show that it would 
not be reasonable to expect them to leave the UK. Applicants can only apply 
for this route from within the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Refugee</strong> is defined, by the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol (the ‘Refugee Convention’), as being a 
person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of 
race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or 
political opinion, is outside the country of their nationality or habitual 
residence, where stateless and who is unable or, owing to such a fear, is 
unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country. Recognition 
of refugee status by the UK is a pre-requisite to a grant of asylum in the 
country.</p>

<p><strong>Settlement</strong> is a grant of indefinite leave to enter (on arrival) or <strong>indefinite 
leave to remain</strong> (after entry) to a non-EEA national.</p>

<p><strong>Students</strong> are non-EEA nationals travelling to the UK primarily or solely for 
the purpose of study.</p>

<p>The <strong>short-term study</strong> category replaced the student visitor category on 24 
April 2015 and provides for those people who wish to come to the UK in order 
to undertake a short course of study, or short period of research as part of 
a degree course, which will be completed within the period of their leave 
(maximum six months unless applying under the concession for English language 
courses – 11 months). Short-term students cannot work, including undertaking 
a paid or unpaid work placement as part of their course. They are distinct 
from students arriving on <strong>Sponsored study</strong> visas, though some such visas may 
be a short duration.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> of the <strong>PBS</strong>: For high-value individuals who will contribute to growth 
and productivity. This tier is now captured in the ‘High value’ work category.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2</strong> of the <strong>PBS</strong>: For skilled workers from outside the EEA with a skilled 
job offer to fill gaps in the UK labour force. This tier is now captured in 
the ‘Skilled worker’ category.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 3</strong> of the <strong>PBS</strong>: For limited numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fill 
specific temporary labour shortages (this was never implemented).</p>

<p><strong>Tier 4</strong> of the <strong>PBS</strong>: Students. This tier is now captured in the ‘Sponsored 
study’ category</p>

<p><strong>Tier 5</strong> of the <strong>PBS</strong>: Youth mobility and temporary workers: people allowed to 
work in the UK for a limited period of time to satisfy primarily non-economic 
objectives. This tier is now captured in the ‘Temporary worker’ category.</p>

<p><strong>Visa</strong>: see <strong>Entry clearance</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>visa national</strong> is: a national of a country listed as requiring a visa for 
any type of entry to the UK; a stateless person; a holder of a non-national 
travel document unless issued by the UK; or a holder of a passport issued by 
an authority that is not recognised in the UK. Visa nationals must obtain 
<strong>entry clearance</strong> before travelling to the UK, except in certain circumstances, 
unless they are returning residents or those with permission to stay who are 
returning after a temporary absence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Conventions</h2>

<h4>Rounding</h4>

<p>Data are provided unrounded. This is to promote transparency and allow users 
to exploit the data further.</p>

<p>However, caution should be taken when comparing small differences between 
time periods. While care is taken in collecting and collating all the 
information obtained, the figures are subject to the inaccuracies inherent in 
any large recording system and are not necessarily accurate to the last 
digit. There are a range of different types of errors possible, such as those 
resulting from recording errors or misclassifications.</p>

<p>Percentages are rounded to the nearest per cent using the 
round-half-away-from-zero method.</p>

<p>The round-half-away-from-zero method has been used so that in the borderline 
case where the fraction of the percentage is exactly 0.5, the rounded figure 
is equal to y + 0.5 if y is positive, and y - 0.5 if y is negative. For 
example, 23.5% is rounded to 24%, and -23.5% is rounded to -24%.</p>

<p>Where percentages are rounded, they may not total 100% because they have been 
rounded independently.</p>

<h4>Use of symbols</h4>

<p>The following symbols have been used in the tables:</p>

<p><strong>z</strong> - Not applicable</p>

<p><strong>:</strong> - Not available</p>

<p><strong>0</strong> - Nil</p>

<h4>Using the data: pivot tables</h4>

<p>The detailed data tables MJ_D01 and MJ_D02 include pivot tables to allow 
users to select data for their needs.</p>

<p>The following instructions for use are included above the pivot table:</p>

<p>To rearrange the pivot tables, click on the data and a ‘PivotTable fields’ 
list will appear on the right of the screen. Drag and drop fields between the 
‘Filters’, ‘Columns’ and ‘Rows’ boxes to create a table that fits your 
requirements, for example move ‘Country of nationality’ to the ‘Rows’ box to 
obtain breakdowns by nationality.</p>

<p>Click the arrow button next to a field to apply a filter. This allows you to 
select a specific category - for example, to identify data for a specific 
year or specific nationality.</p>

<h4>Revisions to data</h4>

<p>The data contained in the report are revised every year. It is not possible 
to evaluate whether any future revisions will be upward or downward, however 
the reasons for revisions are likely to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late reporting of cases – a small proportion of cases are not included 
when the statistics are produced</li>
  <li>the results of data-cleansing exercises, such as data identified that 
cannot be included when the statistics are calculated because of missing or 
invalid values, or the identification of duplicates in the data</li>
  <li>new data added to the ISA system (for example from new grants of leave) 
can provide new information which allows linking of records which were 
previously unlinked</li>
</ul>

<h4>Factors affecting the statistics</h4>

<p>Immigration Rules are stated in ‘Statement of changes to the Immigration 
Rules’ HC395, which took effect from 1 October 1994. This consolidated 
previous rule changes, although there have been changes to the rules since 
1994. Some of these changes have affected the statistics and the most 
important changes are given in the ‘Policy and legislative changes timeline’ 
published alongside the quarterly immigration statistics.</p>

<h4>Strengths, limitations and data quality</h4>

<p>Below are some general strengths and limitations of the ‘Migrant Journey’.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths</strong> of the data provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very detailed information based on administrative sources providing exact 
counts by detailed nationality.</li>
  <li>Possible to see how changes to the UK’s immigration control system have 
directly impacted the numbers, which are used to directly monitor that system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limitations</strong> of the data provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data do not provide an indication of overall levels of immigration, 
emigration, and net migration.</li>
  <li>Data generally relate to those subject to immigration control and 
therefore cannot provide an overview of all immigration,</li>
  <li>Data do not provide information on emigration.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Official Statistics and National Statistics</h4>

<p>Official Statistics are data which are collected for the purpose of 
supporting government business and are drawn from the Home Office’s 
administrative systems. They have not necessarily been subject to the same 
detailed verification processes as those badged as NS. The data contained in 
the report are Official Statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Methodology</h2>

<h3>Change in methodology (including in previous editions)</h3>

<p>This report carries over the methodological changes that were introduced as 
part of the ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ visa and leave status: 2015’ 
report.</p>

<p>The methodology was enhanced in the ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ visa 
and leave status: 2015’ report. These reflected changes in the matching 
procedures adopted in linking together immigration histories. However, the 
numbers and messages in the data were broadly consistent with previous 
Migrant Journey analyses (up to and including the sixth report), with family 
and skilled work visas most likely to lead to settlement after 5 years, and 
study and temporary work routes less likely.</p>

<p>Previously matching was based on the internal links generated within the 
in-country casework system that is used to process application for leave from 
migrants already in the UK. Visa applications were matched to the in-country 
casework system. The linkage system was enhanced to also link together visas 
for a migrant, whether or not they have made an application for further leave 
while resident. Additionally, biometric information collected from 2008 
onwards is used to link visas and in-country leave, which further enhances 
the accuracy of the data matching.</p>

<p>An effect of the enhanced linking is that whenever a migrant applies for a 
visit visa and subsequently applies for a non-visit visa (e.g. to study) a 
link is made. Following the old methodology, this would mark a ‘journey’ as 
commencing with a visit visa (which could be a short holiday or preparatory 
visit) and not with the non-visit visa that actually granted residence. Given 
that visit visas do not confer residency rights (and their period of validity 
do not generally reflect periods of stay in the UK), visit visas were removed 
from the analysis in order to provide a better indication of the original 
purpose for entering the UK that might subsequently lead to residence.</p>

<p>The effect of the change in methodology is also to link up more periods of 
leave into ‘journeys’, particularly including linking periods of leave where 
a migrant has repeatedly applied for visas out of country rather than having 
requested any extensions of visas in country. This had a particular effect of 
boosting the percentages with valid leave after 5 years for those who 
originally arrived on work visas, which is not too surprising as one might 
expect a pattern of some visas being issued out of country for a specific 
spell of employment without subsequent extensions of leave in country being 
granted.</p>

<p>The new methodology generally indicates the same patterns but provides a 
better indication of the migrant status over time as it is based on better 
systems of data matching.</p>

<p>Although the new process was changed to exclude visitor arrivals, results 
from earlier sweeps of this study indicate that the percentage of those 
arriving on visit visas that were found to have valid leave 5 years later was 
very low.</p>

<p>In line with the change in method that excluded visit visas, the intention 
was to also exclude unsponsored Short-term study visas, this being a category 
that cannot be extended in-country and has similar characteristics to a visit 
visa (they normally have validity up to 6 months, though in some cases 11 
months). In generating figures for the ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ 
visa and leave status: 2016’ report it was discovered that inadvertently, in 
some years, a small number of grants Short-term study visas had been included 
in the published analysis. This did not have any significant impact on 
results and these have since been excluded from later reports.</p>

<h3>Change in methodology for categorising work leave</h3>

<p>Reports in this series, prior to the ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ visa 
and leave status: 2016’ report, have classified work categories as ‘Skilled 
work (with a potential path to settlement)’ or ‘Work (not leading to 
settlement)’.</p>

<p>Until April 2010, most High value and Skilled workers were eligible for 
settlement after five years in the UK. Persons entering under the UK Ancestry 
or Domestic Workers routes were also able to apply for settlement after five 
years working in the UK.</p>

<p>Changes to the Immigration Rules starting from April 2010 have removed the 
settlement rights for some Tier 2 migrants, domestic workers, and private 
servants in diplomatic households who come under the Tier 5 Temporary worker 
– international agreement category. Similarly, prior to the introduction of 
the PBS with shorter visas, many high-skilled workers obtained 5-year visas 
and therefore had a direct route to settlement without the need to obtain 
in-country extensions.</p>

<p>In light of these changes, which significantly altered the nature of migrants 
‘with a potential path to settlement’, and for greater consistency with 
quarterly Immigration Statistics, the classifications used in this report 
(and the previous one, ‘Statistics on changes in migrants’ visa and leave 
status: 2015’) for those granted Work visas now provide a closer alignment to 
the more clearly defined Work categoriesused in the published Immigration 
Statistics series.</p>

<p>However, it should also be recognised that Tiers did change over time. For 
example, various Tier 1 routes were closed and replaced by non-PBS work 
categories.</p>

<h3>Data source</h3>

<p>The statistics were extracted from the Initial Status Analysis (ISA) system, 
which was developed by the Exit Checks programme. The ISA system is a 
database that combines data from multiple Home Office systems, it links these 
data to produce individuals’ travel histories together with their immigration 
status.</p>

<p>For the Migrant Journey report, an extract is taken from the ISA comprising 
data from two of these systems:</p>

<p><strong>Case Information Database (CID)</strong> – data on extensions of stay within the UK.</p>

<p>CID was introduced in 2000 as the Asylum Case Information Database (ACID). It 
was then expanded in 2002 to cover non-asylum extensions of stay, settlement 
and British citizenship casework. Finally, systems dealing with port and 
enforcement casework were added in 2003. No records of migrants issued an 
extension of stay in the UK before 2000 were transferred to the CID. This 
means that the database did not contain complete case histories until 2004, 
and hence this is the earliest point for which the analysis in this report 
could be undertaken.</p>

<p><strong>Central Reference System (CRS)</strong> – data on grants of entry clearance (visas 
issued).</p>

<p>CRS was introduced in 2002 and is used to collect details of entry clearance 
applications in diplomatic missions abroad.</p>

<p><strong>Atlas</strong> – data on grant of entry clearance (visas issued) and extensions of 
stay within in the UK</p>

<p>Atlas was introduced in 2018 to replace existing caseworking systems for both 
overseas and in-country applications. Since then, casework has been 
transferred in blocks from other systems. Data from Atlas is included from 
the 2021 Migrant Journey report following its ingestion into ISA.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>The report includes two types of analyses, from the two detailed data tables 
and corresponding summary tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Migrants granted initial leave in five and ten years earlier, and 
examining their leave status at the end of the most recent year (table 
MJ_D01), by age and sex (tables MJ_01 to MJ_04)</li>
  <li>Migrants granted settlement in the most recent year and which leave they 
initially came to the UK with (table MJ_D02), by age and sex (tables MJ_05 
and MJ_06)</li>
</ul>

<p>In releases prior to the 2019 report, these were known as the ‘forward’ and 
‘backward’ analyses. This release does not use this terminology, but the 
analysis remains the same.</p>

<p><strong>Migrants granted an initial Study visa in five and ten years ago, and 
examining their leave status at the end of the most recent year</strong></p>

<p>This analysis looks at the cohorts of migrants granted initial leave five and 
ten years before the report and examining their immigration statuses at the 
end of the most recent year to identify whether they had valid permission to 
remain in the UK or whether they had changed their category of leave. It 
should be noted that valid leave does not confirm that a migrant is still in 
the UK at that point, as it is possible that they may have left prior to 
their leave expiring. Where a migrant has expired leave there are four 
possible outcomes, which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the migrant has left the UK</li>
  <li>the migrant is still in the UK (as an overstayer)</li>
  <li>the migrant has made an application for further leave to remain (LTR) that 
has not yet been processed, although for the period covered here the number 
in this final category will be small</li>
  <li>the migrant never travelled to the UK (the visa was not used)</li>
</ul>

<p>The published detailed data tables also contain information on migrants 
granted entry clearance in all years from 2004 to 2020. The summary tables 
focus on 2020 and 2015 only.</p>

<p><strong>Migrants granted settlement in the most recent year and which leave 
categories they used initially came to the UK on</strong></p>

<p>This analysis reports on cohorts of migrants granted settlement in the most 
recent year, tracing their records back through the immigration system to 
identify their initial entry clearance route and year of entry. The data 
provide information on migrants from the point they received clearance to 
enter the UK, until they leave the immigration system or are granted 
settlement.</p>

<p>The published data tables also contain information on migrants granted 
settlement in all years from 2009 to 2020.</p>

<p>Migration to the UK via non-visit visa routes is mainly managed through the 
PBS – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#glossary-of-terms">Glossary of terms</a>.</p>

<p>The underlying data used to calculate the number of migrants granted 
settlement is derived from a different administrative source than the 
published settlement figures in the quarterly ‘Immigration Statistics’ 
release, so figures are not identical. This is thought to largely relate to 
small number of cases for immediate settlement being derived from visa data 
as opposed to admissions data, with the latter being lower.</p>

<h3>Background and changes in legislation and policy affecting the statistics</h3>

<p>The PBS was introduced in 2008 and consists of five ‘tiers’. Three of these 
(Tiers 1, 2 and 5) relate to permission to work. Tier 1 provided a route for 
high-value workers; its phased implementation took place between February 
2008 and June 2008, replacing the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP), 
which also led to settlement. Subsequent changes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tier 1 General route was closed to new ‘out-of-country’ entry clearance 
visa applicants from 23 December 2010 and to those applying inside the UK to 
switch from most categories from 6 April 2011</li>
  <li>a new Tier 1 route (Exceptional Talent) was introduced from 9 August 2011</li>
  <li>Tier 1 Post-study route was closed to new applicants from 6 April 2012</li>
  <li>a new Tier 1 Graduate entrepreneur category was introduced from 6 April 2012</li>
  <li>The Tier 1 Entrepreneur route was closed to most new applicants in March 
2019 and replaced by the non-PBS Innovator route.</li>
  <li>The Tier 1 Graduate Entrepreneur route was closed to new applicants in 
July 2019 and replaced by the non-PBS Start-up route.</li>
  <li>The Tier 1 Exceptional Talent route was closed to new applicants in 
February 2020 and replaced by the non-PBS Global Talent route</li>
</ul>

<p>Tiers 2 and 5 were implemented in November 2008. Tier 2 replaced the Work 
Permit scheme and provided a route for skilled non-EEA nationals with 
sponsorship from a UK employer to come to live and work in the UK. The Work 
Permit scheme granted skilled migrants LTR in the UK in order to work in a 
skilled occupation. Tier 5 is for temporary workers and youth mobility, 
providing a route for those coming to the UK for primarily non-economic 
reasons. The additional tier (Tier 3) relates to unskilled workers and has 
never been implemented.</p>

<p>From 6 April 2012, Tier 2 skilled workers were allowed to stay in the UK for 
a maximum of 6 years if they are not granted permission to stay in the UK 
permanently. After 6 years they will have to depart the UK or switch into a 
different category. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791035/Tier_2_Policy_Guidance_03_2019.pdf" rel="external">Tier 2 policy guidance</a> 
states that those who depart the UK will not normally be able to reapply to 
return to the UK under Tier 2 for 12 months.</p>

<p>Tier 4 was implemented in March 2009 and provided a route for students to 
study with an approved education provider. Subsequent changes include a limit 
to the overall time that can be spent on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa">student visa</a>.</p>

<p>The Tier 4 Doctorate Extension was introduced on 6 April 2013.</p>

<p>Other non-visit visa categories outside of the PBS allow migrants to come to 
the UK for family reunion (through marriage and migration of dependent 
children) or to obtain settlement (indefinite LTR).</p>

<p>In this analysis, the ‘family route’ is made up of those coming to join or 
accompany family members who are British citizens or settled people. This 
includes fiancé(e)s, proposed civil partners, spouses, civil partners, or 
unmarried or same-sex partners, children and elderly relatives. Data from 
2012 also include those seeking to enter or remain in the UK on the basis of 
their family life with a person with limited leave as a refugee or person 
granted humanitarian protection (and the applicant cannot seek leave to enter 
or remain in the UK as their family member under Part 11 of the Immigration 
Rules).</p>

<p>Following a consultation on family migration, a number of changes to the 
Immigration Rules came into effect on 9 July 2012. The changes included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduction of a maintenance and accommodation threshold of £18,600 (with 
higher levels for also sponsoring non-EEA dependent children)</li>
  <li>extending from 2 years to 5 years the minimum probationary period before 
non-EEA spouses and partners can apply for settlement in the UK</li>
  <li>abolishing immediate settlement for the migrant spouses and partner where 
a couple have been living together overseas for at least 4 years, and 
requiring them to complete a 5-year probationary period</li>
  <li>introduction of a genuineness test for relationships</li>
  <li>allowing adult and elderly dependants to settle in the UK only where they 
can demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they 
require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided by a 
relative in the UK, and requiring them to apply from overseas rather than 
switch in the UK from another category, for example as a visitor</li>
</ul>

<p>The new Immigration Rules also balance the rights of the individual with the 
public interest in controlling immigration and protecting the public, with 
requirements defining the basis on which a person can enter or remain in the 
UK on the basis of their family or private life.</p>

<p>It is not possible to separately identify migrants issued a visa under the 
family Immigration Rules implemented on 9 July 2012.</p>

<p>The ‘asylum route’ is another way that migrants can enter the UK and achieve 
settlement. The number of settlement grants issued to migrants granted asylum 
fell from 67,810 in 2005 to 30,655 in 2006. By the end of 2009, there were 
3,110 migrants granted settlement in the asylum route. This decrease is 
partly due to changes to asylum policy in 2005. Prior to August 2005, those 
granted asylum were immediately entitled settlement. Migrants who are granted 
asylum after that date are entitled to receive 5 years’ temporary permission 
to stay after which they can apply for settlement. However, a large part of 
the decrease in asylum cases leading to settlement is due to the fall in 
numbers of people seeking and being granted asylum during this period. In 
2009, there were 24,487 asylum applications from main applicants, compared 
with a peak of 84,132 in 2002.</p>

<h3>Data matching</h3>

<p>For the purposes of the report, each migrant’s journey through the 
immigration system was tracked from the original leave category granted to 
them, through all the grants of entry clearance visas or extensions of stay 
and settlement records on the Home Office databases. The data collected for 
each migrant consisted of the type of leave granted (‘route’), the issue date 
and the expiry date. These details were put in chronological order using the 
issue date, with the type of leave granted (usually a visa) denoting the 
initial route of entry. This chronological ordering showed when and how each 
individual entered the immigration system, and the date of expiry of their 
last recorded extension or change of leave.</p>

<p>There are a number of visas which act as a catch-all for dependants – these 
are included within ‘Dependants joining/accompanying’ visa endorsements. In 
previous reports these endorsements were mapped according to the immigration 
route of the next leave granted in the journey. Where there was no grant of 
further leave in the journey, a default mapping of ‘Family’ was applied. To 
improve the alignment of the analysis with other immigration publications, 
this was changed for the ‘Fifth Migrant Journey’ report, so that endorsements 
are now shown as a separate category ‘Dependant joining or accompanying’ 
rather than mapped according to the immigration route of the next grant of 
leave in the journey. If the elapsed time between consecutive visas is longer 
than 12 months, the journey is separated into two separate journeys.</p>

<p>Dependants joining or accompanying are dependants who have been issued a visa 
on the basis of their relationship with another migrant, who is not a settled 
person or British citizen and may have been issued a visa for any reason 
(e.g. work, study, family, etc). Dependants are allocated an entry clearance 
category according to the circumstances of their application. Within the PBS, 
a child or partner will be recorded as a dependant under the tier of the main 
applicant, unless he/she has applied for and been granted a PBS visa in their 
own right, when they will be included as a main applicant. Outside of the 
PBS, many visas for dependants are specific to the visa for the main 
applicant. However, there are a number of visas which act as a catch-all for 
dependants who have been issued a visa on the basis of their relationship 
with another migrant, who is not a settled person or British citizen – these 
are included within ‘Dependants joining/accompanying’ and may have been 
issued a visa for any reason (e.g. work, study, family, etc).</p>
