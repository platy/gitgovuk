<p>If you’re hospitalised in Italy, we will try to contact you as soon as possible to see how we can help you. We will then aim to provide assistance according to your individual needs and vulnerability.</p>

<p>We can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visit you, particularly if you have no family or friends with you</li>
  <li>speak with doctors on your behalf if they do not speak English</li>
  <li>help you contact your insurance company</li>
  <li>contact your family or friends, if you’d like us to</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay your medical bills</li>
  <li>translate medical reports or diagnoses</li>
  <li>evaluate any treatment you have been given</li>
</ul>

<p>In deciding what kind of consular support would be most appropriate, we will take account of factors such as your condition, your ability to speak on the phone, whether you have relatives or friends with you, whether you have a tour company representative and the standard of medical facilities before deciding whether we should visit you. If we believe we should, and there is a British Embassy or Consulate in the same city as the hospital you are in, we will aim to visit you as soon as possible. We do not usually contact or visit people who have travelled specifically for medical treatment.</p>

<h2>Paying for your treatment</h2>

<h2>If you have a European Health Insurance Card or a Global Health Insurance Card issued by the UK</h2>

<p>The costs of Emergency care and hospital admission for necessary medical care are normally covered by your EHIC or GHIC if you are in an Italian state hospital.</p>

<p>If you are treated as an out-patient for follow-up checks you may need to pay fee, via a co-payment called ‘Ticket’, in the same way as an Italian resident, for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specialist referrals</li>
  <li>diagnostic tests</li>
  <li>prescription medicines</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are at a private hospital (clinica), your EHIC/GHIC may not be accepted, unless the private hospital has a special agreement (convenzione) with the public health authority. In this case you should contact your insurance company – see below.</p>

<p>The Embassy or Consulate cannot pay medical bills.</p>

<h2>If you do not have your EHIC or GHIC with you</h2>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" rel="external">Provisional Replacement Certificate (PRC)</a>  from the UK if you need treatment and you do not have your EHIC or GHIC, or your card is lost or stolen abroad.</p>

<p>You need to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/contact-us/overseas-healthcare-services-contact-us" rel="external">Overseas Healthcare Team</a>.</p>

<p>Telephone: 0300 330 1350</p>

<p>Outside UK: +44 191 283 3909</p>

<p>Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm and on Saturday, 9am to 3pm (UK time)</p>

<h2>Contact your insurance company</h2>

<p>Your EHIC or GHIC is not a substitute for travel insurance. It may not cover all health costs and never covers repatriation costs. Make sure you have travel insurance as well as your card.</p>

<p>If you have travel insurance, you or your family should contact your insurance company immediately.</p>

<p>We can help liaise between your insurance company and the Italian doctors but it’s important your insurance company is involved straight away.</p>

<p>You should also contact your GP in the UK, as your insurance company may want to speak to them as well.</p>

<p>Your insurance company may not accept your claim if you didn’t disclose a previous condition.</p>

<p>Remember to keep any receipts or doctors’ notes in case you need them to make a claim.</p>

<h2>Hospital admission</h2>

<p>Emergency admissions to hospital occur via A&amp;E (Pronto Soccorso). You’ll generally be pre-assessed on arrival by a nurse or doctor before further actions are taken and you are assigned a colour-coded category, based on the level of severity of your condition: Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, White. This is called triage.</p>

<p>Waiting times will depend on the category you are assigned. White categories, which are considered as not requiring urgent treatment, will need to pay a fee.</p>

<h2>While you’re in hospital</h2>

<p>As a patient, you will need to bring everything you need with you, including towels, toiletries etc, which can also be provided for you by family or friends once admitted.</p>

<p>Meals are provided free of charge. Patients are normally served three meals a day (breakfast, lunch and supper) but menus and patterns may vary according to your medical condition.</p>

<p>Wards usually have 3 to 6 beds – if you want a single room, you may need to pay for it or go to a private hospital. Laundry service for personal clothing is not normally provided and patients are expected to have an adequate change of clothes. In some hospitals, you can find volunteers from local charities to help.</p>

<p>Most hospitals have social workers who can help you. Ask to speak to a social worker (assistente sociale) through the hospital medical staff or the hospital’s customer services office (Ufficio Relazione con il Pubblico).</p>

<p>Hospitals are required to publish a Charter of Services, in Italian (Carta dei Servizi), also available on the hospital website, which provides general information about their services. Different wards often have different visiting times and regulations.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals’ visiting arrangements have been subject to further restrictions.  Check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/coronavirus">Italy Travel Advice</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Making a complaint</h2>

<p>If you’re not happy with the care you’re receiving, you can make a complaint with the hospital’s customer services office (Ufficio Relazioni per il Pubblico-URP).</p>

<p>A complaint can usually be filed in person, on the phone or in writing. Larger hospitals publish templates on their websites.</p>

<p>For more serious complaints, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-list-of-lawyers">seek legal advice from an English-speaking lawyer in Italy</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.cittadinanzattiva.it/files/corporate/europa/carta/European_Charter_of_Patients_Rights_england.pdf" rel="external">European Charter of Patients’ Rights</a> explains your rights.</p>

<h2>Before you leave hospital</h2>

<p>When you’re discharged, you’ll receive a letter in Italian outlining your diagnosis and any medication prescribed. Make sure you provide the details of your EHIC/GHIC or Provision Replacement Certificate to the hospital Administration office (Ufficio Amministrazione or Ufficio Stranieri) before you leave the hospital to avoid receiving an unexpected medical bill.</p>

<h2>Full medical report</h2>

<p>If you want a full medical report (cartella clinica), you’ll need to make an official request to the Ufficio Cartelle Cliniche. Information on how to apply is normally available on the hospital website or you can ask hospital staff.</p>

<p>Application procedures vary in each hospital. In some instances it might not be possible to send online payments or have your medical records couriered abroad.</p>

<h2>Fit-to-fly certificate</h2>

<p>Your airline may require a fit-to-fly certificate, so check with them before you’re discharged. Public hospitals normally do not provide this certificate so you might need to make private arrangements via your insurance company or contact a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/italy-list-of-medical-facilitiespractitioners/list-of-english-speaking-doctors-in-italy">private healthcare provider</a>.</p>

<h2>Repatriation</h2>

<p>If you have travel insurance and your claim has been accepted, your insurance company will organise your return to the UK.</p>

<p>However, if you don’t have insurance or a valid claim, and you’re not well enough to travel on a public flight, you’ll need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medical-repatriation-companies-in-the-uk--2">contact a private repatriation company</a>. Be aware, they can be very expensive.</p>
