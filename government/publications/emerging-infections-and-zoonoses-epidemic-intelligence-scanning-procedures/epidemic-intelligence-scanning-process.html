<h2>Epidemic intelligence activities</h2>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency’s (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (<abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr>) team gathers information about outbreaks and incidents of new and emerging infectious diseases through their Epidemic Intelligence (<abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr>) process. Timely detection of public health threats is critical to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s and the UK government’s responses to threats that may affect the UK public, as well as raising awareness of incidents occurring globally.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> process is comprised of 3 distinct steps: <a class="govuk-link" href="#detection">detection</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#assessment">assessment</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#communication-and-outputs">communication</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>  Detection</h2>

<p><abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> processes are undertaken each weekday by specialised scientists in the <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team. Signals are predominantly detected using the World Health Organization’s (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/eios" rel="external">Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources</a> (<abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources">EIOS</abbr>) platform. The <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources">EIOS</abbr> platform collates thousands of articles daily from a broad range of publicly available sources including media, government and ministry of health websites and news aggregators.</p>

<p>As articles are imported into the platform, they are automatically translated and categorised into disease topic areas. The way <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources">EIOS</abbr> organises the articles, which are continuously imported into the platform, enables the <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team to process a large amount of information each day. In addition, the <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team scan approximately 50 sources outside of the <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources">EIOS</abbr> platform, to maximise signal detection coverage.</p>

<p>The aim of the <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> process is to identify any new or updated information about outbreaks and incidents involving emerging infectious diseases which might pose a threat to the UK population. Epidemiological data on other outbreaks of public health significance is also gathered for situational awareness about incidents occurring globally.</p>

<p>Relevant events include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the identification of a new or emerging infectious agent</li>
  <li>undiagnosed morbidity or mortality events with a potentially infectious disease aetiology</li>
  <li>a new incident of epidemic potential either internationally or in a UK context</li>
  <li>identification of a new aetiological agent of a known disease or syndrome</li>
  <li>zoonotic or possible zoonotic outbreaks</li>
  <li>new or updated national or international infectious disease guidance</li>
  <li>bioterrorism incidents or potential deliberate release of biological agents</li>
  <li>scientific journal articles and pre-prints about new and/or emerging infectious diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>The information sources included are regularly reviewed and updated in line with specific incidents being monitored. For example, local media sources may be checked for updates relating to outbreaks occurring in a specific geographical area. Where possible, official sources of information are sought to verify signals.</p>

<p>All relevant information is recorded in a dedicated <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> database, which includes details on the date and source of the report, a description of the incident, its geographical location, and an <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> confidence rating (which depends on the source of the information). Subsequent reports with any new information are also recorded.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>  Assessment</h2>

<p>The public health significance of newly detected incidents is determined using criteria including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the event is unusual or unexpected?</li>
  <li>are there unexpectedly high rates of illness or death?</li>
  <li>is it likely to have a serious health impact?</li>
  <li>is there a potential for spread beyond national borders?</li>
  <li>is there a potential for interference with international travel or trade?</li>
  <li>is there local or national capacity to contain the outbreak?</li>
  <li>is the incident suspected to be due to deliberate release?</li>
</ul>

<p>Incidents which do not meet one (or more) of the above criteria may still be monitored for situational awareness.</p>

<p>Reports of undiagnosed morbidity or mortality events are also identified during <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> activities. Due to delays in confirmatory laboratory diagnostics, disease outbreaks may initially be reported as undiagnosed morbidity and mortality events where an infectious agent is suspected but the aetiology is unknown at the time of the initial report.</p>

<p>Previous outbreaks of major public health significance (including COVID-19, Ebola virus disease in West Africa, and Zika virus in the Americas) have been reported in the early stages as undiagnosed morbidity or mortality events. This highlights the importance of monitoring and detecting early reports of disease outbreaks. Reports of such events are logged, assessed, and closely monitored. Events that may be of greater concern are escalated appropriately within <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and to UK government.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1&nbsp;Risk </span> assessments</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team produce assessments to determine the risk an outbreak of a disease poses to the UK public, UK interests overseas, and other populations. Risk assessments are disseminated within&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, across UK government, and to the UK devolved administrations.</p>

<p>Probability and impact assessments, in addition to expert opinion, are used to inform the risk assessments. The probability of introduction of a pathogen into the UK population depends on the availability of routes of introduction into the UK, the likelihood of exposure, population susceptibility, and transmission mechanisms.</p>

<p>The impact of an infection depends on the severity of disease in the population, the number of people affected, and the availability of interventions (for example, available treatments or control measures).</p>

<p>When probability and impact assessments have been completed, these can be combined to determine the overall risk level to the population in question.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Communication and outputs</h2>

<p>Information gathered through <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> informs various routine and reactive outputs. If an incident is deemed to be of public health importance, it is reported to relevant groups and individuals both within&nbsp;<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>&nbsp;and across UK government, as required depending on the risk identified. The <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team also share and receive <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> from their international networks.</p>

<p>Uses of information gathered are outlined below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1&nbsp;Guidance </span> and incident response</h3>

<p><abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> gathered by the <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team is used to inform relevant public health guidance and maintain up to date disease specific webpages on gov.uk (for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ebola-virus-disease-clinical-management-and-guidance">Ebola clinical management and guidance collection</a>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> is also used for international situational awareness during <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>’s responses to outbreaks, for example the multi-country monkeypox outbreak in 2022.</p>

<h3><span class="number">3.2&nbsp;Reports </span></h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emerging-infections-monthly-summaries">emerging infections monthly summary</a> provides information about significant outbreaks of new and emerging infectious diseases globally, identified through the <abbr title="Emerging Infections and Zoonoses">EIZ</abbr> team’s <abbr title="Epidemic Intelligence">EI</abbr> activities. The report includes a section on new scientific publications of relevance to emerging infections and information about any reports of novel pathogens and diseases identified.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-consequence-infectious-diseases-monthly-summaries">high consequence infectious diseases (<abbr title="High Consequence Infectious Diseases">HCID</abbr>) monthly report</a> summarises information about cases and outbreaks of <abbr title="High Consequence Infectious Diseases">HCIDs</abbr> reported globally. The report is publicly available and aims to inform healthcare professionals that may be involved in the identification of <abbr title="High Consequence Infectious Diseases">HCIDs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3&nbsp;Informal </span> communications</h3>

<p>Information is informally communicated with colleagues within <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and from other UK Government departments on request, and reports on particular international incidents are produced as required.</p>
