</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> operational level agreements (<abbr title="operational level agreements">OLAs</abbr>) outline standards for good practice for all users of the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> and are designed to promote the achievement of these objectives.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> <abbr title="operational level agreements">OLAs</abbr> are published in separate documents for different groups of users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part A: maternity users</li>
  <li>part B: child health record department users</li>
  <li>part C: newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) screening laboratory users</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Maternity Users, including neonatal unit (NNU)/special care baby unit (SCBU)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A1: daily checking of the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Statement: the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking screen must be checked daily to detect in a timely way babies who may have missed screening.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: the tracking screen must be checked daily as part of the mandatory requirement to use the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Appropriate action must be taken, daily, on records appearing on the tracking screen. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading or adding notes</li>
  <li>updating status</li>
  <li>making enquiries</li>
  <li>communicating with members of the midwifery team, <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> or <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening labs</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A2: transfer, and acceptance of transfer, of <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> records</h3>

<p>Statement: <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> records which need transferring to another maternity unit must be transferred and accepted promptly to make sure that babies who may have missed screening can be followed up with minimal delay.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: records which need to be transferred to another maternity unit on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> must be transferred out as soon as the need to transfer is identified. This should normally be the same day that the record appears on the tracking page.</p>

<p>When a ‘transfer in’ appears on the tracking page, the record must be accepted or rejected as soon as possible. This should normally be the same day that the record appears as a ‘transfer in’ on the tracking page.</p>

<p>When a ‘transfer in’ is rejected, an explanatory note must be added to the notes page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A3a: updating the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status of deceased babies</h3>

<p>Statement: the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status must be updated when a baby dies to avoid inappropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening contact with the family.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> records must be updated for unscreened deceased babies to avoid the possibility of a request for a screening test or repeat request appearing on the maternity site tracking page. If newborn screening has been completed it is not necessary to update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record, but the user can do so if they wish.</p>

<p>When notified of the death maternity users must locate the baby’s <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record using the search function. The status must then be updated to ‘deceased’, and notes added to indicate the source of the information.</p>

<p>As well as changing the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example, by telephone or email.</p>

<p>Note: where possible, users should encourage local units which manage neonates to make sure that their end-of-life checklist or protocol includes contacting the local <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> administrator when a baby dies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A3b: confirming deceased status after sample has been received and processed by laboratory</h3>

<p>In the rare instance that a blood spot sample is received in the laboratory for a deceased baby, for example the baby died after the date the sample was taken, the laboratory will process the sample and upload results to <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>. The deceased baby’s record will appear on the tracking page with the text ‘deceased confirmation required’.</p>

<p>By clicking on ‘deceased confirmation required’, users will be able to confirm the deceased status (by clicking the ‘confirm deceased’ button) or update the status (by clicking the ‘update’ button) and add notes to indicate the source of the information. You may have to contact another maternity provider or <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> to find out the information you need to confirm the baby’s deceased status. You can use the contacts database under the resources tab on failsafe to retrieve the contacts for other maternity sites or <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> users when trying to confirm baby’s deceased status. If you require support with this, please <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NBSFS.helpdesk@nhs.net">contact <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status must be checked and updated when a baby with a ‘deceased’ status has a sample taken after the date of supposed death to avoid inappropriate contact with the family.</p>

<p>As well as updating the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A4: updating the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record of babies living at a different address to the mother (for example in foster care)</h3>

<p>Statement: The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> details must be updated when a baby is at a different address to the mother to avoid delays in locating the baby and to avoid inappropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening contact with the birth family.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: as soon as possible after being notified that the mother and baby are at different addresses, the maternity user must update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system using the ‘discharge/latest baby address’ field, confirming that the mother and baby are at different locations and adding relevant notes.</p>

<p>As well as changing the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example by telephone or email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A5: managing status and demographic changes on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Statement: the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record should be updated when status and demographic changes are identified to ensure records are current and accurate.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: the following changes should be made to records for babies who have not completed <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening, as soon as possible, which may be before the records flag up on the tracking page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deceased baby (see section <abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A3)</li>
  <li>mother and baby at a different address (see section <abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A4)</li>
  <li>baby’s NHS number or date of birth, and tell the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk (see contact details below) as this may affect matching the card with the record</li>

<p>If newborn screening has been completed it is not necessary to update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record, but the user can do so if they wish.</p>

<p>The following changes only need to be made to records which flag up on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any other demographic changes for mother or baby including name, address, baby’s birth weight, gestational age or birth order</li>
  <li>any other change of status including <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening declined, mother cannot be located, or moved out of England</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as changing the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example by telephone or email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A6: maintaining continuity of service — regular user away</h3>

<p>Statement: When the regular user is away, on planned or unplanned leave, a substitute is appointed to take on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: so that the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> is checked daily, there must be cover when the regular user is away, by another authorised and competent <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> user. Ideally cover should be planned and handover given, but the user’s manager should be aware of the user’s <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities and have arrangements in place for a substitute if leave is unplanned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A7: maintaining continuity of service for new users</h3>

<p>Statement: When the regular user leaves or changes role, a successor is appointed to take on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> site lead should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#NBSFS-helpdesk"><abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk</a> to terminate the access for the current user and arrange access for the new user. If the user leaving is the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> site lead, the current site lead should, where possible, contact the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk with details of the new site lead, prior to their departure.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A8: management of <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> when an unscreened baby exceeds the age for maternity responsibility</h3>

<p>Statement: The maternity service is normally responsible for completing <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening. There are, however, occasions when health visitors (who do not have access to <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>) take over this role. This <abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> is intended to explain how to manage <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> in this event.</p>

<p>The age at which maternity services are no longer responsible for <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening varies from area to area, as does the referral pathway. Note: This <abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> does not change existing local policies.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: the screening midwife or local coordinating officer (LCO) responsible for <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> must ensure that the health visitor who is taking over responsibility for the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> test is aware of the outstanding test, as per local policy. This contact may be made via the <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> depending on local policy.</p>

<p>The screening midwife or LCO may wish to make the health visitor aware that the record is appearing on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page and request that they maintain communication if delays to screening continue.</p>

<p>A note should be made in the ‘notes’ section of the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> regarding the contact with the health visitor, preferably giving reasons for the delay.</p>

<p>No attempt should be made to have the record removed from the tracking page if screening is not completed.</p>

<p>If a record remains for an undue period of time, the matter should be escalated via the <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> (see <abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> A10).</p>

<p>Note: if the mother or carer has declined the test or cannot be contacted/located (in accordance with local policies), the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening laboratory should be contacted to assign the appropriate status code to the record. The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status can also be updated to reflect this, ensuring that relevant notes are added to the system.</p>

  <li>that are over 25 days of age and a repeat sample is required (this will trigger an alert to regional QA)</li>
  <li>that are over 40 days of age and a repeat sample is required (this will trigger an alert to regional QA)</li>
  <li>for whom the lab has not received a blood spot card</li>
  <li>that are in a ‘transfer in’ state (system users will need to accept or reject these records that have been transferred in from another maternity site)</li>
  <li>that are in a ‘transfer out’ state (system users, at the site to which these records have be transferred out to, will have to accept or reject these records)</li>
</ul>

<p>Weekly reports are particularly helpful for identifying trends, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an increasing trend in avoidable repeats could indicate blood spot quality training needs</li>
  <li>an increasing trend in amber and red flagged records could indicate postal delays and may warrant further investigation to identify where the delays in the sample transport pathway and/or implementing courier or special delivery service over bank holidays periods</li>
</ul>
