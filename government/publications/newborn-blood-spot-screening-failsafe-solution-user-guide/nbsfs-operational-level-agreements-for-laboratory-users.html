<h3>
<span class="number">1.19 </span>Changes to laboratory information management system (<abbr title="laboratory information management system">LIMS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Before any significant change to their <abbr title="laboratory information management system">LIMS</abbr>, laboratories should contact Northgate Public Service (<abbr title="Northgate Public Service">NPS</abbr>) to arrange a discussion about the implications for the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>. This should be done via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-level-agreements-for-laboratory-users#nbsfs-helpdesk"><abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk</a>. This discussion will help to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the extent of testing needed before uploading results from the new or updated <abbr title="laboratory information management system">LIMS</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if any assistance is needed from the <abbr title="laboratory information management system">LIMS</abbr> provider and <abbr title="Northgate Public Service">NPS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically this discussion will involve informing <abbr title="Northgate Public Service">NPS</abbr> of any changes to Comma Separated Values (CSV) files. You should tell them which fields have been extracted, or any changes you have made to the number of files expected per day (for example, separate or combined files for ‘01’, and results message).</p>

<p>Laboratories must ensure they carry out appropriate testing of receipt and reporting of results, partial results (‘n’ conditions) if applicable, and re-reporting. The testing strategy should ensure all available Newborn Blood Spot status codes and sub-codes are tested and verified.</p>

<p><abbr title="Northgate Public Service">NPS</abbr> will support each laboratory’s own testing activity by making available a test system in to which laboratories can either manually upload test files into the failsafe or can utilise the test version of the automated upload process.</p>
