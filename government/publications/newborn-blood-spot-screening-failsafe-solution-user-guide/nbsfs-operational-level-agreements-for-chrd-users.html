<p>The use of the national Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution (<abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>) is mandated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/public-health-national-service-specifications" rel="external">service specification No. 19, NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening 2018/19</a> in sections 2.2, 2.3, 3.6, 3.25, 4.2 and 5.6.</p>

<p>The regular and correct use of <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> promotes the achievements of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-population-screening-programme-standards#newborn-blood-spot-(nbs)">nationally agreed standards for Newborn Blood Spot Screening</a>, in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard 1a: coverage (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Group">CCG</abbr> responsibility at birth)</li>
  <li>standard 2: timely identification of babies with a null or incomplete result recorded on the child health information system</li>
  <li>standard 4: timely sample collection</li>
  <li>standard 5: timely receipt of a sample into the newborn screening laboratory</li>

  <li>standard 9: timely processing of CHT and IMD (excluding HCU) screen positive samples</li>
  <li>standard 11: timely entry into clinical care</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> operational level agreements (<abbr title="operational level agreements">OLAs</abbr>) outline standards for good practice for all users of the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> and are designed to promote the achievement of these objectives.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> <abbr title="operational level agreements">OLAs</abbr> are published in separate documents for different groups of user:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part A: maternity users</li>
  <li>part B: child health record department users</li>
  <li>part C: newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) screening laboratory users</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Terminology</h2>

<p>‘Daily’ denotes Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays.</p>

<p>‘Maternity user’ applies to all users who access the maternity <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> including those working in maternity hospitals, community midwifery units, neonatal units and special care baby units.</p>

<p>‘Child Health Record Department (<abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr>) user’ applies to all users who access the <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>‘Laboratory user’ applies to all users who access the laboratory <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>, including clinical scientists and administrators.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Child health record department users</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B1: daily checking of the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Statement: The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking screen should be checked daily to detect in a timely way babies who may have missed screening.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: It is recommended that the tracking screen is checked daily by <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> users.</p>

<p>Appropriate action should be taken daily on records appearing on the tracking screen, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading or adding notes</li>
  <li>cross checking other data sources</li>
  <li>making enquiries</li>
  <li>communicating with members of the midwifery team, HV team or <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening labs</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> should remain as a failsafe for <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> users, in other words as a secondary checking system to other sources of <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening information such as laboratory communications or CHIS records.</p>

<p>The data is provided to support failsafe processes, such as identifying the type of repeat required. It is not intended for populating patient or child health records or giving results to parents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B2a: updating the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status of deceased babies</h3>

<p>Statement: The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status must be updated when a baby dies to avoid inappropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening contact with the family.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> records must be updated for un-screened deceased babies to avoid the possibility of a request for a screening test or repeat request appearing on the maternity site tracking page. If newborn screening has been completed, it is not necessary to update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record, but the user can do so if they wish.</p>

<p>When notified of the death, maternity users must locate the baby’s <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record using the search function. The status must then be updated to ‘deceased’, and notes added to indicate the source of the information.</p>

<p>As well as changing the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example by telephone or email.</p>

<p>Note: All CHRDs should ensure that the department’s end-of-life checklist/protocol includes contacting the relevant <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> administrator when a baby dies.</p>

<p>Where possible, users should encourage local units which manage neonates to make sure that their end-of-life checklist/protocol includes contacting the local <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> administrator when a baby dies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B2b: confirming deceased status after sample has been received and processed by laboratory</h3>

<p>In the rare instance that a blood spot sample is received in the laboratory for a deceased baby, for example the baby died after the date the sample was taken, the laboratory will process the sample and upload results to <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>. The deceased baby’s record will appear on the tracking page with the text ‘deceased confirmation required’.</p>

<p>By clicking on ‘deceased confirmation required’, users will be able to confirm the deceased status (by clicking the ‘confirm deceased’ button) or update the status (by clicking the ‘update’ button) and add notes to indicate the source of the information, for example notification from specialist neonate unit or <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> status must be checked and updated when a baby with a ‘deceased’ status has a sample taken after the date of supposed death to avoid inappropriate contact with the family.</p>

<p>As well as updating the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B3: updating the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record of babies living at a different address to the mother (for example, when they are in foster care)</h3>

<p>Statement: The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> details must be updated when a baby is at a different address to the mother to avoid delays in locating the baby and to avoid inappropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening contact with the birth family.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> users who are aware that a baby is at a different address to the mother should add a note to the system and communicate with the maternity user, requesting they update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system.</p>

<p>In addition to changing information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, all users should ensure that the updated information has been effectively communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example by telephone or email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B4: managing status and demographic changes on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Statement: The <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> record should be updated when status and demographic changes are identified to ensure records are current and accurate.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: <abbr title="Child Health Record Department">CHRD</abbr> users who are aware of a change in status or demographics should add a note to the system and communicate with the maternity user, requesting they update the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system.</p>

<p>As well as changing the information on the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, users should make sure the updated information has been communicated with all other relevant personnel as appropriate, for example by telephone or email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B5: maintaining continuity of service (regular user away)</h3>

<p>Statement: When the regular user is away, on planned or unplanned leave, a substitute is appointed to take on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: so that the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> is checked daily, there must be cover when the regular user is away, by another authorised and competent <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> user. Ideally cover should be planned and handover given, but the user’s manager should be aware of the user’s <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities and have arrangements in place for a substitute if leave is unplanned.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>
<abbr title="operational level agreement">OLA</abbr> B6: maintaining continuity of service — new users</h3>

<p>Statement: When the regular user leaves or changes role, a successor is appointed to take on <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<p>Responsibility of users: the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> site lead should contact the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk to terminate the access for the current user and arrange access for the new user. If the user leaving is the <abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> site lead, the current site lead should, where possible, contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#nbsfs-helpdesk"><abbr title="Newborn Blood Spot Failsafe Solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk</a> with details of the new site lead, prior to their departure.</p>
