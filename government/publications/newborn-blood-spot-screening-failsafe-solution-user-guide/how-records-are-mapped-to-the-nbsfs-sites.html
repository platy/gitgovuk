<p>Newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution (<abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>) records are mapped by the baby’s home address (<abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode).</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode cannot be used, the record is mapped to the hospital of birth organisation code (<abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr>).</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> cannot be used, the record is mapped to the child health unit based on the Registering Authority (<abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr>) code.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr> code cannot be used, the record moves to the ‘unmapped site’ and a manual process is undertaken by the system provider to place the record.</p>

<p>This can be summarised as below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Home address: <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode</li>
  <li>Hospital of birth: <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr>
</li>
  <li>Associated child health unit: <abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr> code</li>
  <li>Manual process: ‘unmapped site’</li>
</ol>

<h2>Details of each stage</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Home address</h3>

<p><abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> baby records are mapped to the site of the mother’s home address as this is most likely to be the site responsible for screening the baby.</p>

<p>This is based on the mother’s <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode provided in the data given when the NHS number is generated, usually by the labour ward midwife.</p>

<p>Usually, only the first part of the postcode is used (for example, PR4).</p>

<p>If the first part of the postcode is shared between more than one maternity site this can result in records being wrongly mapped.</p>

<p>A request can be made via the <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NBSFS.helpdesk@nhs.net"><abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk</a> and the postcode can be mapped by adding additional digits of the postcode, for example, PR4 4, PR4 4R, or even the full postcode PR4 4RT.</p>

<p>The decision to map by <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode is based on the premise that the vast majority of mother and babies will be back at their usual residence on day 5 of age. The coverage (<abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode) was decided by the local maternity service when <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> was implemented and is based on how the maternity service is organised in that area.</p>

<p>The list of <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> codes or postcodes was provided by the local maternity service when <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> was implemented and has sometimes been updated by them since.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Hospital of birth</h3>

<p>If the postcode is shared between more than one <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site, the record will be mapped to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site associated with the hospital of birth.</p>

<p>This is based on the <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> provided in the data given when the NHS number is generated, usually by the labour ward midwife.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> will also be used if the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode cannot be recognised in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system, for example, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an error has been made in the mother’s record</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> has a new code</li>
  <li>the mother has a <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> whose code is not registered on <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> (for example, because they are a private <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In many cases, the org code will successfully map the record to the maternity site responsible for the baby’s blood spot screening, as the hospital of birth and the hospital responsible for postnatal care are often the same.</p>

<p>If not, the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user should transfer the record to the correct <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site if the record flags on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Child Health Department</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode and the <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> cannot be used for mapping the record, it will be mapped to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site related to the child health unit based on the <abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr> code linked to the baby’s record.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> only appears in <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> for births which are recorded as an NHS hospital birth.</p>

<p>Other births, such as those recorded as home births, private births and those occurring on the way to hospital, do not have an <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> data for technical reasons currently beyond the control of the programme.</p>

<p>This means that home births and private births where the postcode/<abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code cannot be used for mapping (for example, because it is a shared postcode or private <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr>) will be mapped to the maternity site associated with the <abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr> code.</p>

<p>If this is not the maternity site responsible for the baby’s blood spot screening, the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user will need to transfer the record to the correct <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site if the record flags up on the tracking page.</p>

<p>Please note that maternity site users are responsible for the management of records on <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Unmapped site</h3>

<p>If the <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code or postcode, <abbr title="organisation code">Org code</abbr> and <abbr title="Registering Authority">RA</abbr> code cannot be used to map the record in <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>, the record is placed in the ‘unmapped site’.</p>

<p>This site is monitored by the system provider and the record will be manually transferred to the most appropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site, based on the data available in the record.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site must accept or reject the transfer as appropriate.</p>

<p>There is an escalation process to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> Programme team if an unmapped record cannot be placed.</p>
