<span class="number">1. </span>Added by an <abbr title="Newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user</h2>

<p>These are free text notes. To identify the user who added a note, hover the cursor over the user ID and their details will be shown.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Added by an adviser from the system supplier (Northgate Public Services)</h2>

<p>These are free text notes. The adviser’s name, with contact details, will be shown when the cursor is hovered over the user ID.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Automatic notes</h2>

<p>These are added automatically following specific actions and updates affecting a record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Explanation of terms</h3>

<p>Here is a list of the comments automatically added to the notes section, followed by an explanation for each term.</p>

<h4>Record for [NAME] baby created successfully</h4>

<p>This note is added when the <abbr title="Newborn blood spot screening failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> record is initially created.</p>

<h4>User Viewed Record</h4>

<p>A note is added to a record if it has been searched for and accessed (via National Search function) if it is outside a user’s cohort of responsibility. The note will include the user’s login name.</p>

<h4>Auto Matched</h4>

<p>A blood spot card has been automatically matched to this record because the key identifiers matched. The lab card serial number and lab name of the lab which uploaded the sample will also be displayed.</p>

<h4>Manual Matched</h4>

<p>A blood spot card has been matched to this record, but it was completed by a manual process because not all the key identifiers matched.</p>

<p>The lab card serial number and lab name of the lab which uploaded the sample will also be displayed.</p>

<h4>Auto Matched Manual Update Required</h4>

<p>A blood spot card has been automatically matched to this record because the key identifiers matched but will require manual validation (checking) by the screening lab. The reason for manual validation will be shown (see examples below).</p>

<h4>Manual Update Required</h4>

<p>This will require manual validation (checking) by the screening lab. The reason for manual validation will be shown (see examples below).</p>

<h4>Lab card placed in manual validation queue due to collection date being either null, earlier than, or equal to, an existing sample card’s collection date</h4>

<p>Manual validation is a laboratory process for checking results. In this case, a sample card has been received out of date order.</p>

<h4>Lab card placed in lab manual validation queue for review of test results</h4>

<p>Manual validation is a laboratory process for checking results. In this case, the results uploaded have flagged for review by the lab prior to being accepted or rejected.</p>

<h4>Lab card placed in lab manual validation queue as another sample card for this baby is awaiting manual validation</h4>

<p>Manual validation is a laboratory process for checking results. In this case, there is currently an earlier received sample card awaiting manual validation and therefore this sample is now queued awaiting validation.</p>

<h4>Lab card placed in lab manual validation queue due to the repeat reason being set to 0316 – CHT borderline result</h4>

<p>Manual validation is a laboratory process for checking results. In this case a subsequent card has been received after a borderline result for CHT received.</p>

<h4>Lab card placed in lab manual validation queue due to the repeat reason being set to 0317 – CF inconclusive</h4>

<p>Manual validation is a laboratory process for checking results. In this case a subsequent card has been received after a CF inconclusive result received.</p>

<h4>Manual validation all results accepted for lab serial no</h4>

<p>Manual validation results for lab serial no: XYZ supersede the previous results entered.</p>

<h4>Manual validation all results rejected for lab serial no</h4>

<p>Manual validation results for lab serial no: XYZ do not supersede the previous results entered.</p>

<h4>Manual validation results part accepted or rejected: lab serial no</h4>

<p>Manual validation results: some of the results for lab serial no: XYZ supersede the previous results entered.</p>

<h4>The baby’s status was changed to out of England</h4>

<p>Baby’s status has been changed to out of England. The notes will show if the record is set to RAF Lakenheath (US Air Force), Channel Islands, Northern Ireland, Scotland, moved to a non-UK country.</p>

<h4>The baby’s Deceased Status Confirmed</h4>

<p>Baby’s deceased status confirmed following receipt of result update after baby status changed to Deceased. In such circumstances baby will be flagged as Deceased with Results / Deceased confirmation required pending user update.</p>

<h4>The baby’s repeat reason was changed to multiple reasons – please see test results below</h4>

<p>This comment appears when there was more than one reason for a repeat. The reasons will be shown in the results section in the baby’s records.</p>

<h4>Sample and repeat request received for infant marked as old status – please follow up</h4>

<p>This comment appears if a sample is uploaded and matched to a record after it has already been marked as either ‘declined’ or ‘mother cannot be located’. The system is requesting that this is reviewed as it is not expecting a sample to be loaded or matched if a patient has either declined screening or the mother could not be located to screen the baby.</p>

<h4>Test results added manually: lab serial no</h4>

<p>This comment appears if the lab has updated the results for a baby’s record manually.</p>

<p>The following automated comments are self-explanatory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transferring from XXXX to YYYY</li>
  <li>baby transferred to XXXX</li>
