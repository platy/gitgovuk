<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Please note that quick reference guides with detailed step-by-step actions for system functions are available on the resources section in the newborn blood spot failsafe solution (<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Access the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The system is only available on an N3 connection (NHS secure). <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nww.bloodspot.northgate.thirdparty.nhs.uk/BloodspotWeb/nhsbaby" rel="external">Access the system</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> does not work with Internet Explorer (<abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>) versions older than <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 10. The system also works on the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> is an IT solution for England that reduces the risk of babies missing or having delayed newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) screening. It supports the maternity service responsibility for making sure <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening is offered and that samples are taken and received in the laboratory on time.</p>

<p>This is a summary of how the system works (see also diagram below).</p>

<ol>
  <li>The midwife completes the baby’s birth notification and an NHS number is automatically created via the Patient Demographic Service (<abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr>).</li>
  <li>This NHS number and some demographic data entered by the midwife are automatically uploaded from the <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr> into the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> database.</li>
  <li>A record for the baby is created in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. This is allocated to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site responsible for screening the baby, based on the mother’s postcode or <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code. For more details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/how-records-are-mapped-to-the-nbsfs-sites">mapping records to <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> sites</a>.</li>
  <li>The newborn blood spot (<abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr>) is taken, usually on day 5, and sent to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening laboratory.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening laboratory tests the blood spot card.</li>
  <li>The laboratory uploads the outcome – for example, ‘repeat required’ or screening results (not suspected, suspected) – into the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</li>
  <li>On day 12 of age, records flag up amber on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page of the relevant <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site if no <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> card has been received for a record, or if a repeat is required. Each maternity site has designated users who log into the system each working day to check if there are any babies flagged on their site. The maternity site makes sure records which appear on the tracking page are followed up.</li>
  <li>On day 17 of age, records are displayed in red if they are still flagged.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> can be used to identify babies with a ‘repeat required’ status but must not replace existing processes for communicating repeat requests or results</li>
  <li>data in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> should not be used as the primary source of data to populate the child health record or to give results to parents</li>
  <li>child health information services (<abbr title="Child Health Information Service">CHIS</abbr>) remain responsible for ensuring <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening coverage</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> data sources</h3>

<h4>Demographic details</h4>

<p>The demographic data in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> originates from the data provided when the NHS number is generated soon after birth, normally by the labour ward midwife.</p>

<p>Users can amend or update the demographic details. This will not update the <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr> record (the ‘spine’), S4N (screening for newborn infant physical examination) or S4H (screening for hearing) IT systems.</p>

<p>Users can print <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-numbers-for-newborn-screening-specification-for-the-blood-spot-card-label">barcode labels</a> in the demographic details section.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>The screening laboratories upload the screening outcome to the results section in <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<p>Any user can add notes to a baby’s record on <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The system will automatically add notes, for example, when a record is transferred to another site by a user. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/an-explanation-of-the-notes-in-nbsfs">list of automatic notes</a> is available.</p>

<p>To identify the user who added a note, hover the cursor over the user <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr> and their details will be shown.</p>

<h3>Operational level agreements</h3>

<p><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening providers and other stakeholders must use the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. This is mandated in the service specifications.</p>

<p>Operational level agreements (<abbr title="operational level agreements">OLAs</abbr>) describe how Child Health Record Departments <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-level-agreements-for-chrd-users">(<abbr title="child health record departments">CHRDs</abbr>)</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-level-agreements-for-laboratory-users">laboratories</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-levels-agreements-for-maternity-users">maternity departments</a> should use the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> and outline the responsibilities of the system provider and the NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening Programme.</p>

<h3>Feedback and change requests</h3>

<h3>Laboratory users</h3>

<p>Guidance for <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> laboratory functions is not included in this publication.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>This section explains what to do if problems occur within the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. You can contact the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk or customer portal. Email the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NBSFS.helpdesk@nhs.net"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.helpdesk@nhs.net</a> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814149/NBSFS_record_query_form.xlsx" rel="external">record query form (<abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>)</a> if your query is about a record. Ring them if the problem is urgent.</p>

<h3>The baby has completed screening but the record remains on the tracking page</h3>

<p>Complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> and forward to the relevant <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening laboratory or <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<p>Records of screened babies can appear or remain on the tracking page for several reasons, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data provided at birth notification does not match the data on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> card. Matching is delayed because the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system will not automatically match the record and the card. Common data errors include wrong date of birth (<abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr>) on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> card or the mother’s NHS number appearing on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> card instead of the baby’s.</li>
  <li>The laboratory has tested the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> card but has not uploaded the record into the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. Occasionally the laboratory upload is delayed, for example, if emergency situations or technical problems occur. The date and time of the most recent laboratory upload for the site’s primary laboratory is displayed on the tracking page.</li>
  <li>The laboratory has unsuccessfully tried to upload the card details to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> database. Occasionally files contain errors and the record is not successfully uploaded.</li>
  <li>A technical error may have occurred within the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system. If this happens, a message will appear on the log-in page.</li>
</ol>

<h3>‘Test patient’ on tracking page</h3>

<p>‘Test patient’ records can appear if there has been a local IT system test or change, or testing in the <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr> by NHS Digital. These records are clearly identified, usually as ‘XXTestPatientXX’. To remove ‘test patient’ records complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> and forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<h3>Record for an older baby appears unexpectedly on tracking page</h3>

<p>Outstanding records normally appear on the tracking page on day 12. Records for older babies, which were not previously on the tracking page, can appear in the following circumstances:</p>

<h4>Transferred from another <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site</h4>

<p>The record may have been transferred from another site. If so, the transfer icon will be highlighted. The originating site may have added a note to the ‘notes’ section of the record.</p>

<p>Accept or reject the transfer as appropriate (for more information see operational level agreements and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814151/NBSFS_quick_reference_guide.pdf" rel="external">quick reference guide</a>).</p>

<h4>Transferred by the system provider</h4>

<p>A record may be transferred in by the system provider. This occurs when a record cannot automatically be placed – for example if the postcode, <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code and hospital of birth entered into the <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr> are all incorrect.</p>

<p>The transfer icon will be highlighted and there will be an explanatory note in the ‘notes’ section of the record.</p>

<p>Accept or reject the transfer as appropriate. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/nbsfs-operational-levels-agreements-for-maternity-users">operational level agreements</a> and the quick reference guide.</p>

<h4>Wrong date of birth (<abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr>)</h4>

<p>If the <abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr> is wrong on the baby’s record in <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>,  users can correct it by editing the record.</p>

<p>Also email the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NBSFS.helpdesk@nhs.net"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.helpdesk@nhs.net</a> so the system provider can check for any previously uploaded sample cards which can be matched with the updated baby’s record.</p>

<h4>Change to screening status</h4>

<p>If a change to a baby’s record status in <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> is made after day 12 and the updated status now indicates that screening is not complete then the record will appear on the tracking page. This could happen if, for example, the laboratory was subsequently given new information about transfusion status or gestational age which invalidated the initial result.</p>

<p>Check the results section and the notes page of the record which may give updates on the status of the record.</p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>If none of the above applies and you are certain that the record has suddenly appeared, complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> and forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<h3>Duplicate record</h3>

<p>Complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> and forward to the relevant <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening lab or <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<h3>A record is on the wrong <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site</h3>

<p>The record should appear on the site responsible for screening the baby, usually based on the postcode or <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code of the mother’s address. Records may appear on the wrong site for the following reasons.</p>

<h4>The mother and baby have moved</h4>

<p>Maternity users can transfer records. If the baby has temporarily moved to a different location during the screening period, enter the temporary address in the relevant section, then transfer the record to the site responsible for screening, adding an explanatory note into the ‘notes’ section of the record (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<p>If the baby has moved permanently to a different address, update the demographic details and transfer the record to the site responsible for screening, adding an explanatory note into the ‘notes’ section of the record (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zD-sEIC4d3W4.kjyuIrZHfliI" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> map</a> shows the location of maternity hospitals and their associated <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> sites.</p>

<p>A list of postcodes and <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> codes and the associated <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> sites is also available to help identify where to transfer a record (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<h4>Record has been incorrectly mapped</h4>

<p>If a record has been wrongly allocated to your site (if the postcode or <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code has been incorrectly mapped to your <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site) then maternity users should transfer the record to the correct site (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide). You should then inform the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk using the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Shared postcodes</h3>

<p>Usually, only the first part of the postcode is used for mapping: for example HA4 or NW14. If this part of the postcode is shared between more than one site then the record is mapped to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site associated with the hospital of birth. This could result in records being wrongly mapped. A request can be made via the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk to have the full postcode mapped if this is a recurrent problem.</p>

<h3>Incorrect repeat request or result</h3>

<p>Complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> and forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> laboratory or <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as directed on the form.</p>

<h3>Wrong failsafe status</h3>

<p>Maternity users can change a baby’s failsafe status (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<p>If you cannot change the failsafe status to the appropriate status please complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> as directed and forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk.</p>

<h3>Demographic or data errors</h3>

<h4>If details have changed since birth</h4>

<p>Maternity users can update demographic information (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<p>You should also complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘record has demographic or data errors’ and adding the details in the ‘additional notes’ section. Forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form so the system provider can check for any previously uploaded sample cards which can be matched with the updated baby’s record.</p>

<h4>If demographic or data errors were made when the NHS number was generated</h4>

<p>Changes must be updated on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>, even if updates have been made on the maternity IT system or <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr>. This is because corrections made to maternity IT systems or <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr> do not update the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Maternity users can make simple demographic changes to a single record. More complex cases need to be referred to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk using the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Example: demographic changes to a single record</h4>

<p>Maternity users can update and correct demographic information such as NHS number, name, date of birth, gender and address (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide). Be particularly careful if changing the NHS number. Changes required to an NHS number tend to be more complex.</p>

<p>Whenever demographic details have been changed, please complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘record has demographic or data errors’ and add the details in the ‘additional notes’ section. Forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form in order for the system provider to check for any previously uploaded sample cards which can be matched with the updated baby’s record.</p>

<p>Any changes made on <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> will not update the <abbr title="Patient Demographic Service">PDS</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Example: removing a record from the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>
</h4>

<p>You must remove records from <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> when they were created in error, accidentally merged or are duplicates.</p>

<p>Complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘duplicate record’ or ‘other’ as appropriate, and adding clear notes in the ‘additional notes’ section. Forward to the relevant <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening lab or <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<p>If a new NHS number is created for a baby, it is essential to check that the new record has been entered into the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. Use the ‘national search’ function, enter the NHS number and search for the record. If the record does not appear, complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘record missing’ and adding explanatory notes in the ‘additional notes’ section. Forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<p>Removed records are securely stored using an auditable process.</p>

<h3>If a baby dies</h3>

<h4>A record for a deceased baby is on the tracking page</h4>

<p>Maternity and <abbr title="child health record department">CHRD</abbr> users can update the record to ‘deceased’ (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide). To avoid delay, this should normally be done by whichever <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user receives the information first.</p>

<h4>Updating the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> record when a baby has died</h4>

<p>If <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening has not been completed for the deceased baby, the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> must be updated without delay to minimise the risk of inappropriate contact being made with the family (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide). Maternity and <abbr title="child health record department">CHRD</abbr> users can update the record and, to avoid delay, it should normally be done by whichever <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user receives the information first.</p>

<p>All providers, such as maternity units and neonatal units, which have a deceased baby checklist or protocol, should include an action to notify the appropriate <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user of the death so that the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> record can be updated.</p>

<p>Updating the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> does not replace other forms of communication relating to a deceased baby. Local processes should be followed as usual.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening is complete, it is not necessary to update the record to ‘deceased’ status when a baby dies, but you can do so if you wish.</p>

<h4>Babies who died soon after birth and still-born babies</h4>

<p><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> does not receive data about babies who are still-born. In addition, if a baby dies before the midwife generates an NHS number, and this is indicated on the birth notification, then details will not be uploaded to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>When a record cannot be located</h3>

<p>Records can normally be located from within the user’s own site or using the ‘national search’ option (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<h4>Babies born in England or Isle of Man (<abbr title="Isle of Man">IOM</abbr>)</h4>

<p>If records cannot be located using the national search, complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘Record cannot be located’ and forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk.</p>

<h4>Babies born in Wales</h4>

<p>The system identifies babies born in Wales to English residents on the Welsh failsafe site and creates a record for them in <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. The <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> code and post code are used to map the record to an <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> maternity site. If this is unsuccessful, a manual process will be used. If a record is incorrectly matched to a site, it can be transferred out. The ‘national search’ option can be used to find a missing record.</p>

<p>More information about Welsh babies is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nww.bloodspot.northgate.thirdparty.nhs.uk/bloodspotweb/nhsbaby" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system</a>.</p>

<h4>Babies born outside England, Isle of Man and Wales</h4>

<p>A record for a baby born outside England, Isle of Man and Wales can be added to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> on request. This is not normally done but might be advisable, for example, if an unscreened baby in midwifery care has moved to England or Isle of Man. This would ensure the baby is tracked on <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> in the same way as a baby born in England.</p>

<p>Complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>, selecting ‘record missing’, and add explanatory notes in the ‘additional notes’ section. Forward to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as instructed on the form.</p>

<p>See more details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/movers-in-screening-babies-with-no-available-records"><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> screening of babies with no available records</a>.</p>

<h3>Baby resident/screened in Wales</h3>

<p>If the baby was born in England but is the screening responsibility of Wales (temporarily or permanently resident in Wales), or was screened in Wales, transfer the record to the ‘Wales’ site. For more information, see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide in the resources section of the system.</p>

<p>More information about <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> failsafe processes between Wales and England is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nww.bloodspot.northgate.thirdparty.nhs.uk/bloodspotweb/nhsbaby" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system</a>.</p>

<h3>Placing a record ‘out of England’</h3>

<p>The ‘out of England’ status is only for records of babies who have been confirmed as no longer the responsibility of the English screening programme or <abbr title="Isle of Man">IOM</abbr>. This is babies who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are resident in Scotland</li>
  <li>are resident in Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>are resident in the Channel Isles</li>
  <li>have moved to another non-UK country</li>
  <li>are the responsibility of United States Air Force (USAF) Lakenheath</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not use the ‘out of England’ status for any other reasons. Records marked as ‘out of England’ do not flag up on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> (even if screening is not complete) although they can still be located using the search functions.</p>

<h3>Baby resident/screened in Scotland</h3>

<p>If the baby was born in England but is the screening responsibility of Scotland, update the record status to the ‘out of England – Scotland’.</p>

<p>The record will no longer be followed up in the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> so records must only be set to ‘out of England – Scotland’ status if the baby is being screened in Scotland.</p>

<p>We cannot transfer records to an <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site in Scotland in the same way as we do for Wales as there is no electronic failsafe system in Scotland.</p>

<p>More information about <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> failsafe processes between Scotland and England is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nww.bloodspot.northgate.thirdparty.nhs.uk/bloodspotweb/nhsbaby" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> system</a>.</p>

<h3>Baby resident in England but screened elsewhere</h3>

<p>See the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="#screenedwales">Wales</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#screenedscotland">Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>For babies born in England and screened elsewhere, refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-sampling-guidelines"><abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> guidelines</a> to see if they should be offered screening in England:</p>

<p>If they are not eligible for screening or do not require screening, complete the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> as indicated and submit it to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk.</p>

<p>Otherwise, screening should be offered, as indicated in the guidelines, and the record should remain on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page until there is a screening result. Explanatory notes should be added to the ‘notes’ section of the baby’s record.</p>

<h3>Baby is in hospital</h3>

<h4>In a maternity hospital or neonatal unit attached to a maternity hospital</h4>

<p>The maternity hospital or neonatal unit can transfer the record into their own site (see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<p>The record should be transferred to the relevant maternity hospital <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site if it flags up on the tracking page of the home site (for more information see operational level agreements and the quick reference guide).</p>

<h4>In a paediatric hospital or children’s ward</h4>

<p>Most paediatric centres are not set up as sites on <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>  and the record should remain on the maternity site until screening is complete. If there are problems following up babies in paediatric care, please seek advice from your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide#sqas">regional <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> team</a>.</p>

<h3>Care by a private or independent midwife</h3>

<p>Some private hospitals are set up as <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> sites, for example Portland hospital. Their service will appear in the transfer drop-down list and the record should be transferred.</p>

<p>Most private or independent midwives do not use the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>, but babies in their care are entitled to be covered by the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>. The record will remain on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site (as defined by <abbr title="general practitioner (family doctor)">GP</abbr> and post code mapping) and be visible until screening is complete. If there are problems following up babies cared for by a private or independent midwife, please seek advice from your regional <abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr> team.</p>

<h3>A <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> user is changing role or no longer requires access</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk should be informed of a site lead change, preferably in advance by the existing site lead changing role.</p>

<p>If a user no longer requires access to <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr>, the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk must be contacted to deactivate their account. A successor must be appointed to take on <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Record query form (<abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>) guide</h2>

<h3>When to use the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>
</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> is used for queries such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>record on the tracking page when a <abbr title="blood spot">BS</abbr> sample has been taken</li>
  <li>error in a <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> record</li>
  <li>record has been assigned to the wrong site</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> record cannot be found</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> should not be used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>administration enquiries such as  password queries, new user requests</li>
  <li>training queries such as help using the system</li>
  <li>technical problems such as the system not operating correctly – contact the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk instead</li>
  <li>urgent issues such as an issue which may have a direct and immediate effect on patient safety or care – contact the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk instead</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintaining confidentiality</h3>

<p>Always send the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> via secure nhs.net email (sender and recipient) to protect patient identifiable information.</p>

<p>Avoid giving sensitive or clinical details unless essential.</p>

<p>State the helpdesk reference number in subsequent emails to avoid using identifiable data.</p>

<p>Do not forward the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> on to others and avoid copying others into emails, so that patient identifiable information is not inadvertently shared.</p>

<p>The confidential identifier can be used if a non-secure email address has to be used. To see the confidential identifier, hover the cursor over the baby’s first name on the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> tracking page. To copy and paste the confidential identifier, open the baby’s details and click on the notepad icon in the top right hand corner. Do not add any other identifying details.</p>

<h3>When a query involves more than one record</h3>

<p>If a query involves more than one record, only use one <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>records which have become mixed up, for example, twins records muddled, 2 babies with one NHS number, duplicate records</li>
  <li>several records on the tracking page with a probable common underlying cause</li>
</ul>

<p>Include all the affected NHS numbers in ‘Baby NHS Number’ section, separated by a comma but do not complete the <abbr title="date of birth">DOB</abbr> and surname sections.</p>

<p>Give the details of the query clearly in the ‘Additional Notes’ section.</p>

<p>In some circumstances it is not possible or necessary to list every NHS number involved. Discretion can be applied but communication must be clear.</p>

<h3>Where to send the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>
</h3>

<p>When the ‘enquiry reason’ is selected from the drop-down list, the ‘action to be taken’ will appear below. This indicates whether to forward the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> to the screening laboratory, to the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk or whether the query can be resolved by the user.</p>

<p>Remember to maintain confidentiality when sending the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Is the <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> compulsory?</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="record query form">RQF</abbr> is not mandatory but using it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensures that the necessary information is provided and correct actions are taken to speed up a response</li>
  <li>helps the helpdesk to prioritise and respond to queries consistently</li>
  <li>allows the <abbr title="newborn blood spot">NBS</abbr> laboratories to respond to queries efficiently</li>
  <li>provides an audit trail which cannot be captured by ad hoc phone calls</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk will continue to respond to queries made by email or phone.</p>

<h3>What to do if the query is unresolved</h3>

<p>If queries are not resolved the escalation process can be found in the operational level agreements.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> site restructure</h2>

<p>If a site is planning an organisational restructure, for example a merger, please inform the <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> helpdesk as early as possible so the required changes in <abbr title="newborn blood spot failsafe solution">NBSFS</abbr> can be made in time. Please follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-blood-spot-screening-failsafe-solution-user-guide/process-for-trust-mergers-on-nbsfs">trust merger guidance</a>.</p>
