<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary of Grant Funding</h2>

<p>The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is providing £1.5 million of grant funding for Uniformed Youth Organisations to establish new groups/units in deprived areas in England, currently underserved by uniformed youth organisations. An assessment panel, appointed by DCMS, will review bids from eligible organisations using the evaluation criteria set out in section 8 to determine which organisations should be awarded funding and the amount awarded.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this grant award process, organisations eligible are those who are a recognised body within the Youth United Network (excluding the Army Cadets and Air Cadets). This grant will provide resource funding only, to be utilised in the Financial Year 2022/23. Applicants should outline their proposed projects, alongside a scaled budget.&nbsp; DCMS will cover administration costs between 2-6% of the total funding awarded.</p>

<p>The deadline for applications is 23:59 Sunday 25th September 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Purpose</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Fund Overview</h3>

<p>The £1.5 million Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund, aims to establish new uniformed youth groups in deprived areas of England, in communities currently underserved by Uniformed Youth Organisations. The fund aims to create approximately 2,200 places for young people aged 10 - 18&nbsp; to access activities which enable them to develop their skills for life and work and support their mental and physical wellbeing.</p>

<p>This fund supports the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-outlines-ambitious-plans-to-level-up-activities-for-young-people">National Youth Guarantee</a>, creating access to regular clubs and activities, trips away and opportunities to volunteer, as well as meeting government’s&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom">levelling up</a> priorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Fund Objectives</h3>

<p>The objectives of the Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To open new uniformed youth groups in deprived areas, currently underserved by Uniformed Youth Organisations. The Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund will aim to create approximately 2,200 places for 10 - 18 year olds.</li>
  <li>Improve the wellbeing of young people and help them to develop skills for life and work by expanding the reach, number and range of regular activities for young people that drive these outcomes.</li>
  <li>Support Uniformed Youth Organisations to build their internal capacity to scale up sustainably.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Target Group</h3>

<p>The target group this fund should help are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Young People aged 10 -18 in IMD 1-5 Upper Tier Local Authority Areas in England or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/youth-investment-fund-yif-places-selection-methodology">areas eligible for the Youth Investment Fund</a> currently underserved by uniformed youth services</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Organisation Eligibility</h2>

<p>To be eligible to apply for the Uniformed Youth New Groups Grant Fund, organisations must:</p>

  <li>Have a robust safeguarding policy</li>

  <li>Be predominately volunteer led</li>
</ul>

<p>Your organisation will also need to pass our due diligence checks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The grant award does not exceed 50% of your annual income, as an example: if an organisation applied for a £500,000 grant, the collective annual turnover needs to be £1,000,000 or more in order that the grant is not more than 50% of the annual turnover/income.</li>
  <li>We have received and reviewed at least 2 references</li>
  <li>If you have been funded by another part of government, we seek feedback from that department</li>
  <li>You are not already receiving funding for this project from government, meaning your project is funded twice</li>
  <li>Trustees are not related and there is no indication of fraud</li>
  <li>Where multiple organisations are located at the same postcode, there is no indication of fraud – if you do have the same postcode as other organisations you will be asked to provide an explanation</li>
  <li>You are able to provide an annual report and audited or certified accounts, covering the last two years or similar documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: in the event your last financial year end was more than 6 months ago we may request further accounting information at a later date as part of the due diligence process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>England programme</h3>

<p>The Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund is provided by the DCMS Civil Society and Youth directorate, which funds activities which directly or indirectly benefit the whole or part of England (whether or not they also benefit any other area).

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Financial Requirements</h3>

<p>Please note: The DCMS financial year runs 1 April to 31 March. If successful, drawdown requests and budget must fit the DCMS financial year.</p>

<p>Payments will be made quarterly and in arrears. You will need to provide a breakdown of actual, eligible expenditure in order to make a claim. We will only pay out the amount you can evidence as spent.</p>

<p>Variations between proposed drawdown amounts and actual drawdown requests across quarters of the same financial year will be accepted, with explanation and justification. However, we will not be able to vary funds across financial years. Any funds not drawn down by the end of the financial year will become unavailable.</p>

<p>DCMS makes payments in arrears and only pays in advance by exception. If you wish to be paid in advance, you will be asked to explain and justify your reasons in your application, this includes ensuring that your request fits with one or more of the ‘payment in advance’ criteria outlined in the application form. Your request will be considered as part of the assessment process. If your application and request to be paid in advance are approved, you will be expected to provide quarterly reconciliation details for the duration of your project detailing any underspend against funds received. You will be required to reconcile any underspend before further funding is released. You will also be required to complete a formal Financial Reconciliation Statement (FRS) form at the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>Whether paid in arrears or in advance, you must be able to transparently report on a quarterly basis and provide evidence of expenditure of the use of the Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund. The Uniformed Youth New Groups Fund must be shown as restricted funds in your accounts and you must be able to identify separately the value and purpose of the grant in your audited accounts. You will be asked to describe the financial management systems and processes you will put in place to ensure you can achieve this in your application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Grant Monitoring and Reporting</h2>

<p>DCMS is committed to robust monitoring and evaluation of grant funding, proportionate to the size and length of the grant. Successful applicants are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide monthly financial and performance monitoring data returns for the grant funding period. DCMS will provide a template for returns.</li>
  <li>Attend monthly monitoring meetings to report on the progress of grant awards (based on the monitoring returns) and update on risks/slippage on spend</li>
  <li>Work with the independent evaluation partner and/or DCMS to support design of the evaluation and collection of relevant data for the overarching process and impact evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Evaluation</h2>

<p>DCMS will separately commission an independent evaluation for this fund, in conjunction with the National Youth Guarantee. Successful applicants must work together with the appointed evaluator.</p>

<p>The evaluation will likely include both process and impact strands to understand the reach and delivery of the projects, as well as its impact on young people. We expect that the evaluation will utilise data and evidence collected/generated by the successful applicants. See Annex 1 for an indicative list of data measures we are interested in.</p>

<p>We expect this evaluation will continue into FY 23/24.</p>

<h4>1. Initial sift</h4>

<p>We will review your application to check that the information in the body of the application meets the eligibility checklist.</p>

<h4>2. Individual evaluation of eligible bids</h4>
