<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The content of this document is guidance only with no statutory status. However, all parties should follow the general principles, as will Inspectors who may adapt them as necessary for an individual appeal whilst ensuring that no party is prejudiced.  It should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lawful-development-certificates">planning practice guidance</a> published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1. </span> Background</h3>

<p>1.1.1. There are 3 types of lawful development certificate that may be applied for under section 191 and section 192 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/contents" rel="external">Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/26H" rel="external">section 26H of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 191 â whether an existing use of buildings, land, operational development or activity in breach of a planning condition is lawful</li>
  <li>section 192 â whether a proposed use of buildings, land or operations intended to be carried out would be lawful</li>
  <li>section 26H â whether proposed works for the alteration or extension of a listed building would be lawful</li>
</ul>

<p>1.1.2. A certificate of lawful use or development under sections 191 and 192 is sometimes referred to as a âcertificate of lawfulness of existing use or developmentâ (CLEUD) or âcertificate of lawfulness of proposed use or developmentâ (CLOPUD). Both are commonly referred to as a âlawful development certificateâ (<abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>). This Guide uses the phrases â<abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> applicationâ and â<abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appealâ.</p>

<p>1.1.3. The procedure for <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> is contained in Article 39 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015</a>.</p>

<p>11.1.4. Once the local planning authority (<abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>) have received a valid <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> application, they must give the applicant written notice of their decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within 8 weeks beginning with the day after the date on which the application is received</li>
  <li>or within any extended period that may have been agreed in writing between the applicant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>:Local Planning Authority</li>
</ul>

<p>1.1.5. A Listed building certificate of lawfulness of proposed works under section 26H is commonly referred to as a âlisted building lawful development certificateâ (<abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>). This guide uses the phrases â<abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> applicationâ and â<abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appealâ.</p>

<p>1.1.6. The procedure for <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> is contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/552/contents/made" rel="external">Planning (Listed Buildings) (Certificates of Lawfulness of Proposed Works) Regulations 2014 Statutory Instrument No 2014/552</a>.</p>

<p>1.1.7.	Once the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> have received a valid <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> application, they must give the applicant written notice of their decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>within 6 weeks beginning with the day after the date on which the application is received</li>
  <li>or within any extended period that may have been agreed in writing between the applicant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>1.1.8.	If an application for a <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>/<abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wholly or partly refused</li>
  <li>or is granted in a different form from the application</li>
  <li>or is deemed to have been refused where the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> has not determined the application within the time-limit (see paragraphs 1.1.4 and 1.1.6)</li>
</ul>

<p>the applicant has a right of appeal.</p>

<p>This right is given under section 195 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/contents" rel="external">Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)</a>for <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> applications (Section 191 and 192 applications) and under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/26H" rel="external">section 26K of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)</a>for <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> applications (section 26H applications).</p>

<p>1.1.9. The grant of a <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> following appeal applies only to the lawfulness of development in accordance with planning legislation. It does not remove the need to comply with any other legal requirements such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2214/contents/made" rel="external">The Building Regulations 2010</a>, or the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) or other licensing or permitting schemes.</p>

<p>1.1.10. Once a certificate is granted the lawfulness of that use or operation is conclusively presumed, provided, in the case of a proposed development, that nothing material has changed that could affect lawfulness before development begins.</p>

<p>1.1.11. As per <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/191" rel="external">Section 191(2)(b) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)</a>, a certificate cannot be granted that contravenes the requirements of an enforcement notice or a breach of condition notice then in force (See DLUHC âs guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ensuring-effective-enforcement">breach of conditions notices</a>) - this does not apply to <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>âs.</p>

<p>1.1.12. If we consider that an enforcement notice is in force which will prevent the grant of an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> so that the appeal will be dismissed, we may write to the appellant (the person making the appeal) and explain this. If despite this the appellant proceeds with an appeal they may leave themselves open to an award of costs against them â pursuing an appeal in circumstances where an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> cannot be granted could be seen as unreasonable behaviour. See section 2.2 for further information on costs.</p>

<p>1.1.13. From here on, where it refers to an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> that includes an <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> unless the wording indicates differently.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Before an appeal is made</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span> Responsibilities of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and appellant</h3>

<p>2.1.1. While the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  should always co-operate with an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> applicant asking for information about the planning status of the land by making records readily available they need not go to great lengths to show that the subject of the application is or is not lawful.</p>

<p>2.1.2. However, it is best practice for the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  to have constructive discussions with applicants and, if it has any concerns, give the applicant the opportunity to amend the application before it is decided. This should help to avoid the need to appeal, especially appeals where the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  has failed to make a decision.</p>

<p>2.1.3. When refusing an application for an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  should consider carefully whether it has a sufficiently strong case for doing so.</p>

<p>2.1.4. Clear reasons for refusal of the <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> application will help continued discussions and may mean that a new application with an amended proposal or with additional evidence would be the best way forward. <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> s should be open to discussions on whether it is likely to view what is described in an amended application as lawful.</p>

<p>2.1.5. Potential appellants should consider the reasons for refusal carefully when deciding whether to make an appeal. Appellants should be confident at the time they make their appeal that they have a clear case and do not need to rely on evidence that was not available to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> when it made its decision</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span> Costs</h3>

<p>2.2.1. All parties are expected to meet their own appeal expenses.</p>

<p>2.2.2. If a party does not behave reasonably during the appeal process, they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them.  This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>2.2.3.  Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties.  Also, the Inspector may make an award of costs even if none of the parties have made an application.</p>

<p>2.2.4.  There is guidance about costs awards in the DLUHCâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals">planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>2.2.5.  Before you appeal, it is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span> Eligibility for making an appeal</h3>

<p>2.3.1.  Only the person who made the application for an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> can make an appeal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span>  Deadline for making an appeal</h3>

<p>2.4.1.  For appeals under section 195 (see paragraph 1.1.8), there is currently no time limit within which an appeal must be received. However, we would expect to receive an appeal within 6 months.</p>

<p>2.4.2.  An appeal under Section 26k (see paragraph 1.1.8) must be received by us within 6 months of the date of the local planning authorityâs decision notice or the date by which the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> should have decided the application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>  Making an appeal</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1. </span>  How to make an appeal</h3>

<p>Appellants should use the Lawful development certificate appeals: how to complete your appeal form  guide to help them complete the appeal form.</p>

<p>3.1.1.  If an appellant wants to make an appeal in relation to more than one application, they must make a separate appeal for each.</p>

<p>3.1.2.  Wherever possible the appellant should make their appeal online through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">Appeals Casework Portal</a>.</p>

<p>3.1.3.  We encourage all parties to work electronically with us both online and by email. For further information about working electronically with us, please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appealing-to-the-planning-inspectorate-communicating-electronically-with-us">guide to communicating electronically with us</a></p>

<p>3.1.4.  If a potential appellant does not have access to the internet, they should contact us and we will send them the relevant appeal form. See 8.4 for how to contact us.</p>

<p>3.1.5.  Appellants must send a copy of the appeal form and supporting documents to us and to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> .</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2. </span>  Procedure preference</h3>

<p>3.2.1.  With reference to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a>, appellants must state on the appeal form which procedure they think is most appropriate for the appeal and the reasons for their preference. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  must do the same in the questionnaire. For an explanation of each procedure, see section 7. Whilst the criteria do not directly apply to <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals, they provide a useful indication of which procedure would be most appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3. </span> Appeal statement</h3>

<p>3.3.1. As part of the appeal form, appellants must submit an appeal statement. This should be a clear and concise statement of the appellantâs case and contain the reasons why they consider the development to be lawful.</p>

<p>3.3.2. The appellant should not withhold information at an early stage, to attempt to introduce additional evidence at a later stage.</p>

<p>3.3.3. The appeal statement should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain clearly why the appellant disagrees with each of the reasons for refusal and respond to any counter evidence put forward by others
*include the full report reference if any case law is cited</li>
  <li>not contain excessive detail of the site. The Inspector will observe details at the site visit</li>
  <li>include a history of the site including any relevant applications</li>
</ul>

<p>3.3.4. For further guidance on what to include in the appeal statement, please see our guide <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lawful-development-certificate-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Lawful development certificate appeals: how to complete your appeal form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> After the appeal is submitted</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Validation</h3>

<p>4.1.1 Once an appeal has been submitted, we will check whether it is valid. If the appeal is valid, we will confirm to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and the appellant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the procedure the appeal will follow</li>
  <li>the appeal start date</li>
  <li>the timetable for the appeal</li>
  <li>the address to which all correspondence should be sent</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Procedure determination</h3>

<p>4.2.1 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/319A" rel="external">Section 319A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a> gives us the duty to determine the procedure.</p>

<p>4.2.2 In making our decision, we will consider the views of the appellant and the local planning authority, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a> and expert involvement (where relevant).</p>

<p>4.2.3 Where our determination differs from that of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and appellant, we will explain the reasons for our choice.</p>

<p>4.2.4 The appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> can ask for the choice to be reviewed by a senior officer.</p>

<p>4.2.5 We keep our choice of procedure under review throughout the appeal. Subject to notification and procedural requirements, we may change the procedure. We may also, either at the outset or throughout the appeal, combine procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Combining procedures</h3>

<p>4.3.1 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/16/contents/enacted" rel="external">The Business and Planning Act 2020</a> allows us to âcombineâ procedures. For example, if we decide that an appeal should follow the inquiry procedure, we may choose, based on the criteria, to deal with certain issues by written representations.</p>

<p>4.3.2 Appeals proceeding by written representations will not normally be combined with other procedures.</p>

<p>4.3.3 It is for us to decide whether combining procedures is appropriate and how it would work (for example, which procedures are combined, what the timetable would be etc). If we are considering combining procedures, we will invite the parties to comment before any final decision is taken.</p>

<p>4.3.4 We keep the procedure choice, including combined procedures, under review. Subject to any notification and procedural requirement, we may change it at any point before the appeal decision is made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>  How the decision is made</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1. </span> The decision-maker</h3>

<p>5.1.1. Under section 195 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/contents" rel="external">Town and Country Planning Act 1990(as amended)</a> or section 26K of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/26H" rel="external">Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)</a>, the applicant has a right to make an appeal to the Secretary of State. Through legislation, for almost all appeals, the authority â âthe jurisdictionâ- to decide an appeal has been transferred to an Inspector.</p>

<p>5.1.2. In a very small number of cases, the Secretary of State may ârecoverâ the jurisdiction to decide the appeal. This is usually for very large or contentious appeals. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria</a> in the planning practice guidance used to decide if an appeal should be recovered.</p>

<p>5.1.3. The appeal may be recovered at any stage before the decision is issued even after a site visit, hearing and inquiry has taken place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2. </span> If an appeal is recovered</h3>

<p>5.2.1.	If an appeal is recovered, we will write to tell the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> setting out the reasons for this.</p>

<p>5.2.2.	A recovered appeal can proceed by written representations, hearing or inquiry or a combination of procedures and will follow the rules for each procedure.</p>

<p>5.2.3.	The Inspector will write a report which contains their recommendations on whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed. The Secretary of State takes in to account the Inspectorâs report when making their decision.</p>

<p>5.2.4.	The Secretary of Stateâs decision will be published in a letter by DLUHC . The letter will be available to view on either on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities">DLUHC âs area of GOV.UK</a> or online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3. </span> What the Inspector takes into account</h3>

<p>5.3.1. The Inspector will consider whether, on the balance of probabilities, on the facts of the case and relevant planning law, the existing or proposed development is or would be lawful and will decide the case on the best facts available.</p>

<p>5.3.2. The Inspector will not consider the planning merits of any proposed or existing use or operational development for <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals. The same is true for <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals however, for proposed <abbr title="Listed Building">LB</abbr> <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> works, decisions as to whether proposals affect the special architectural/historic character of a building in a particular way can involve a planning judgement.</p>

<p>5.3.3. It is open to applicants to apply to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  for planning permission or listed building consent, in the normal way, without prejudice to their application or appeal for an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.3.4. The Court has held that the appellantâs own evidence does not need to be corroborated by âindependentâ evidence, particularly if it is unchallenged, in order to be accepted. However, it is the appellantâs responsibility to provide clear evidence to justify the grant of a certificate.</p>

<p>5.3.5. The Inspector may find that part of what is described in the application is lawful and may issue an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> for that part of the application only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4. </span> If there is new legislation or new or emerging policies</h3>

<p>5.4.1. The Inspector will consider the lawfulness of the use or development on the date that the application was made to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  â under the legislation that was in force on that date.  National and local policies have no bearing on whether a development is lawful.</p>

<p>5.4.2. Where a change in circumstances is likely to affect the outcome of the appeal, we will ensure that all parties have an appropriate opportunity to comment on the new material.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> The role of Interested people</h2>

<p>6.1. People who are interested in the outcome of an appeal but are not one of the main appeal parties play an important role in appeals. Their views in support of, or opposition to, the grant of an <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> are taken into account by the Inspector.</p>

<p>6.2. Interested people are also called âthird partiesâ, âinterested partiesâ or âinterested personsâ.</p>

<p>6.3. Interested people are notified by the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> that the appeal is taking place. Whilst interested people have the opportunity to make representations, they will not be sent copies of representations made by the appellant, <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and other interested people. These documents may be made available for inspection by the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.4. The following guides explain how interested people can take part in appeals depending on which procedure the appeal follows:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> The Procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1. </span> Background</h3>

<p>7.1.1. There are 3 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations, hearings and inquiries.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2. </span> Written representations</h3>

<p>7.2.1. The regulations that cover this procedure are the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/2683/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002 (Statutory Instrument 2002/2683)</a>. Although these regulations do not formally apply to <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals, where the appeal proceeds by written representations it will be conducted within the spirit of the regulations.</p>

<p>7.2.2. The timetable for a written representations appeal is as follows:</p>

<table>

</table>

<h4>7.2.3. The written representations procedure</h4>

<p>7.2.3.1. In the written representations procedure, the Inspector will decide the appeal based on written material provided by all parties and, usually, after a visit to the appeal site.</p>

<p>7.2.4. The appellant</p>

<p>7.2.4.1. The appellant must submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their appeal</li>
  <li>a copy of the <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> application</li>
  <li>a copy of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>âs decision notice</li>
  <li>other essential supporting documents detailed on the appeal form</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, they must copy the appeal to the local planning authority. For further information on how to submit the appeal please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lawful-development-certificate-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Lawful development certificate appeals: how to complete your appeal form guide</a>.</p>

<p>7.2.4.2.  The appellantâs representations should disclose their case through an appeal statement and any supporting evidence. For further information about the appeal statement please see section 3.3.</p>

<p>7.2.4.3. Although the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria</a> do not directly apply to <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals they provide an indication of which procedure would be appropriate. The appellant must indicate which procedure they consider appropriate, taking account of the criteria.</p>

<h4>7.2.5. Notification to interested people</h4>

<p>7.2.5.1. There is no statutory requirement for <abbr title="local planning authorities">LPAs</abbr> to consult interested parties including parish councils or neighbours.&nbsp;However, it may be reasonable for them to seek their views.&nbsp; If the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> wish to notify anyone of the appeal they should do so within 2 weeks of the start date.</p>

<p>7.2.5.2. The notification should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a description of the development</li>
  <li>the appeal procedure</li>
  <li>an invitation to interested people to make their views known by submitting their views online through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a> within 6 weeks of the start date of the appeal - If the interested person cannot submit their comments online, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  will provide details of how to submit representations by email or post</li>
  <li>that any representations sent to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> in relation to the application will be sent to the Planning Inspectorate and the appellant and will be considered by the Inspector when deciding the appeal unless they are withdrawn before the 6 weeks deadline</li>
  <li>that the Planning Inspectorate will not acknowledge receipt of representations</li>
  <li>that they can get a copy of our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-dealt-with-by-written-representations-taking-part">Guide to taking part in enforcement appeals and lawful development certificate appeals proceeding by written representations</a> free of charge from the local planning authority, on its website or on GOV.UK</li>
  <li>when and where the appeal documents will be available for inspection</li>
  <li>that the decision will be published online</li>
</ul>

<p>7.2.5.3. We encourage local planning authorities to use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-appeals-model-notification-letters-for-local-planning-authorities">model notification letter</a>.</p>

<h4>7.2.6. The appeal questionnaire</h4>

<p>7.2.6. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  must send a completed copy of our questionnaire and copies of all the relevant documents to us and to the appellant within 2 weeks of the start date of the appeal.</p>

<p>7.2.6.2. Although the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">Criteria</a> do not directly apply to <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals they provide an indication of which procedure would be appropriate. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  must indicate on its questionnaire which appeal procedure it considers appropriate, taking account of the criteria.</p>

<p>7.2.6.3. The relevant documents considered during the application process should be sufficient to present the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> âs case. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  should notify us and the appellant if it decides to treat the questionnaire, and supporting documents, as its full representations on an appeal.</p>

<h4>7.2.7. <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> âs representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>7.2.8.1. The appellant may decide to rely on their initial appeal statement and the documents accompanying it as their representations on their appeal.</p>

<p>7.2.8.2. If the appellant decides to make any further representations, these should be sent to us within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy these further representations to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr></p>

<h4>7.2.9. Interested peopleâs representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>7.2.9.1. To make sure that the Inspector takes their views into account, interested people should send their representations to us. If they send their representations to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> , the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  may forward the representations to us for the Inspectorâs attention, but they do not need to.</p>

<p>7.2.9.2. Representations should be submitted online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>. If this is not possible, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  will provide details of how to submit representations by email or by post. These must be received within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy any representations received to the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> . There is normally no further opportunity for interested people to make representations after the 6-week stage.</p>

<h4>7.2.10. Comments at the 9-week stage</h4>

<p>7.2.10.1. If either the appellant or the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  wishes to comment on the otherâs appeal statement or any representations made at the 6-week stage, they must send their comments to us within 9 weeks of the start date. These comments should not introduce new material. We will copy the comments to the other appeal party.</p>

<h4>7.2.11. Site visit</h4>

<p>7.2.11.1. Visits to the appeal site and any relevant neighbouring land or properties are normally carried out where it is necessary for the Inspector to assess the impact of a development on its surroundings or measurements need to be taken. The purpose of the visit is solely for the Inspector to view the site and its surroundings.</p>

<p>7.2.11.2. Where the site is sufficiently visible from the road or public viewpoint, the visit will be carried out unaccompanied.</p>

<p>7.2.11.3. Where access is required, it may be necessary for a representative of the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to attend the site visit. Arrangements will be made with neighbours where it is necessary to inspect the site from their property.</p>

<p>7.2.11.4. An accompanied site visit is not an opportunity for those present to discuss the merits of the appeal or the written evidence they have provided. The Inspector will therefore not allow discussion about the appeal with anyone at the site visit. But parties may point out physical features that they have referred to in their written evidence.</p>

<p>7.2.11.5. A site visit wonât be needed for every appeal. It is for the Inspector to decide whether to conduct one.</p>

<h4>7.2.12. Late submissions</h4>

<p>7.2.12.1. Sticking to the timetable is fundamental to a fair and efficient appeal service. Normally If we receive a document after the relevant deadline, we will return it and it will not be seen by the Inspector. For the timetable see 7.2.2.</p>

<p>7.2.12.2. However, the Inspector can, at their discretion, accept a late document. They will need an explanation for why it was late, an explanation of how the material contained in it is relevant and to seek the opposing partiesâ views on whether it should be accepted.</p>

<p>7.2.12.3 The Inspector will only generally accept a late document if they are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would not have been possible for the party to have provided the evidence within the deadlines</li>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>
  <li>that it is directly relevant and necessary for their decision</li>
  <li>that it would be procedurally fair to all parties</li>
</ul>

<p>7.2.12.4 If the Inspector does accept a late document, this may disrupt the appeal timetable. In this case, the party that submitted the late document opens themselves up to a costs award as a result either of a costs application by another party or at the initiation of the Inspector. For further information on costs, see 2.2.</p>

<h4>7.2.13. Audio/video evidence</h4>

<p>7.2.13.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence. However, you may send a written summary within the 6-week deadline.</p>

<p>7.3.3.5. Or the Inspector might visit the site during the hearing or after closing the hearing, accompanied by the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> if they wish to attend. As the hearing has not been adjourned to the site the Inspector will not allow any discussion at the site.</p>

<p>7.3.3.6. We may, at any point before the appeal decision, âcombineâ procedures. For further information on combining procedures, see 4.3.</p>

<h4>7.3.7. Interested peopleâs representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>7.3.7.1. To make sure that the Inspector takes their views into account, interested people should send their representations to us.

<p>7.3.7.2. Representations should be submitted online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>. If this is not possible, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  will provide details of how to submit representations by email or by post.

<h4>7.3.11. Late submissions</h4>

<p>7.3.11.2. However, the Inspector can, at their discretion, accept a late document. They will need an explanation for why it was late, an explanation of how the material contained in it is relevant and to seek the opposing partiesâ views on whether it should be accepted.</p>

<p>7.3.11.3. The Inspector will only generally accept a late document if they are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would not have been possible for the party to have provided the evidence within the deadlines</li>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>
  <li>that it is directly relevant and necessary for their decision</li>
  <li>that it would be procedurally fair to all parties</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3.11.4. If the Inspector does accept a late document, this may disrupt the appeal timetable. In this case, the party that submitted the late document opens themselves up to a costs award as a result either of a costs application by another party or at the initiation of the Inspector. For further information on costs, see 2.2.</p>

<h4>7.3.12. Openness and transparency</h4>

<p>7.3.12.1. Hearings are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people.

<p>7.3.12.2. If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h4>7.3.13. Audio/video evidence</h4>

<h4>7.4.3. The inquiry procedure</h4>

<p>7.4.3.1. An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, complex and/or technical evidence, usually through expert witnesses, including by the use of giving evidence on oath and cross-examination. Parties may be formally represented by advocates. The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>7.4.3.2. We may, at any point before the appeal decision, âcombineâ procedures. Please see 4.3 for further information on combined procedures.</p>

<h4>7.4.4. The appellant</h4>

  <li>a copy of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> âs decision notice</li>
  <li>other essential supporting documents detailed on the appeal form</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, they must copy the appeal to the local planning authority.</p>

<p>7.4.4.2. The appellantâs representations should disclose their case through an appeal statement and any supporting evidence. For further information about the appeal statement please see 3.3.</p>

  <li>the expected number of witnesses</li>
  <li>topics to be addressed by witnesses</li>
  <li>whether there will be legal representation</li>
  <li>an estimate for the overall inquiry length</li>
</ul>

<p>7.4.4.4. The appellant should be realistic. The estimate should include time for opening and closing statements, and the time they consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both their and the local planning authorityâs witnesses and to interested people. If the appellant has instructed an advocate, they should get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<h4>7.4.5. The appeal questionnaire</h4>

<p>7.4.5.1. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must send a completed appeal questionnaire and copies of all the relevant documents to us and to the appellant within 2 weeks of the start date of the appeal.</p>

<p>7.4.5.2. Although the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria</a> do not directly apply to <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> appeals they provide an indication of which procedure would be appropriate. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>  must indicate on its questionnaire which appeal procedure it considers appropriate, taking account of the criteria.</p>

<p>7.4.5.3. If, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> agrees that the case ought to be dealt with by inquiry, the expected number of witnesses, topics to be addressed by witnesses, time estimates for the overall inquiry length and the presentation of the local planning authorityâs case and whether there will be legal representation should be included with the questionnaire.</p>

<h4>7.4.6. Setting the length of the inquiry</h4>

<p>7.4.6.1. We will take account of the initial estimates we receive from the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry. Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable. A form may be sent later in the process asking for more detailed information on the duration of the inquiry, including detailed information about witnesses and evidence.</p>

<h4>7.4.7.  Notification to interested people</h4>

<p>7.4.7.1. Within 2 weeks of the start date the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must notify the following people that an appeal has been made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it would not have been possible for the party to have provided the evidence within the deadlines</li>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>

<p>7.4.17.2. If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h4>7.4.18. Audio/video evidence</h4>

<p>7.4.18.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the inquiry. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, and the main parties.

The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>7.4.18.3. If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector, it will become part of the inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector.

<p>8.3.1. Expert evidence is evidence that is given by a person who is professionally qualified to express an opinion on a particular subject. It can be used in all 3 procedures.</p>

<p>8.3.2. It is the duty of an expert to help the Inspector. This duty overrides any duty the expert may have to the party that involved them in the appeal or that is paying them.</p>

<p>8.3.3. The evidence should be accurate, concise and complete and should represent the expertâs honest and objective opinion. If the expert belongs to a professional body that has a code of practice on professional conduct dealing with giving evidence, the expert is expected to comply with the code.</p>

<p>8.3.4. Expert evidence should include an endorsement such as that set out below or similar (such as that required by a particular professional body):</p>

<p>âThe evidence which I have prepared and provide for this appeal reference APP/xxx (in this proof of evidence, written statement or report) is true [and has been prepared and is given in accordance with the guidance of my professional institution] and I confirm that the opinions expressed are my true and professional opinions.â</p>

<p>This will enable the Inspector and others involved in an appeal to know that the material in a proof of evidence, written statement or report is expert evidence.</p>

<p>8.3.4.1. Giving expert evidence does not prevent an expert from acting as an advocate so long as it is made clear through the endorsement or otherwise what is expert evidence and what is not.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span> The Decision</h2>

<p>9.1. When made, the decision will be published online and can be viewed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>	Complaints, challenges and feedback</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1. </span> Challenge an administrative decision</h3>

<p>10.1.1. If the appellant, <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> or an interested person believe that we have made an incorrect administrative decision in the way we have processed the appeal, they should write to our Case Officer giving clear reasons why they think we should review our decision. We will review the decision and if we choose to stick with the original decision, we will explain why.</p>

<p>10.1.2. There is no statutory right to challenge an administrative decision in the High Court. However, it is possible to make an application for judicial review. Rule 54.5(5) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules" rel="external">Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (as amended)</a> requires that an application for judicial review relating to a decision of the Secretary of State (our administrative staff make decisions about the processing of an appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State) under the planning acts, must be made not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose.</p>

<p>10.1.3. However, if the appeal is decided before the end of this time limit then the only way to challenge decisions by administrative staff would be as part of the challenge to the appeal decision itself through the High Court (see 10.4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2. </span> Complaints</h3>

<p>10.2.1. If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspectorâs decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case, it is dealt with by our Customer Quality team who are independent of the teams that process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">guide to our complaints procedure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3. </span> Slip rule</h3>

<p>10.3.1. Please note that, once issued, we are unable to change the appeal decision. The only way to do so is a successful High Court challenge.</p>

<p>10.3.2. However, under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/section/56#:~:text=56Correction%20of%20errors%20in%20decisions&amp;text=(a)if%20he%20is%20requested,is%20considering%20making%20the%20correction" rel="external">section 56 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004</a>, we have the power to correct certain types of errors on our decision notices. This is known as the âSlip Ruleâ. The only corrections we can make are ones which would not alter or vary the appeal decision.</p>

<p>10.3.3. If any person wants us to consider correcting a decision, they should explain clearly what error they think has been made.</p>

<p>10.3.4. Any request must be received within the High Court challenge period â 6 weeks beginning with the day after the date of the decision.</p>

<p>10.3.5. On receipt of a request, we will decide whether a correction should be made. If we issue a correction notice, it will be accompanied by an amended decision (superseding the original decision) which has full legal status. That decision will carry a fresh date and will replace (and be subject to the same provisions as) the original in all respects.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4. </span> High Court challenges</h3>

<p>10.4.1. There is a statutory right to challenge the decision on whether to allow or dismiss the appeal (the appeal decision) in the High Court. To do this, you must first apply for permission to submit the challenge.</p>

<p>10.4.2. There is also a statutory right to challenge costs decisions made in connection to an appeal decision in the High Court. To do this, you must first apply for permission to submit the challenge.</p>

<h4>10.4.3. Deadlines</h4>

<p>10.4.3.1. Permission to make a challenge must be sought within 6 weeks beginning with the day after the date of the appeal or costs decision.</p>

<h4>10.4.4. Eligibility for making a challenge</h4>

<p>10.4.4.1. Any aggrieved person may make a High Court challenge.</p>

<p>10.4.5.	Further guidance on High Court challenges</p>

<p>10.4.5.1. Please see the Administrative Courtâs detailed guidance on making a High Court challenge for further information:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/administrative-court-bring-a-case-to-the-court">Administrative Court: bring a case to the court</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>10.4.6. If a challenge succeeds</h4>

<p>10.4.6.1. The appeal returns to the Planning Inspectorate for âre-determinationâ. Please note that the Inspector re-determining the appeal may come to the same decision that gave rise to the challenge but for different or expanded reasons. We usually appoint a different Inspector to make the decision.</p>

<p>10.4.6.2. We give priority to re-determination cases and they are usually handled quickly.</p>

<p>10.4.6.3. Where the appeal was originally dealt with by written representations, we would normally re-determine it by means of further written representations. However, where there has been a material change in circumstances, we may opt for a different procedure, having regard to the published criteria.</p>

<p>10.4.6.4. Where the appeal was originally dealt with by hearing, we would normally re-determine it with an inquiry because we consider that an inquiry would be needed to fully examine the legal issues raised in court. However, where all parties agree that a hearing would be appropriate, we will take this into account when determining the procedure for the re-determined appeal.</p>

<p>10.4.6.5. Where the appeal was originally dealt with by an inquiry, we would normally re-determine it with an inquiry.</p>

<p>10.4.6.6. All the documents from the original appeal will be seen by the Inspector appointed to the re-determination. Where there have been significant changes in circumstances since the original decision, the Inspector would normally allow parties to submit further evidence to address these.</p>

<p>10.4.6.7. The redetermination will not normally follow the usual timetables. We will write to the main parties, and interested parties if appropriate, to let them know what will happen.</p>

<p>10.4.6.8. Arrangements for redetermination of costs decisions may differ.</p>

<p>10.4.6.9. We would normally try to agree dates for a hearing or an inquiry through our standard procedure.  Where the re-determined case is proceeding by written representations, we would normally contact the parties to make arrange for a further site visit, unless it has been agreed that a further site visit is unnecessary.</p>

<p>10.4.7. Commencing development before the time limit for a High Court challenge passes</p>

<p>10.4.7.1. There is a risk in commencing development before the High Court challenge time limit has expired. This is because if the <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr> is quashed by the Court, development will become unlawful. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> may consider taking enforcement action against development that exists without a valid planning permission or <abbr title="Lawful Development Certificate">LDC</abbr>.</p>
