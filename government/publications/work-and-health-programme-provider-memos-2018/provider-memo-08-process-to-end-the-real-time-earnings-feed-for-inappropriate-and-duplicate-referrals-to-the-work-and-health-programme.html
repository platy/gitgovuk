<p>This memo is for Work and Health Programme Providers.</p>

<p>Date: 28 February 2019</p>

<p>Action: For information and action</p>

<p>Timing: Immediate</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) feed was introduced to support the automated tracking of customer’s earnings from point of referral. The tracking of a customer’s earnings begins when a start date is entered into the Provider Referral and Payment system (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>) and ends when a customer either completes their allocated time on provision, achieves the earnings to achieve a job outcome payment or an end date is input into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> have identified that if a customer is inappropriately referred or a duplicate referral is sent and the referral feed has been backed out, the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> feed continues to track the customer’s earnings even though they have been removed from the programme. This impacts on any future referrals and tracking of earnings.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-memos-2018/provider-memo-05-process-for-inappropriate-referrals">LRM 05 ‘Process for inappropriate referrals’</a> outlines the process for identifying inappropriate referrals and the action that should be taken under these circumstances.  In addition to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-memos-2018/provider-memo-05-process-for-inappropriate-referrals">LRM 05</a> this memo confirms the process and gives additional steps and new reason codes that should be used to close down the referral and the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> feed.</p>

<h2>Summary and action</h2>

<p>In addition to the steps outlined in the provider guidance and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-memos-2018/provider-memo-05-process-for-inappropriate-referrals">LRM 05</a> we have introduced additional steps which include inputting an end date into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> and additional new reason codes. These steps, reason codes and cancellation action should be completed when an inappropriate or duplicate referral is identified.</p>

<p>The following information will shortly be included in the provider guidance. With immediate effect, you should follow the processes detailed below if you identify or are notified by Jobcentre Plus of an inappropriate or duplicate referral.</p>

<h2>Actions that should be taken when a customer is already participating in a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> funded programme or is employed prior to referral</h2>

<p>A customer may be incorrectly referred to you when the customer is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>already taking part in a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> funded provision</li>
  <li>already in employment prior to referral</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be required to take the most appropriate action to rectify the error and close down the referral and the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> Feed. The action you take in the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> will depend on the status of the referral:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the error is discovered before the customer has started on the programme, you are required to reject the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> recording the rejection reason of ‘Other’ – and signpost the customer back to Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>where the error is discovered after the customer has started on the programme, you should complete a PRaP14 which should be sent to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider the request and if rejected will notify you so you can continue to work with the customer</li>
  <li>should the request be approved <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> will inform you via email, and upon receipt you should input an ‘end date’ and ‘reason code 37’ (no longer eligible) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you should then signpost the customer back to Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> will complete the actions to back the referral out and will contact you via email to notify you that this has been completed</li>
  <li>upon receipt of the email you must promptly cancel the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>, recording a cancellation reason of ‘no contact’</li>
</ul>

<p>Please Note: The end date is the day after the start date.</p>

<h2>Actions to take when a customer starts work or has a job offer between referral and start</h2>

<p>Should a customer report that they have a job offer or have started employment or self-employment in between referral interview with Jobcentre Plus and engaging with you, you should take the following action, as in these circumstances the customer becomes ineligible for the programme.</p>

<p>Following the notification or identification of the error you are required to take the most appropriate action to close down the referral and the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> feed. The action you take in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> will depend on the status of the referral:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the error is discovered before the customer has started on the programme, you are required to reject the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> recording a rejection reason of ‘did not attend’ and signpost the customer back to Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>where the error is discovered after the customer has started on the programme, you should complete a PRaP14  which should be sent to <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider the request and if rejected will notify you via email so you can continue to work with the customer</li>
  <li>should the request be approved you will be informed via e-mail, upon receipt you should input an ‘end date’ and ‘reason code 1’’ (found work) into <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you should then signpost the customer back to Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> will complete the actions to back the referral out and will contact you via email to notify you that this has been completed</li>

</ul>

<p>Please Note: The end date is the day after the start date.</p>

<h2>Actions to take when you identify a duplicate referral to the Work and Health Programme</h2>

<p>You will be required to take the most appropriate action to rectify the error and close down the referral and the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> Feed. The action you take in the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> will depend on the status of the referral:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the error is discovered before the customer has started on the programme, you are required to reject the duplicate referral in <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> recording the rejection reason of ‘other’</li>
  <li>where the error is discovered after the customer has started on the programme, you should complete a PRaP14 which should be sent to the <abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="Provider Referral and Payment Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) e-mail <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk">prap.support@dwp.gsi.gov.uk</a>
