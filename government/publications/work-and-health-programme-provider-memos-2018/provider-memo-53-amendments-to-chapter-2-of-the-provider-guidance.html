<h2>Annex 1</h2>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>

<p>You could be eligible if you live in England or Wales and you’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a person resettled from Afghanistan in connection with the collapse of the Afghan government that took place on 15 August 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>The Home Office has announced that those arriving in the UK under these relocation and resettlement schemes will be granted Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain, with the exception of initial arrivals under the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (<abbr title="Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme">ACRS</abbr>) who have been initially granted 6-month Leave Outside the Rules ahead of being granted Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain. Granting Indefinite Leave to Enter or Remain provides certainty and stability to those resettling in the UK. It provides the right to work and recourse to public funds, including Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) benefits and services.</p>

<h3>Further detail</h3>

<p>People eligible for early access will be persons who have arrived in the UK under one of the 
following relocation and resettlement schemes established by the Home Office:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (<abbr title="Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy">ARAP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Previous scheme for locally-employed staff in Afghanistan (ex-gratia scheme)</li>
  <li>Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (<abbr title="Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme">ACRS</abbr>)</li>
</ol>

<h4>1. Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (<abbr title="Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy">ARAP</abbr>)</h4>

<p>This scheme is for Afghans, and their family members, who worked alongside British Government officials in Afghanistan. The scheme opened in April 2021 and it is estimated that approximately 6,900 Afghans and their dependants have been evacuated so far, with 5,000 being evacuated between 15 and 29 August.</p>

<h4>2. Previous scheme for locally-employed staff in Afghanistan (ex-gratia scheme)</h4>

<p>This scheme was announced in December 2012 and was set up to support locally employed staff who have worked for the British forces. This scheme is set to close in November 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/afghanistan-locally-employed-staff-ex-gratia-scheme/afghanistan-locally-employed-staff-ex-gratia-scheme-further-information-on-eligibility-criteria-and-offer-details">Afghanistan Locally Employed Staff Ex-Gratia Scheme: further information on eligibility criteria and offer details</a></p>

<h4>3. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (<abbr title="Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme">ACRS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>This scheme will provide those put at risk by recent events in Afghanistan with a route to safety to the UK. The plan is to resettle up to 20,000 people at risk, including 5,000 in the first year.</p>

<p>Further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/afghan-citizens-resettlement-scheme">Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme</a></p>

<p>Early access will also be allowed for any person not covered by one of the above schemes but who has left Afghanistan in connection with the collapse of the Afghan government that took place on 15 August 2021.</p>
