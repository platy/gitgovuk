<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1.	This memo informs you of amendments that have been made to Work and Health Programme (including <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) Provider Guidance concerning Non-Qualifying Earnings and the removal of temporary guidance concerning COVID-19 where appropriate.</p>

<p>2.	This amended Provider Guidance will serve as the live running guidance for Work and Health Programme (including <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) and will see the removal of all other versions of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dwp-provider-guidance">Provider Guidance</a> from our website www.gov.uk.</p>

<h2>Summary and action</h2>

<p>3.	These changes are following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions across the country and follow letters received by Providers from Nick Butler in November and December 2021.</p>

<p>4.	As changes have been made throughout the Chapters you and your supply chain should familiarise yourself with each Chapter in its entirety.</p>

<p>5.	This amended Provider Guidance should be used with immediate effect by you and your supply chain partners.</p>

<p>6.	You and your supply chain partners must now use the version of Provider Guidance  published on Gov.Uk. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-including-jets-provider-guidance">Work and Health Programme including <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> provider guidance</a></p>
