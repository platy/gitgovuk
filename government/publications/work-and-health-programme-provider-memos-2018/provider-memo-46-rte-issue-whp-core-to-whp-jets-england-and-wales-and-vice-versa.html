<p>This memo is for Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) providers.</p>

<p>Issued by: Work and Health Programme Operational Policy Team</p>

<p>Action: For information</p>

<p>Timing: Immediate</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1.	The purpose of this memo is to inform you of an issue that has been identified when a customer moves from either <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> <abbr title="England and Wales">E&amp;W</abbr> to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core programme or vice versa, either during time on programme (via the alternative provision process for <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr>) or the tracking period for <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core. This memo outlines the action that the department will be taking to address the issue and the steps that Providers are required to take to avoid the loss of performance.</p>

<h2>Summary and action</h2>

<p>2.	The Department has identified that when a Provider and work coach have identified that a <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> customer would be better suited to alternative provision i.e. <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core, in some circumstances, the alternative provision process has not been correctly followed. This results in the new provision not having a Real Time Earnings (<abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr>) line in place. As such, any performance associated with the new provision will not be attributed to the Provider. In addition to this, where a participant has started on the <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> or Core provision, during the tracking period of the previous provision, no tracking is in place (or vice versa).</p>

<p>3.	This issue also has an impact on European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) requirements because <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participants can only be linked to one Provision at a time.</p>

<h2>Actions</h2>

<p>4.	To ensure that the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line is in place for the new provision,  it is important that when it has been agreed and confirmed by the work coach, that a customer can be transferred to an alternative provision (for the <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> programme) the process which is outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-covid-19-provider-guidance/chapter-10-change-of-circumstances-and-notifications--2">Chapter 10: Change of Circumstances and notifications, Work and Health Programme (Covid 19) including <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> provider guidance</a> must be followed and Code 46 “exceptional circumstances” must be input to PRaP to ensure that the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line is closed down correctly. If this action is not undertaken, the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line will not close down and tracking on the new provision will not start, meaning no performance will be attributed.</p>

<p>5.	In order for the performance to be attributed for those referrals that currently don’t have a <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line in place, the department will undertake a management correction exercise for the <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> programme in addition to the end of cohort process for the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> core Programme. This will ensure that any performance is correctly attributed where the alternative provision process hasn’t been followed and the <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line has not been closed down correctly.</p>

<p>6.	For <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>, to ensure we do not inadvertently claim results twice for the same customer, where that customer has previously been on <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core programme and the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> forms have been sent in, the forms associated with the new <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> programme will not be accepted. This action will ensure that the department and you (the Provider) do not fail any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit requirements. If it is established that the referral has been closed down correctly for the first provision, and there is a <abbr title="Real Time Earnings">RTE</abbr> line in place for the second referral, then the form will not be rejected.</p>

<p>7.	The above steps will ensure that any performance is attributed to you correctly and ensures that both you and the department are compliant with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Requirements.</p>

<p>Please note: This memo refers to the <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> <abbr title="Job Entry Targeted Support">JETS</abbr> <abbr title="England and Wales">E&amp;W</abbr> and <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Core programme and the process outlines the steps that should be taken for these programmes only. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> are currently discussing with LGPs how this will be applied in their contract package areas.</p>
