<p>This memo is for Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) providers.</p>

<p>Issued by: Work and Health Programme Policy Team, Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1. Work and Health Programme (<abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr>) providers have requested further clarification and guidance regarding a number of mandation processes, including mandating Long Term Unemployed (<abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr>) Participants to their initial face to face meeting.</p>

<p>2. Following recent discussions with providers, this memo seeks to clarify the action they must take when mandating <abbr title="Work and Health Programme">WHP</abbr> Participants to their initial face to face meeting.</p>

<p>3. This memo also provides further detail regarding the completion of the UC194 form.</p>

<h2>Action for providers to take when mandating a <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant to their initial face to face meeting</h2>

<p>4.  If you mandate an individual to attend their initial face to face meeting, and they fail to attend the first appointment date, you must raise a compliance doubt referral on the appropriate referral form as detailed in Work and Health Programme provider guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-guidance">chapter 8</a>. You should not input a Did Not Attend (<abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr>) code into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments system">PRaP</abbr> immediately. You should continue to try to engage with the Participant and enable their attendance, up until Day 15 of your Customer Service Standard (<abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr>) period. Where the Participant does not contact you to rearrange their initial face to face meeting, you should not input the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> code before this date.</p>

<p>5. If the Participant has not contacted you prior to your entering the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> code into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments system">PRaP</abbr>, and is in receipt of Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit,">UC</abbr>), you must also notify the Universal Credit Decision Maker (<abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr>) on form UC194 that the Participant is no longer required to undertake the activity from the date you entered the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> code into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments system">PRaP</abbr>. This will enable the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> to end any period of open-ended sanction that may have been imposed.</p>

<p>6. Where the Participant contacts you to rearrange the meeting, you should make every effort to enable their attendance, up until Day 15 of your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> target period. If you choose to mandate the Participant to the rearranged meeting you must use the appropriate Mandatory Activity Notification (<abbr title="Mandatory Activity Notification">MAN</abbr>) to do this. You must also ensure you comply with the requirements contained in Work and Health Programme provider guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-guidance">chapter 5a</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-and-health-programme-provider-guidance">chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p>7. Where you are unable to arrange for the Participant to attend a subsequent interview, because doing so would cause you to fail to meet your <abbr title="Customer Service Standard">CSS</abbr> target, the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> date you input to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments system">PRaP</abbr> must be the latest date the Participant contacted you to try to arrange another appointment. If the individual is a <abbr title="Universal Credit,">UC</abbr> <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant, you must notify the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr>, on form UC194, that from the date you entered the <abbr title="Did Not Attend">DNA</abbr> code onto <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments system">PRaP</abbr>, the Participant is no longer required to undertake the activity.</p>

<h2>Completing the UC194 form correctly</h2>

<p>8. If a <abbr title="Long Term Unemployed">LTU</abbr> Participant is in receipt of Universal Credit, and has had a low level sanction imposed for failing to attend a mandated activity or appointment, you will notify the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> of the compliance doubt on form UC193. If the <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> imposes a sanction, the open ended part of the sanction will end when the Participant meets the compliance condition you notified to them. When you are satisfied that a Participant has met their compliance condition you must complete form UC194 â Request to Review a Sanction for Universal Credit form and send it to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit Decision Maker">UCDM</abbr> straightaway. When the Participant contacts you to rearrange an appointment or activity, following a failure to comply with a mandated requirement, and that appointment or activity is arranged for a future date, the compliance date that must be noted on the UC194 form is the date the Participant made contact provided with you, provided they subsequently attend the re-arranged meeting or activity.</p>

<p>9. Please ensure that you review your procedures and guidance for these processes and ensure they reflect the requirements outlined in this memo.</p>

<p>10. Updated Work and Health Programme provider guidance will be issued shortly.</p>
