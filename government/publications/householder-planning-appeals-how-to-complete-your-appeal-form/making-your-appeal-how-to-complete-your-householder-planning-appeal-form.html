<p>This guide shows you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an account</li>
  <li>Complete your form</li>
  <li>Submit your form</li>
  <li>Contact us</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (LPA). If you think that making changes to your proposal could resolve the LPA’s reasons for refusal, you should discuss these with the LPA rather than appealing to us. A further application to the LPA may be your best route.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h3>System Availability</h3>

<p>Our online facilities will usually be available 24 hours a day. We will sometimes need to take the system out of service for a while to implement upgrades. Wherever possible, we will do this outside of usual office hours.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you start, you should ensure that you have the following system requirements -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat (Version 9 or higher recommended);</li>
  <li>an internet browser (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox recommended);</li>
  <li>an email account.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>You need to create an account with us in order to make an appeal or make representations on an appeal. Registering will enable you to access our full range of electronic services, including a personal homepage.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/account/register.aspx" rel="external">Access the registration page</a>
If you are already registered with us, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">log in</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Your account</h3>

<h4>Personal homepage</h4>

<p>From this page you are able to –</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a new appeal;</li>
  <li>view your submitted appeal forms through ‘My cases’. These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of any appeal form you have submitted;</li>
  <li>search for a case using either the quick search facility (using the 7 digit case reference number) or, alternatively, you can search using other criteria (such as site address) with our advanced search;</li>
  <li>access any of your appeals or representations which you are still working on via the ‘Awaiting submissions’ facility. Please note that any appeals or representations which are still awaiting submission after 180 days will be automatically deleted;</li>
  <li>view submitted representations through ‘My representations’. This will include any representations you have submitted for your own case(s) and any representations which you may have submitted for other cases which you are interested in (for example, as an interested party). These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of the form upon submission;</li>
  <li>watch any cases which are of interest to you. Once you have found a case which you want to follow, you can click the ‘Watch case’ button on the Case Summary screen and the case will then be added to your ‘Watched cases’ list. If at any time you want to remove the case from your list, simply click the ‘Stop watching’ button on the Case Summary screen or click the red ‘x’ button on your homepage and the case will be removed from your list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Details</h4>

<p>This is where all the details you entered when creating your account are held. If at any time your details change, you should make amendments to them through this page, but please note you cannot change your name once your account has been created. It is your responsibility to ensure that your details are kept up to date.</p>

<p>If you make a change to your address details, telephone number or fax number then these details will be updated instantly on your account. If you change your email address, you will be sent an email confirming this change and asking you to verify the new email address. Once verified, your account will be updated.</p>

<p>You can change your password using the ‘Change Password’ button. You will be sent an email confirming that a change has been made. You will then need to log into your account again, using your new password.</p>

<h3>Making your appeal</h3>

<h4>Deadlines</h4>

<p>The LPA should decide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your householder planning application within 8 weeks of the date it accepted it as valid; or</li>
  <li>your application for prior approval of a larger single-storey rear extension within 42 days following the date of receipt.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must send your appeal and essential supporting documents to us <strong>and</strong> at the same time to the LPA, so that they are received within 12 weeks (or 28 days – see below) of the date shown on the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<p>You can send them to the LPA via email. Instructions on how to do this are within the confirmation of appeal email which you will receive upon successful submission of your appeal form.</p>

<p><strong>If we do not receive your appeal and documents within the time limit, we will not accept your appeal.</strong></p>

<h4>Reduced time for making a planning appeal where enforcement action is being taken</h4>

<p>Where an enforcement notice has been served on the same, or substantially the same, development as in the householder application within 2 years of the date the application was made, the period for receiving an appeal is within <strong>28 days</strong> of the date on the decision notice or of the date by which the LPA should have decided the application. Where an enforcement notice was served after the decision notice was issued or after the end of the period the LPA had to determine the application, the period for receiving an appeal is within <strong>28 days</strong> of the date the enforcement notice was served (unless this extends the normal 12 weeks deadline).</p>

<h2>Guidelines for submitting documents</h2>

<h3>Acceptable file formats</h3>
<p>PDF .pdf</p>

<p>Microsoft Word .doc or.docx</p>

<p>TIF .tif or .tiff</p>

<p>JPEG .jpg or .jpeg</p>

<p>PNG .png</p>

<p>ZIP .zip</p>

<h3>File sizes</h3>
<p>Documents submitted may be no bigger than 15mb each. It is your responsibility to keep your documents to a manageable size.
If you have documents that are larger than this, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break long documents into several files, but note the document naming conventions below.</li>
  <li>Try and use black and white wherever possible (unless submitting photographs).</li>
  <li>If submitting images, your software may have file/image compression facilities to make them smaller.</li>
  <li>Note scanned documents are usually bigger than non-scanned versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided you are using the acceptable file types above, you can use ZIP files to compress documents.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Remove any document security and enable macros if necessary. Documents should not be password protected, they should not be formatted as ‘read only’ and printing should be enabled.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>
<p>Ensure you have the owner’s permission and have paid any copyright licence fee before sending in documents.</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all documents have descriptive names, including the type of document you are sending, eg ‘Proposed plan 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Number appendices and submit them as separate documents. Ensure the first page includes the appendix number. Name them to indicate what they form part of, and their sequence eg ‘Appeal statement Appendix 2 Traffic census.’</li>
  <li>Use ‘Part 1’, ‘Part 2’ etc in the file name if you have split up a large document eg ‘Appeal statement in Appendix 1 Environmental Assessment Part 1 of 3’.</li>
  <li>Include the required paper size in the document name for plans and drawings eg ‘Proposed plan A3 size 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Include scale bar(s) on all plans and drawings.</li>
  <li>Do not use a colon ‘:’ in any file names.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scanning</h3>

<p>Ensure documents are complete and legible and avoid scanning more than one document into a single file. Use black and white unless colour is essential.</p>

<h3>Ordnance Survey</h3>

<p>People may only scan an Ordnance Survey map if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an annual licence to make copies; or</li>
  <li>Have purchased a bulk copy arrangement; or</li>
  <li>Are using a local planning authority supplied map under the ‘map return scheme’ (for which a fee is normally payable at the local planning authority’s discretion), or</li>
  <li>Have purchased the site-specific map for the purposes of attaching to a planning application, appeal or representation.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/licensing.html" rel="external">More information on map licensing is available on the Ordnance Survey website</a></p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Send pictures, photographs, plans, maps or drawings as individual files. Avoid the use of bitmap images as they are very large.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks within documents you send to us. Instead, you should download such documents yourself and attach them separately.</li>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks to a website page containing multiple documents or links.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sending emails</h3>

<p>If you send anything by email you should get an automatic acknowledgement, provided it is sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> or to a team email address (which can be found at the top of letters from us about the appeal). If you do not get an automatic acknowledgement, then you should contact us.
For any correspondence which you send to us via email, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quote the appeal reference and/or appellant’s name, site address and local planning authority name in the subject line or in the body of your email.</li>
  <li>If you are attaching more than one document, please list them in the covering email.</li>
  <li>If you are sending a series of emails, include ‘1 of 5’, ‘2 of 5’ etc in the subject line of the email, so we know how many to expect and can check with you if any appear to be missing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you number all pages accordingly.</p>

<h2>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>You and the LPA normally have to meet your own appeal expenses, whether we decide it by the written procedure, a hearing or an inquiry.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them. This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also the Inspector may make an award of costs even if neither of the parties has made an application.</p>

<p>There is <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>If you are making an application for costs you <strong>must</strong> send your costs application <strong>with</strong> your appeal – see Section H.</p>

<p>There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/apply-for-an-award-of-appeal-costs-application-form">model costs application form on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Selecting the correct appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on the ‘Make a new appeal’ button.</p>

<h3>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority. As you type, possible matches will be returned. You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal, with each answer you give determining the next question. You may need to consult your application documents, including any decision issued from your LPA.</p>

<p>Note that you may not necessarily be directed to the appeal form you expect – the definitions for a ‘householder application’ and a ‘householder appeal’ are not an exact match. The form will be correct for the answers you have given however.</p>

<p>A householder appeal would involve works to a single existing residence, whether the LPA has refused permission, refused permission to vary a condition or refused prior approval of permitted development rights. There are some exceptions to this, notably construction of a new dwelling, changes of use and flats/apartments. These exceptions require a standard planning appeal rather than a householder planning appeal.</p>

<p>The LPA’s decision notice should make it clear if it has refused planning permission or if it has refused permission to vary a condition(s) or if it has refused an application for prior approval.</p>

<p>If you are also appealing in relation to an application for listed building consent for the same house, you should use the appropriate appeal form for your householder appeal - as explained above - <strong>and</strong> you should use a listed building consent appeal form.</p>

<p>If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the ‘Restart’ button to begin the appeals process again.</p>

<h3>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage. Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address. This is of particular importance if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h2>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>In this guidance, we use the same section headers as within the householder planning appeal form.</p>

<h3>Appellant Details</h3>

<h4>Name</h4>

<p>Only the person who made the application can make an appeal. If you are the appellant, by responding ‘Yes’, the details registered to your account will be displayed on the form. Select ‘No’ and you will be deemed to be acting as an agent for the appellant and so you should provide the appellant’s details.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.
If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the My Details link at the top of the page.</p>

<h3>Agent Details</h3>

<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your householder planning appeal. If you decide to employ an agent he or she will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent we will send all of our communications to them. We will not send a copy to you. You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements particularly if an “access required” site visit is arranged.</p>

<h4>Preferred contact method</h4>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting ‘No’ to the question ‘Are you the appellant?’ the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h3>Local Planning Authority Details</h3>

<p>This information will usually be in the letter you received from the LPA confirming that your householder application was valid and on the decision notice.</p>

<p>The name of the LPA will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the LPA you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Appeal Site Details</h3>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the householder application.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected land is the same as the appellant’s address then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h4>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h4>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellant’s address you will be asked an additional question as to whether the appeal relates to an existing property. If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h4>Health and safety at the site</h4>

<p>We take seriously our duties with regard to the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work. The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems. Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory. Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site, such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered. Please note that the questions do not actually feature on the appeal form. The information should be supplied within the free text field underneath the Health and Safety question.</p>

<p>1) Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>2) Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site? If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>3) Are there any animals (eg pets or livestock) within the site? If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>ALL</strong> animals (both livestock or pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>4) Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>5) Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access e.g. confined spaces or use of ladders / scaffolding? If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>6) Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site? This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>7) Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, e.g. roof, balcony? Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>8) Are there any site specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>9) Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>10) Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site? If so, you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying him or her.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to the planned site visit date.</p>

<h3>Description of Development</h3>

<p>You need to provide details of the proposed development. This will normally be precisely as you described it on the householder/prior approval application form. However, if during the consideration of your application you have agreed a revised description of the development with the LPA you should use that. Please provide the documents which give details of the revision and which confirm your agreement and the LPA’s agreement to the revision.</p>

<p>If your appeal follows the LPA’s decision to refuse permission to vary or remove a condition(s), please list the condition number(s) your appeal relates to. You can enter this information within the free text box which appears when you have answered the question ‘Has the description of the development changed from that stated on the application form?’</p>

<h4>Area of floor space of proposed development in square metres</h4>

<p>This means that you must include the floor space of each storey of the proposed development and give the total area in square metres.</p>

<h3>Reason for the Appeal</h3>

<p>The reason for the appeal will already be selected as you did this at the start of the process. You will be unable to edit this section as it will be locked down.</p>

<p>The reason will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the reason you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h3>Choice of Procedure</h3>

<p>The vast majority of householder appeals, including those against refusal of prior approval will follow the householder written representations procedure. However, there are 3 possible procedures: written representations, hearings and inquiries. You should consider carefully which suits your circumstances before indicating your preferred procedure.</p>

<p>The householder written representations procedure is normally the simplest, quickest and most straightforward way of making an appeal.</p>

<p>Inspectors give equal attention to every appeal regardless of the procedure. To help you decide which procedure to choose please see the criteria at Annexe 4, which indicate which is likely to be the most suitable procedure.</p>

<p>You may also wish to look at Part 1 of the Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2009, Statutory Instrument 2009/452 which gives detail of the procedure.</p>

<h4>The site visit</h4>

<p><strong>NOTE: No representative from the LPA will attend the site visit. If access to the site is required you may need to be there but solely to allow access to the site.</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of the site visit is to view the site and surroundings in the context of the written material provided on the appeal. No representations will be accepted and no discussion will be permitted at the visit.</p>

<p>We will use your responses to question 1(a) within the <strong>Choice of Procedure</strong> section and the health and safety question within the <strong>Appeal Site Details</strong> section of the appeal form to help us decide how the site visit should be conducted.</p>

<h3>Grounds of Appeal</h3>

<p>Your grounds of appeal should respond directly to the reasons for refusal set out in the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<p>You should read the LPA’s report from its Delegated Officer and the Committee Report for any mention of representations from interested people received during the application stage. Some LPAs publish such representations on their website but not all. The onus is on you to check with the LPA directly whether such representations have been received and if so, to make the necessary arrangements to view them. If you wish to make any comments on such representations you must do so in your grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>The Inspector will look at the planning merits of your proposed householder development afresh, so there is no need to give a detailed history of the application, such as discussions with LPA officers. For appeals against the refusal of prior approval, the Inspector will take account of any objections raised by neighbours during the consultation period (a minimum of 21 days) and will make a decision about whether the impact on the amenity of all adjoining properties is acceptable.</p>

<p>Do not repeat the LPA’s reasons for refusal, but include a clear explanation of why you disagree with each of them. It is not enough to say that you do not accept them – this will not help the Inspector decide your appeal.</p>

<p>You should avoid repetition and information which does not relate to the issues involved. The grounds of appeal should be clear and concise and should not normally exceed 3,000 words.</p>

<p>The reason(s) for refusal will refer to policies in the Development Plan and/or supplementary planning documents as found in the Local Development Framework. Do not describe any local policies in full. Simply give the number and the name of the relevant development plan or supplementary planning document. The LPA will provide the detail for the Inspector.</p>

<p>If you consider it essential to provide email trails to support your grounds of appeal, you should carefully edit the emails to remove repetition so that the key points can be clearly picked up.</p>

<p>Where the effect on the neighbours is a reason for refusal, with their agreement to access, you should include measurements (in metric units) of the distances between your and your neighbours’ properties, particularly the distances to any of their windows. If your neighbours do not allow you access to their property you should provide approximate measurements.</p>

<p>You may include details of similar developments in the immediate area if you think these are relevant to what you are proposing. You should identify them on a street map and supply their addresses and, where possible, photographs of them. Where you are aware of the history of any such development you should set it out briefly in your grounds of appeal or in a separate annexe.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to attach previous LPA or appeal decisions relevant to the site. If you are aware of any appeals made by other people relating to the site or for nearby sites, please provide details – including the appeal reference number or the site address.</p>

<p>If you think there are other relevant policies, not referred to in the LPA’s decision but on which you intend to rely, you should attach the relevant extracts to your appeal. You should indicate their status, i.e. whether they have been adopted by the LPA and, where appropriate, whether they have been saved by a direction of the Secretary of State and form part of the Local Development Framework.</p>

<p>There is no need to set out national policy (such as the National Planning Policy Framework) as Inspectors have access to these documents. However, you should refer to any paragraphs by number that you think are relevant.</p>

<p>Please see Annexe C of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>
for additional guidance about grounds of appeal.</p>

<h4>Supporting documentation</h4>

<p>Any supporting documentation, other than that listed in the Supporting Documents section, should be kept to a minimum and be essential and directly relevant to the appeal. Such documentation should be clearly cross-referenced in the grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>You may provide appendices to your grounds of appeal. These can include reports and information that relate directly to the reasons for refusal and any issues that are in dispute. Appendices should be used sparingly. Do not send copies of the Delegated Officer’s Report, the Committee Report, or other documents sent to the LPA, such as consultation responses and letters from interested people, as the LPA will provide these.</p>

<p>You may use photographs (preferably colour) to illustrate your grounds of appeal – e.g. to show your house and its relationship to its neighbours. If you send photographs, you must give details of where they were taken on a map showing the viewpoints, and when and what they show. If you take photographs in public places, please take reasonable care to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may inadvertently capture.</p>

<h4>Conditions</h4>

<p>You should indicate if you wish to accept or can suggest a planning condition(s) that you think would mitigate the impact of the proposal.</p>

<p>You should look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/use-of-planning-conditions">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a> on the use of planning conditions and</li>
  <li>Appendix A – “Suggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstances” (which is still in existence) to Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission (which has been cancelled).</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that conditions are suggested does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h3>Audio/Video</h3>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>However, you may send a written summary which you should attach.</p>

<h4>Costs Applications</h4>

<p>If you are making an application for <strong>costs</strong> you should indicate this as required when making your appeal and you must send your costs application, supported by a full statement of why you think an award is justified, <strong>with</strong> your appeal.</p>

<p>Please attach your costs application as a separate document to the grounds of appeal.
Your grounds of appeal should be in full, as there will be <strong>no</strong> opportunity to add to them at a later stage.</p>

<h3>Site Ownership Certificates</h3>

<p>As we need to know who owns the appeal site you must complete a site ownership certificate. “Owner” means a person having a:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>freehold interest; or</li>
  <li>a leasehold interest with 7 years or more to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you knowingly or recklessly sign an ownership certificate which contains any statement which is false or misleading, you are committing an offence and would be liable to a fine if convicted.</p>

<h4>Certificate A</h4>

<p>If you own <strong>the whole appeal site</strong> you should tick <strong>Certificate A</strong>. You can now go to the Agricultural Holdings section.</p>

<h4>Other certificates and giving notice</h4>

<p>If you <strong>do not own the whole appeal site</strong> you must inform all the owners of the land that you are going to make an appeal. We call this “serving notice”. You must serve notice on the person (or people) who <strong>owned the land on the day 21 days before the day you send your appeal form to us</strong>. You must do this during the 21 days immediately before, or on the day, you send your appeal to us.</p>

<h4>Serving notice</h4>

<p>In Annexe 1 is the form you must use to serve notice on all other owners and any tenant of an agricultural holding.
You can:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>cut and paste this notice; or</li>
  <li>type your own version that must contain exactly the same wording.</li>
</ul>

<h4>What you must do with the notice</h4>

<p>If you <strong>do not own</strong> the appeal site or <strong>do not own all of it</strong> and you know the names and addresses of <strong>all</strong> or <strong>some</strong> of the other owner(s) you must serve the notice on the owners that you do know. You must do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>handing the notice personally to them; or</li>
  <li>by leaving it at the usual or last known place of abode of that person or, in a case where an address for service has been given by that person, at that address; or</li>
  <li>sending the notice by registered or recorded delivery post; or</li>
  <li>in a case where an address for service using electronic communications has been given by that person, by sending it using electronic communications.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it appears that the land is unoccupied, if you have not been given an address for the service of notice for some or all of the other owners you may address the notice to “the owners and any occupiers” and fix the notice conspicuously to some object on the land.</p>

<p>If you have to serve notice on an organisation you must address it to the secretary or clerk of the organisation at their registered or principal office.</p>

<h4>Certificate B</h4>

<p>If you know the names and addresses of <strong>all</strong> the owners of the appeal site and you have served notice on them you should tick and complete <strong>Certificate B</strong> on the householder planning appeal form.</p>

<p>Please click the ‘Add this person’ button to ensure that the details you have entered upload. You then have the option to add further owners by selecting ‘Add Another’.</p>

<p>You can now go to the Agricultural Holdings section.</p>

<h4>Certificate C</h4>

<p>If you <strong>know the names and addresses of some, but not all</strong> of the owners of the land involved in the appeal, you must serve notice on the owners that you do know about – see above. Also you must publish the notice in a local newspaper. This is so that any other owners may become aware of your intention to appeal. You must send a copy of the published notice to us with your appeal.</p>

<p>In these circumstances you should complete <strong>Certificate C</strong> given in Annexe 2 within this guidance.
You must send us a copy of the completed Certificate C, and the notice as published, with your householder appeal form.</p>

<p>You can now go to the Agricultural Holdings section.</p>

<h4>Certificate D</h4>

<p>If you <strong>do not know the names and addresses of the owners</strong> of the land involved in the appeal you must publish the notice in a local newspaper.</p>

<p>In these circumstances you should complete <strong>Certificate D</strong>, given in Annexe 3 within this guidance.
You must send us a copy of the completed Certificate D, and the notice as published, with your householder appeal form.</p>

<p>You can now go to the Agricultural Holdings section.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Holdings</h3>

<p>We need to know if the appeal site forms part of an agricultural holding. If it does not you should select option (a).</p>

<p>If part or all of the appeal site is an agricultural holding and there is a tenant, you must also serve notice on the tenant. You must do this during the 21 days immediately before, or on the day, you send your appeal to us.</p>

<p>S1(1) of the 1986 Agricultural Holdings Act defines an agricultural holding to mean the aggregate of the land (whether agricultural land or not) comprised in a contract of tenancy which is a contract for an agricultural tenancy. Whether a contract is that of an agricultural tenancy is determined by reference to the terms of the tenancy, the actual or contemplated use of the land and ‘any other relevant circumstances.’ However, the substantial use of the whole should be agricultural. So, if most of the land comprised in the tenancy agreement is let for use as agricultural land it will be an agricultural holding and protected under the legislation.</p>

<p>Land can only qualify as agricultural land protected by the 1986 Act if it is used for agriculture and is so used for the purposes of a trade or business.</p>

<p>“Tenant” means a tenant of an agricultural holding any part of which is part of the appeal site.</p>

<p>If you have selected (b)(ii) and have entered details of a tenant, please click the ‘Add this person’ button to ensure that the details upload. You then have the option to add further tenants by selecting ‘Add another’.</p>

<h3>Supporting Documents</h3>

<p><strong>You must send a copy of the planning application form or the application for prior approval and a copy of the LPA’s decision to us with your householder planning appeal form. Do not send plans, the LPA will provide these.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If your appeal follows the LPA’s decision to refuse permission to vary a condition(s), please provide a copy of the original permission.</strong> You should attach it along with a copy of the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<p>If we do not receive all your essential appeal documents by the end of the appeal period we will not be able to proceed with it and you will lose your right to appeal. We do not ‘chase’ missing documents so make sure you have sent us everything; if not your appeal will be delayed or possibly turned away.</p>

<p>The Inspector will normally only consider the documents and plans which were put before and considered by the LPA. However, if there has been a change in circumstance since the LPA decided the application which is directly relevant to the consideration of the appeal, you should tell us what has changed.</p>

<h3>Other Appeals</h3>

<p>If you have made any other appeals (including appeals against enforcement notices) which are awaiting a decision for this site or for nearby sites, please supply the reference numbers. Where practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related cases together.</p>

<h2>Submitting your appeal</h2>

<p>You must read this section carefully and then check the box to confirm you have read the content. To find out more about how we use and manage your personal data, please go to our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-inspectorate-privacy-notices">privacy notice</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that we <strong>must receive</strong> your appeal form, any application for an award of costs and <strong>all</strong> supporting documents within the 12 weeks or 28 days time limit. So please make sure that you send your appeal in good time before the time limit.</p>

<p><strong>At the same time, you must send a copy of the appeal form and all supporting documents, including your grounds of appeal that were not part of your planning application, or your application for prior approval, and any application for costs to the LPA.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Further instructions on how to send the documents to the LPA are within the confirmation of appeal email which you will receive upon successful submission of your appeal form.</strong></p>

<h3>Annexe 4: Criteria for determining the procedure for planning, listed buildings, enforcement, hazardous substances, advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals</h3>

<p><strong>The criteria for each procedure cannot be fully prescriptive or entirely determinative: they require judgement to be applied using common sense. More than one criterion may apply.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Written representations</strong> - written representations would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning issues raised or, in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, can be clearly understood from the appeal documents and a site inspection (if required - A small number of appeals do not require a site visit and can be dealt with solely on the basis of the appeal documents); or</li>
  <li>the issues are not complex and the Inspector is not likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify any other matters; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are clear.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong> - a hearing would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Inspector is likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify matters (For example, where detailed evidence on housing land supply needs to be tested by questioning); or</li>
  <li>the status or personal circumstances of the appellant are at issue (For example whether in traveller appeals the definition in Annex 1 of DLUHC’s planning policy for traveller sites is met); or</li>
  <li>there is no need for evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate or given on oath; or</li>
  <li>the case has generated a level of local interest such as to warrant a hearing; or</li>
  <li>it can reasonably be expected that the parties will be able to present their own cases (supported by professional witnesses if required) without the need for an advocate to represent them; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> - an inquiry would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a clearly explained need for the evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate (This does not preclude an appellant representing themselves as an advocate); or</li>
  <li>the issues are complex (For example, where large amounts of highly technical data are likely to be provided in evidence); or</li>
  <li>the appeal has generated substantial local interest to warrant an inquiry as opposed to dealing with the case by a hearing; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, evidence needs to be given on oath (For example where witnesses are giving factual evidence about how long the alleged unauthorised use has been taking place); or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the alleged breach, or the requirements of the notice, are unusual and particularly contentious.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - It is considered that the prospect of legal submissions being made is not, on its own, a reason why a case would need to be conducted by inquiry. Where a party considers that legal submissions will be required (and are considered to be complex such as to warrant being made orally), the Inspectorate requires that the matters on which submissions will be made are fully explained – including why they may require an inquiry - at the outset of the appeal or otherwise at the earliest opportunity.</p>
