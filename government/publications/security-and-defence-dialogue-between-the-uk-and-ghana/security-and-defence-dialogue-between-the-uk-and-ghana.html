<h2>Serious and organised crime</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana commit to further strengthen the collaboration between our governments and law enforcement agencies to counter the threat that serious and organised crime and organised criminal gangs pose to both countries by addressing the drivers and enablers of criminality and disrupting their business models.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana commit to further deepen collaboration to disrupt the <abbr title="serious organised crime">SOC</abbr> criminals and networks which impose highest harm, and to reduce vulnerabilities of individuals, businesses and communities to exploitation from <abbr title="serious organised crime">SOC</abbr> criminals and networks, including through the delivery of new UK programming aimed at tackling illicit financial flows – including the management and return of criminal assets – and cybercrime.</p>

<p>Given the prioritisation of transnational Organised Crime in Ghana’s national security strategy, the United Kingdom commits to providing support to Ghana to develop its strategic framework, including through the implementation of the new asset recovery and management policy framework and narcotics master plan.</p>

<p>In order to increase disruptions of the trafficking of drugs, the UK will continue to support relevant Ghanaian law enforcement agencies, including <abbr title="Narcotics Control Commission">NACOC</abbr>. Ghana will further enhance agencies’ ability to operate by ensuring full access to <abbr title="World Customs Organization Cargo Targeting System">WCO CTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Integrated Customs Management System">ICUMS</abbr> and allowing for joint inspection rights at Tema Port.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana reaffirm our shared commitment to achieving progress on shared illicit financial flow outcomes to cement Ghana’s removal from the <abbr title="Financial Action Task Force">FATF</abbr> grey list.</p>

<p>The UK commits to exploring how GoAML can be integrated more effectively across the Ghanaian law enforcement system. The United Kingdom and Ghana recognise the challenges presented by unregulated and illegal gold-mining, and the United Kingdom will start a new programme of support to build community resilience against the <abbr title="serious organised crime">SOC</abbr> and stability related risks presented by this.</p>

<h2>Border management and migration</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana recognise that although our countries face different border challenges, there is much to be learned from each other. We commit to maintaining our law enforcement collaboration to protect our borders and strive to mitigate the corrupt practices which undermine them.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana affirm our cooperation on shared commitment to the effective management of migration and travel between our two countries. The UK will continue to work closely with Ghana immigration service including skills towards data analysis to improve border security. UK agrees to work closely with GIS on immigration matters particularly on deportation to allow GIS to prepare adequately to reintegrate Ghanaian deportees.</p>

<h2>Conflict prevention and addressing the drivers of insecurity and instability</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana recognise the increasing proximity of instability to Ghana’s borders and the risk this presents to Ghana – particularly in the northern zone – and West Africa. The United Kingdom and Ghana acknowledge the importance of civilian-led security and civil-military cooperation in maintaining stability in border areas and giving a platform for development.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana agree to work together in support of Ghana’s efforts to institutionalise integrated economic and human development, good governance, peacebuilding and civil-military cooperation within Ghana’s planning and response, in support of Ghana’s national security strategy, with a closer working relationship between the Ministry of National Security and relevant UK staff.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana will increase cooperation in the areas of community policing, community conflict resolution, and support to the coordination of economic development efforts through the Northern Development Authority. The UK will continue to support large and broad ranging development assistance programmes, and will work with international partners to increase engagement with the ‘softer interventions’ and human security approaches set out in the national security strategy.</p>

<p>The UK agrees to support Ghana’s counter-terrorism initiatives by providing avenues to ensure that vulnerable communities become resilient to conflict and the causes of violent extremism.</p>

<h2>Countering terrorism and violent extremism</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana reaffirm our commitment to work together to respond to the shared threat of violent extremism and terrorism. In support of this commitment the United Kingdom will share experience of delivering a multi-agency approach in response to terrorist incidents, including to work with Ghana to identify vulnerabilities in strategic sites and sharing best practice.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom will share experience on preventing radicalisation and violent extremism and taking intelligence led and evidence-based approaches. The United Kingdom will support Ghana in preventing terrorist use of the internet, and working to mitigate the risks of prisons being used for radicalisation.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom will share insight on terrorist financing, trans-border movements and the illegal movement of small arms and light weapons.</p>

<p>The UK will continue to support aviation security at Kotoka International Airport and will explore how to support increased protection of maritime architecture.</p>

<h2>Cyber</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana recognise the importance and opportunity to engage on cyber. The United Kingdom and Ghana commit to agreeing the scope of a cyber work programme, grounded in capability needs assessment and eco-system analysis of relevant Ghanaian bodies.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom will support Ghana to raise levels of cyber awareness for citizens and institutions, with a focus on areas of greatest harm to mutual interests and explore potential collaboration for developing <abbr title="small to medium enterprise">SME</abbr> toolkits. The UK and Ghana will work together to build capacity in specific agreed areas.</p>

<h2>Military cooperation</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana reaffirm the longstanding and deep relationship between our armed forces, and commit to expanding existing defence cooperation and partnership for mutually agreed critical areas.</p>

<h2>Regional security</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana share concern at the increase of violent incidents, attacks and insurgency in West Africa. The United Kingdom will support efforts to achieve regional solutions to these threats, recognising that instability does not recognise borders.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom will support Ghana to galvanise international support for regional initiatives such as the Accra Initiative, and ensure that support for such initiatives is coordinated and coherent. Ghana will work with other countries under the Accra Initiative to ensure that UK support is aligned appropriately.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The United Kingdom and Ghana commit to integrating the commitment made through this dialogue into workplans, reviewed through a working group structure meeting quarterly, and to agree future cooperation at the next security dialogue, which we will aim to hold in summer 2023. This dialogue will involve all relevant ministries, departments and agencies from both governments.</p>
