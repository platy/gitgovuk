<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Foreword</h2>

<p>“Management is doing things right, and leadership is doing the right things.”</p>

<p>Governing is a Team Sport. From the trust established between ministers and their officials, to effective problem-solving and public service improvement between national policy and local delivery teams, no public servant is an island.</p>

<p>It’s never been more important to invest in the shared knowledge and expertise of our current and future leaders and managers. Accomplishing the government’s plans for renewal – recovering lost ground in education, justice, and health; forging a new place for the United Kingdom on the world stage; levelling up across the country; and speeding progress to net zero – requires teams equipped for shared mission and excellence, not just expert individuals.</p>

<p>In recent years our Civil Service and public servants have been tested in conditions of immense pressure, and have delivered at pace and scale. The growth of our workforce was necessary for those exceptional times – unprecedented in recent history. The challenge now is to remain responsive and effective as the leaner Civil Service that we were in 2016. We are doing this by focusing on skills, ambition, and innovation – from embracing new technologies to upgrading our training and putting data and science at the heart of our work.</p>

<p>For the first time in the Civil Service’s proud history we have one curriculum, and one skills Campus. They explain and provide what people need to know and do, to excel in everything from the foundations of public administration to the most specialist technical professions.</p>

<p>Leadership and management is a key strand of the curriculum. It defines precisely what the government and country requires of senior teams, and gives long overdue parity of status to the different, but vital, leader and manager roles. I am delighted that the new Leadership College for Government will be a vanguard within the Campus: multi-site; UK-wide; both physical and virtual. It will equip our colleagues with the knowledge, skills, networks, and shared tools to tackle the challenges of the present day and the future.</p>

<p>This prospectus defines the College’s initial offer and why our approach to growing leadership and management skills must change. It sets out new responses to our long-term problems: the College’s initial programme of work is the first waypoint in what will be a lengthy, important journey.</p>

<p>With greater investment in our collective training and development, I am confident that we will embrace the challenges to come.</p>

<p>Simon Case</p>

<p>Cabinet Secretary</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Civil Service has always adapted to better serve the public in increasingly complex environments. To better prepare teams, leaders, and managers with the skills, knowledge and networks they need to provide the services on which people rely, we are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>setting high, clear standards for all management and leadership development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>providing universal products and accelerated development interventions for all grades</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reforming and better integrating our talent and management programmes, including our offer to public sector leaders</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this prospectus, we explain why we’re making these changes and what you can expect to see. At the centre of our work is a new organisation: the Leadership College for Government.</p>

<p>The new College integrates and replaces the previously disconnected portfolio of training and schemes for leaders and managers. It will offer practical training and development for everyone from first time managers to experienced leaders, building high performing teams not just skilled individuals. We need to deepen and broaden our collective knowledge and capabilities, emphasising the skills needed for modern government. We will ensure equal status between the qualities of good leaders and good managers. We will invest in leaders and managers to “pay it forward” to the next generation, ensuring a resilient and high performing permanent institution.</p>

<p>All of this will be done in partnership with departments, functions, professions and colleagues across the public sector. Our offer will enhance rather than duplicate, making it easier for people to know and get what they need, when they need it.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: our leaders</h4>

<p>“I really value that the Civil Service differentiates between leadership and management and invests in development and training in both areas to ensure that we have the tools to excel in our roles.</p>

<p>“As a senior civil servant, I’m looking forward to seeing training that focuses on strategy and collaboration. A curriculum that supports new and experienced line managers not only at the point of need but that builds on leadership and management skills in advance is very much welcomed.”</p>

<p>Annelies Look, Programme Director Rail Transformation, Department for Transport</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>The new Leadership College for Government</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Our purpose</h3>

<p>The new Leadership College for Government sits within the new Government Campus for skills. It is the physical and virtual place for Civil Service and public sector leaders to learn with and from their peers and world-leading experts. The syllabus and programmes it offers will be based on <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/collections/the-government-campus-curriculum">the government campus curriculum</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/government-campus-evaluation-strategy">the campus evaluation strategy</a> to ensure consistency, relevance, and high quality.</p>

<p>Our current and future managers and leaders need familiarity with, and mastery of, the knowledge and skills to do their jobs. The new curriculum defines these and provides the training required. The College is also the place where people can find out about what else is on offer to prepare them for future roles, across the Campus. It will help people choose what training or development programme, within the Civil Service or externally, will be most valuable for their impact, from the Major Projects Leadership Academy, to the new OpDel Excel, to the College for National Security.</p>

<p>Learning and developing together will establish a collective leadership community, with better connections and understanding across boundaries. We are encouraging civil servants to work in and learn from the private sector and civil society, and vice versa, transferring valuable skills, knowledge and expertise. Supported by partners in business and academia, we will ensure our offer delivers the capabilities needed and value for money for taxpayers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Our aims</h3>

<p>We will help civil servants and their public sector counterparts to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understand what they need to know to be an effective leader and manager, what quality, relevant programmes are available and how to access them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>form deep and broad professional networks and teams across the Union, as well as the public, private, and social sectors, to share knowledge and break down barriers between central and local, policy and delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>access a variety of practical, evidenced-based knowledge and insights, covering areas like digital, data-driven decision making, and inclusive leadership</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learn using structured, active learning techniques such as case method, simulation, debate, and briefing practice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ready and equipped to “pay it forward”, building the capability of their colleagues and the next generation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For civil servants, this means a clear, precise leadership and management syllabus, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a new programme for future directors general and permanent secretaries</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4 new management training programmes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>digital and data masterclasses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a comprehensive Senior Civil Service (SCS) induction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a universal curriculum available to all SCS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>quality assured secondment, exchange and shadowing opportunities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reformed accelerated development schemes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increased opportunities for secondments and exchanges to share expertise and build confidence, inclusion and curiosity to tackle complex problems in new ways</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Spotlight on: case method</h4>

<p>Case method is an approach used by the world’s leading executive education programmes. It is a structured discipline for team learning and development, with a strong evidence base. Case method uses complex real world situations to build deep and broad knowledge, skills, qualities, and frameworks for systems thinking and problem solving. When expertly facilitated, and delivered as part of a varied programme over time, it encourages individual and group growth, reflection, and understanding.</p>

<p>For example, using a past public policy challenge or incident, small groups will acquire deep contextual insights into the situation, and each other. They might question and hear from those directly involved, and reflect afterwards, or take on personas for <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/a-guide-to-red-teaming">Red Team challenge sessions</a>. Intrinsically, people acquire a better understanding of history, lessons from success and failure, and different perspectives. Instrumentally, individuals and teams reflect on ethics, leadership styles, changing cultures, and much more.</p>

<p>Case method is suited to the goal and purpose of the new Leadership College for Government, integrating a previously disparate suite of programmes, and focusing on developing teams. A bank of professionally written cases will be adapted for many different programmes, suited to the level and range of delegates. A faculty of trained case method facilitators will ensure quality, relevance, and impact across our portfolio.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Our approach</h3>

<p>The Leadership College for Government will be focused on shared mission, and improving lives. Our programmes will be rigorous and transparent, and continuously evaluated for impact and value Union-wide.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: Systems Leadership</h4>

<p>How can systems thinking help you understand policy problems?</p>

<p>Matthew Vick, a team leader for Counter-Avoidance Policy Development in HM Revenue and Customs explains:</p>

<p>“Most policy problems occur within a complex system, with multiple stakeholders, multiple drivers, possibly, not very obvious causal or linear effects. Systems thinking offers a way of framing that difficult policy situation, offering a way of managing that uncertainty and complexity, to break problems down into discrete chunks.”</p>

<p>How can systems thinking help policy professionals?</p>

<p>Emma Miles, Group Director of Strategy at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says:</p>

<p>“The whole point of systems thinking is that you think about things in relationship to each other. If you try and separate out a problem and just deal with a part of it, and you don’t think about it in the context of its whole, you’re going to be solving the wrong problem.</p>

<p>“…You have to do systems analysis so you can understand the effects of what you’re doing, in its context.”</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>The case for change</h3>

<p>In 2020 we reviewed the range of leadership programmes on offer, and the history of their evolution. We asked current and former course participants for their feedback. We looked at international leaders in executive education and government capability-building, and talked to counterparts in academia and the private sector. For more details please see Annex C: the history and evidence pack.</p>

<p>We need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>to streamline the multiple routes and interventions available that are difficult to navigate and not clearly linked to supply and demand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a clear and common purpose across our different leadership and management interventions. And a better balance between individual development needs and organisational capability requirements and standards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to fill the gaps in our current offer, including people management at the executive level, and ensure that our products are consistently high quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more training opportunities to develop new and emerging skills like big data analysis, physical sciences, hybrid working and the future of work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to build a better connected leadership community that takes a systems approach to solving complex policy and delivery problems. It will encourage movement, learning and skills transfer across the public and private sectors and civil society. The community will support experienced leaders to join from outside the Civil Service and civil servants to spend time in other sectors, bringing skills back into the Civil Service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to foster a genuine commitment to continuous learning and development in our organisations, using real life experiences and evidenced-based design.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>better information about how we spend taxpayers’ money on training and development, and better evaluation of its impact on organisational objectives and personal development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>better functional expertise in our top tiers of leadership.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more mainstreamed content on diversity, inclusion and wellbeing to ensure inclusive behaviours are at the heart of leadership and management in our organisations rather than a “nice-to-have” add-on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to work with departments to establish a shared view of what we expect from our people, build professional capabilities and transfer learning from different fields.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The new Leadership College is designed to address these needs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Our new leadership and management curriculum</h3>

<p>With support from a wide network of colleagues and external experts we have developed new educational standards (see Annex A) with 3 foundational pillars, 7 core areas of capability, and a curriculum. This explains the expectations of the leadership and management skills needed at every stage of a Civil Service career. They also provide a useful resource for the wider public sector, and business, to make it easier for people to transfer into government roles, on secondment or otherwise.</p>

<p>Completing a course or training programme does not guarantee high performance as a leader or manager, of course. Progression remains a performance in role conversation. We hope the Leadership College will support departments, professions, functions in designing consistent and fair assessment, and help individuals to be the author of their own career pathway.</p>

<p>Each course on the curriculum will be founded on these 7 core areas, grouped into 3 pillars:</p>

<p>3 pillars</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pillar 1: Performance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pillar 2: People</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pillar 3: Partnerships</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>7 core areas of leadership and management</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy, systems, and culture: strategic systems leadership that connects our work to citizens’ outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Business and risk: prioritising and managing operational, financial, and people resources and organisational objectives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technology and data-driven decision making: working in multidisciplinary teams and using appropriate digital and data skills to innovate and solve problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developing self and others: proactively taking responsibility for developing self and others, creating a continuous learning culture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Innovation and transformation: driving change, leading through uncertainty, and bringing new ways of thinking to delivering positive citizen outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicating purposefully: harnessing the appropriate channels, platforms, and styles to communicate clearly and concisely to different audiences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working in teams: creating collaborative, inclusive environments that safeguard wellbeing and support new and flexible ways of working</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>For all civil servants it will mean:</h4>

<p>A clear understanding of leadership and management in the Civil Service, from the moment you join us. You can look forward to a great induction, high quality management training available for every grade, and support to develop the right skills, knowledge and networks throughout your career, learning from peers, colleagues and world experts.</p>

<p>Our selective leadership programmes will be complemented by a universal offering and open-access content for self-directed learning. We are designing this in partnership with departments, professions, and functions to make sure this enhances, not duplicates, what is available.</p>

<p>Our training and development opportunities will give you the tools you need to develop your personal leadership and management skills. You will improve delivery and become part of an effective public sector leadership network.</p>

<h4>For public servants it will mean:</h4>

<p>Our activities and partnerships will help you continually refresh your skills, so you can better support staff, delivery priorities and the public. We will offer opportunities to enhance your skills and knowledge, drawing on real world experience, insight from subject matter experts, and existing leadership programmes and academies aimed at public sector leaders.</p>

<p>You will enjoy an active community of committed public leaders to draw on for support, inspiration, and the confidence to enhance your careers by developing a clearer understanding of the challenges and operations across the public sector and beyond.</p>

<h4>Something for everyone:</h4>

<p>The Leadership College for Government will be a place to find our whole leadership and management offer, which you can access virtually and physically in government and public sector partner estates. A central hub will support a network of partnerships with academies and public sector bodies across the country. Over time, we aim to have permanent delivery partnerships in place all across the Union.</p>

<p>We are very focused on enhancing, not duplicating, existing leadership and management support. And this is not limited to what the Civil Service provides for its staff. We will continue to work with private companies, universities, and other public sector organisations to make sure the Leadership College focuses on what it can provide uniquely and most effectively. We want to help people navigate the offers and make an informed choice about what’s best for them.</p>

<p>See Annex B for what the new leadership and management curriculum includes at a glance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Management pathways</h2>

<p>Management is a long undervalued skill. We are championing good management as a core capability essential to getting the best out of thousands of dedicated civil servants.</p>

<p>The operational delivery profession makes up one of the early adopter groups, and we will be working with learners to capture their feedback on the programme. We will work with more professions and functions to develop our other programmes over the coming months, both as early adopter test groups and to design content of the programmes.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: our leaders</h4>

<p>“When I first became a manager, I received mentoring from experienced managers and also attended some ad hoc workshops.</p>

<p>“I’ve logged on to Civil Service Learning before but struggled to find suitable leadership training that is relevant for me. I’m particularly keen to develop my skills in collaborating remotely with others.”</p>

<p>Adedayo Adebesin, Prison Custodial Manager (operational delivery)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Who it is for</h3>

<p>Our new leadership and management curriculum, structured in 4 programmes or “pathways”, is part of our universal offer. It will be available to all civil servants. The new offer will provide managers at all grades with the knowledge and skills they need as individuals and to deliver through their teams.</p>

<p>The modules will provide blended training with workshops and engaging content, such as animations, podcasts, digital learning and videos, as well as opportunities for peer learning and building networks within a hybrid learning model. The 4 tiers will not be aligned to grades. Instead, they allow people to access training at the point of need and undertake learning based on their individual experience and on-the-job requirements. An example of what managers can expect from the new pathways is set out below.</p>

<h4>Choosing the right pathway for you</h4>

<p>Rather than relying on grade structures as a crude indicator, our new 4-tier leadership and management offer for all civil servants will provide targeted, modular content and guided self assessment to point users towards the best training pathways for them.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>A grade 7 policy officer who is new to line management would benefit from the Foundation level.</p>

<p>An executive officer who is an experienced line manager would choose to top up their skills at the Practitioner level.</p>

<p>A new entrant senior executive officer with no line management responsibility would be directed to Personal Effectiveness courses to start their leadership journey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Indicative programme structure</h3>

<p>The new Foundation pathway will have a 4-month duration with 16 participants per cohort. It will include the following.</p>

<p>Virtual or face to face launch event</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>introducing your programme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>introducing your peers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>building your networks.</p>
  </li>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Timeline</h3>

<p>We launched the early adopter groups of our first pathway, the Foundation Programme, in May 2022. The Practitioner, Personal Effectiveness and Senior Practitioner programmes will follow on a rolling basis over Summer and Autumn 2022. The pathways will be tested thoroughly with Civil Service managers, ensuring that a rigorous, up-to-date, high quality management training offer is fully accessible to all civil servants by 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Accelerated development schemes</h2>

<p>Our selective schemes develop high-potential individuals and build a robust and diverse pipeline to senior roles. Today’s complex challenges mean it’s time to improve our offer for a modern Civil Service.</p>

<p>The reform of our programmes starts with a new selective programme for Director-level (SCS2) leaders, due to launch in Winter 2022. We also provide a selective programme for Deputy Director (SCS1) leaders, called the Senior Leaders Scheme, and one for Grade 6 and 7 leaders, called the Future Leaders Scheme.</p>

<p>These programmes will develop participants’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ability to harness the power of multidisciplinary teams</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of contemporary government priorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>essential skills including digital, data-driven decision making and systems thinking</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The programmes will also offer opportunities to build meaningful networks across different sectors. Participants will engage directly with communities across the Union and the issues they face in pursuit of better policy making and delivery.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Who it is for</h3>

<p>The first cohort for the new Directors programme will welcome up to 30 people. The selection process for the new programme will launch in Summer 2022.</p>

<p>The Senior Leaders Scheme (SLS) is aimed at deputy directors (SCS1) who have the potential to progress to more senior roles.</p>

<p>The Future Leaders Scheme (FLS) is aimed at grade 6 and 7 civil servants with the potential to progress to the SCS.</p>

<p>As part of the FLS and SLS, we also offer our Minority Ethnic Talent Association programme to successful candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds and Disability Empowers Leadership Talent Association to successful candidates with disabilities.</p>

<p>Centrally-provided training for lower grades will also be refreshed in line with the new educational standards. We will build on the existing Future Leaders and Personal Leadership Academies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Indicative programme structure: Director (SCS2) programme</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Programme timeline</h3>

<p>Selections for the next SLS and FLS cohorts will be completed in Summer 2022. The selection process for the new SCS2 programme is opening in June 2022.</p>

<p>The new Director programme is due to launch in Winter 2022. We will then use this as the template for refreshing our other accelerated development schemes, the Senior Leaders Scheme (SLS) and the Future Leaders Scheme (FLS), in 2023.</p>

<p>FLS and SLS programme launch events will be held in Q1 2023.</p>

<p>All participants in existing cohorts on the SLS and FLS will continue on their current programmes uninterrupted.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: our leaders</h4>

<p>“The residentials really challenge your personal leadership style and provide some quality reflection time to think through strengths and areas you want to improve. In these tricky, demanding times in light of COVID-19, I know this can be challenging, but finding the time to invest in you and your participation in the scheme will bring long term dividends for you/your career.”</p>

<p>Leanne Almond, SLS participant 2019</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>SCS induction offers</h2>

<p>It is vital that we help new colleagues in the Civil Service get off to a strong start. We know that when individuals join the SCS they really appreciate developing a network quickly and benefit from having the opportunity to explore, in a safe space, what is expected of them as senior leaders and managers.</p>

<p>The new induction will also play a part in building a stronger, more diverse community of Civil Service leaders supported with the skills, knowledge and networks that they need to succeed in their new roles and in the best interests of the public.</p>

<p>Our refreshed induction for SCS will be an introduction for newly promoted deputy directors and directors and a bespoke offer for new entrants from outside the Civil Service.</p>

<p>The new Civil Service Orientation (CSO) programme addresses the need, originally identified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="government/publications/baxendale-report-how-to-best-attract-induct-and-retain-talent-recruited-into-the-senior-civil-service">Baxendale Report</a>, to tackle historical problems of dissatisfaction among external hires and increase the retention of skilled, experienced senior leaders.</p>

<p>Externally recruited SCS will receive a bespoke induction to understand the context of government, demystify the Civil Service and provide attendees with the knowledge and professional networks they need to succeed in their new environment.</p>

<p>The CSO will function as a primer for mid-career switchers, so they have relevant Civil Service knowledge, and create a level playing field by helping them attain a similar level of understanding of the Civil Service as their internally promoted peers.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: our leaders</h4>

<p>“My key takeaway is the wealth of information that is out there and a recognition that I am not using this as effectively as I could do. Clarifying things like roles and jargon is all really useful. Some of it was already known, but when covered in totality like this, it is really helpful to build on existing knowledge.”</p>

<p>Laura Adams-Foskett, Director of Transformation, Ministry of Defence, February 2022 CSO participant</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Who it is for</h3>

<p>The SCS induction offer will consist of 3 products:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Civil Service Orientation for external hires</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Director Induction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deputy Director Induction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Internally promoted SCS will go straight onto their grade-specific induction in cohorts of up to 20 participants. The aim is for all new-to-grade deputy directors and directors across the Civil Service to attend their grade-specific induction within the first 2 months of starting in the role.</p>

<p>New colleagues joining from outside the Civil Service will first attend the CSO, before taking up a place on the broader induction with their new director or deputy director peers, giving them the opportunity to develop as a leader alongside their new Civil Service colleagues.</p>

<p>For SCS who have been in post for some time, an improved universal offer will be designed to help you gain the skills, knowledge, and networks you need to be as effective as possible at your current grade.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Indicative programme structure</h3>

<p>Key features of the new approach will include online modules at times to suit participants, which provide essential Civil Service knowledge needed to operate effectively, and an SCS buddy from their preference of profession or organisation. Every session closes with a face-to-face event, offering the opportunity to meet peers at a Government Campus location and undertake development sessions that work best in person.</p>

<h4>Outline for the Civil Service Orientation programme,</h4>

<p>It will be 2 weeks in duration, with 30 participants per cohort.</p>

<p>Virtual launch event: introducing your programme, and a welcome from a guest speaker.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Programme timeline</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/learning-events-calendar">Both induction programmes and orientations are live and available to book on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>Induction courses run for a period of 2 weeks and will be available to join at least twice a quarter, depending on demand. The new Civil Service Orientation programme will also be delivered twice a quarter to ensure the maximum number of externally-hired SCS receive an effective induction at the right time.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Public sector leaders</h2>

<p>Many of our leadership programmes, activities, and events bring civil servants and their wider public sector colleagues together. We aim to help leaders become more adaptive, connected, informed and empowered so they can lead their organisations and better serve citizens across the country.</p>

<p>The new campus and Leadership College will help leaders to strengthen their leadership community. We will create a connected environment that takes a systems approach, facilitates skills transfer and encourages greater movement between services.</p>

<p>Embedded in the public sector community, we work with a wide range of partners and leadership academies on common topics, sharing expertise and feedback. The Leadership College will enhance, not duplicate, what is on offer for leaders.</p>

<p>Our events and activities will include specific skills development and topical briefings from experts. Example sessions include ‘How to Work Effectively with Boards’ or building broader knowledge on topics such as levelling up or net zero. We also offer shadowing programmes with the aim of increasing cross-sector knowledge and experience.</p>

<h4>Spotlight on: Our Leaders</h4>

<p>“There’s a real world impact that comes from learning together across sectors. We are tackling common issues from different perspectives, and there’s a great opportunity to redesign systems to get better outcomes for local communities.”</p>

<p>Justin Johnston, Chief Fire Officer, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>Who it is for</h3>

<p>Our activities that bring Civil Service and wider public sector leaders together are open to the most senior leaders across the UK, with some events tailored to different levels of expertise. In practice this means leaders operating in the Civil Service at permanent secretary, director general and director level. In the public sector, this is chief executive officer and people reporting to them, the terminology for which varies by profession.</p>

<p>Public sector organisations range from healthcare and education to the emergency services and local government, alongside the Senior Civil Service. We are pleased to welcome colleagues across the whole Union to the Leadership College for Government, and work closely with our colleagues in the devolved administrations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>What leaders gain</h3>

<p>We know that a great part of successful public leadership comes from connected, systems leadership, working with colleagues across the system and focusing on the whole experience of citizens. We bring our leaders together in groups of different sizes to concentrate on specific skills and knowledge, while placing emphasis on building relationships between each other. It is these enduring relationships that last years and come to the fore in times of pressure and crisis.</p>

<p>These relationships may be developed, for example, through our monthly programme of connections, building leaders’ contacts across the Union, developing their knowledge of other professions and strengthening their personal support network. Through our peer shadowing programmes, leaders further their understanding of different operating environments and develop their own ability to move between sectors, a highly prized leadership quality.</p>
