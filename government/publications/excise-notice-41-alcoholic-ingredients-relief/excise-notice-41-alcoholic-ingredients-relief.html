<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This notice cancels and replaces Notice 41 (October 2017). Details of any changes to the previous version can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para12">paragraph 1.2</a> of this notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Summary</h3>

<p>This notice gives information about <abbr title="Alcoholic Ingredients Relief">AIR</abbr>. This relief provides for the repayment of excise duty charged on spirits, beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry when used in the production or manufacture of eligible articles as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para21">paragraph 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>It also gives general information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>production of eligible articles in warehouse</li>
  <li>records to be kept</li>
  <li>submission of relief claims</li>
  <li>other procedures and requirements</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Changes from the previous version</h3>

<p>This notice has been updated to tell you about the changes which have resulted from the UK leaving the European Union.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>As a claimant of the relief we expect that youâll be a revenue trader, that is, involved in any way with goods or services liable to excise duty, whether or not the duty has been paid. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Notice 206 Excise goods: Revenue tradersâ records</a> explains in more detail.</p>

<p>As a claimant of the relief you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if youâre a producer or manufacturer, exercise control over the production or manufacture of eligible articles</li>
  <li>keep complete and accurate accounts and records of the purchase and use of alcohol</li>
  <li>permit our officer to enter and inspect your premises and the production or manufacturing processes of any product in which alcohol is used</li>
  <li>upon request supply our officer with information and documents relating to the products supplied</li>
  <li>submit claims covering a 3 month period in which the eligible article was created within 3 years of the ending of that 3 month period (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para54">paragraph 5.4</a>)</li>
  <li>comply with the requirements of this notice</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fail to comply with the law, penalties may be imposed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> The applicable law</h3>

<p>The main laws governing the use of spirits, beer, wine, made-wine, cider and perry in the production or manufacture of eligible articles are in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/2" rel="external">Customs and Excise Management Act 1979</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1979/4/contents" rel="external">Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/4/contents" rel="external">Finance Act 1995</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/593/contents/made" rel="external">Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010</a> (SI 1992/3135)</li>
  <li>the Revenue Traders (Accounts and Records) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/3150)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing in this notice overrides the requirements of the law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Eligibility</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Eligible articles</h3>

<p>In this notice we use the term âeligible articlesâ, this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>beverages with an alcoholic strength not exceeding 1.2% alcohol by volume (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr>)</li>
  <li>chocolates for human consumption containing no more than 8.5 litres of alcohol per 100 <abbr title="Kilogram">kg</abbr> of chocolate</li>
  <li>other foods for human consumption (excluding beverages) containing no more than 5 litres of alcohol per 100 <abbr title="Kilogram">kg</abbr> of the final product</li>
  <li>vinegar</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Determining if products are eligible articles</h3>

<p>Where your final product is a liquid (other than vinegar), for example, a soft drink, the alcoholic strength of the liquid must not exceed 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where your final product is a solid or semi-solid article such as a frozen meal, the proportion of alcohol contained in the product must be compared against the net weight of the product, which is the weight excluding any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>packaging</li>
  <li>inedible accessories supplied (fork, spoon, dish, and so on, but not inedible parts of the article itself, for example, the bones in a chicken)</li>
  <li>products not normally associated with the eligible article for example, free gift</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.2.1 Products that consist of separate parts</h4>

<p>If the product consists of separate parts, not all of which contain alcoholic ingredients, (for example, a convenience food item consisting of a wine-based sauce with a separately packaged portion of rice), these may be taken together when assessing eligibility, provided you supply them as one product.</p>

<h4>2.2.2 Products produced by cooking</h4>

<p>Where a product is produced by cooking, the alcoholic ingredients will normally boil off during the cooking process leaving little or no alcohol in the final product. However, there will be occasions where the proportion of alcohol in the recipe exceeds the eligibility criteria and thereâs doubt as to whether the cooking process has reduced the level of alcohol to within the limit. In those cases itâs your responsibility to have the product analysed in support of your claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Eligibility to claim the relief</h3>

<p>You may claim relief from duty if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>produce or manufacture eligible articles using duty paid alcohol, or provide alcohol which is subsequently used to produce eligible articles</li>
  <li>comply with the requirements set out in this notice</li>
</ul>

<p>As an alternative to claiming relief from duty, you may be eligible to produce or manufacture your products using duty unpaid alcohol. For information on this facility â read <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec6">section 6</a>).</p>

<p>Youâre not eligible to claim the relief if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you produce syrups exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr> for use in vending or other point of sale dispensing machines of low alcohol or soft drinks</li>
  <li>youâre unable to comply with the requirements set out in this notice</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Conditions for treatment as an eligible article</h3>

<p>To be treated as an eligible article, any products for which a claim for alcoholic ingredients relief is made must be produced or manufactured under carefully controlled conditions and be regularly monitored to ensure they comply with the definition (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para21">paragraph 2.1</a>).</p>

<p>Conditions to support treatment as an eligible article include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>detailed records must be kept of all production and manufacturing processes including the quantities and strengths of alcohol used and measurements of the alcohol percentage in the final product â if products are produced under controlled conditions where alcohol is added by a calibrated machine, a representative sample must be checked for compliance with the conditions and results recorded</li>
  <li>if the process is not automated then proof of compliance with the definition will be needed for every eligible article or batch of eligible articles produced â this will include measurement of alcohol in the final product</li>
  <li>you must be able to prove that the alcohol for which the claim is made is the same alcohol that has been included in the eligible article â this will include evidence that sufficient security and other checks are in place to make sure alcohol for which a claim has been made cannot have been diverted for other use</li>
</ul>

<p>If these conditions (or other reasonable conditions that we need to ensure compliance with the objectives of the scheme) cannot be demonstrated to our satisfaction, then a repayment of duty on the alcohol incorporated in the eligible article will not be made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Claims from non-manufacturers</h3>

<p>The person or company producing or manufacturing the eligible article would normally make the claim. However there are circumstances where others in the alcohol supply chain may make a claim. If you can prove that youâve provided alcohol used to produce or manufacture an eligible article and can comply with all the relevant conditions within this notice then you may be able to make a claim (subject to the terms of <a class="govuk-link" href="#sec4">section 4</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Claiming on behalf of another person or company</h3>

<p>Relief may only be claimed by the person or company:</p>

<ul>
  <li>producing or manufacturing the eligible article</li>
  <li>paying duty on alcohol thatâs eventually incorporated into an eligible article</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Proof of duty payment</h2>

<p>To successfully make a claim you must be able to prove to our satisfaction that UK excise duty has been paid on the alcohol that has been incorporated into an eligible article.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Evidence of UK excise duty payment</h3>

<p>As the duty payer, you must submit either the original duty payment document or a copy of it.</p>

<p>Examples of what we mean as âduty payment documentâ could be any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your purchase invoice or invoices for the alcohol used in the eligible articles on your claim</li>
  <li>forms:
    <ul>
      <li>a validated copy 2 or electronic confirmation of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-remittance-advice-for-alcohol-goods-w5">W5</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-remittance-advice-for-tobacco-goods-w6">W6</a>, W50, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-warehousing-deferment-advice-for-alcohol-goods-w5d">W5D</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tobacco-products-duty-excise-warehouse-deferment-advice-for-tobacco-goods-w6d">W6D</a>
</li>
      <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-excise-duty-return-for-registered-consignees-or-registered-commercial-importers-hm2">HM2</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a>, TRC2</li>
      <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-beer-duty-return-ex46">EX46</a>, EX606</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a print out of the customs import declaration</li>
  <li>a duty deferment statement</li>
</ul>

<p>Other evidence may be accepted subject to our approval. Where youâve submitted evidence that is not one of the above, explain this clearly in writing along with your claim.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Proof that no other claims have been made for alcohol made into an eligible article</h2>

<p>We must make sure that claims are not duplicated. In certain circumstances we may need proof that no other claims have been made against the alcohol used in the eligible article.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Producer or manufacturer of an eligible article</h3>

<p>Unless we specifically need you to do so, youâll not have to demonstrate that claims have not been made by anyone else in the alcohol supply chain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Non-producers or non-manufacturers of an eligible article</h3>

<p>Although youâve not produced or manufactured the eligible article you may be able to make a claim for duty which has been paid on alcohol thatâs subsequently incorporated into an eligible article. The producer or manufacturer will normally make the claim, with any payment of duty to you being a commercial decision between you and the producer or manufacturer.</p>

<p>However, if you want to make a claim in your own right then you must be able to identify every person who has owned or held the alcohol used in the creation of an eligible article. You must be able to provide satisfactory evidence that no other person in the supply chain has previously made a claim for that alcohol under this scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Other conditions for non-producers or non-manufacturers</h3>

<p>In addition to the conditions at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para31">paragraphs 3.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para42">4.2</a> above you must be able to demonstrate that the conditions for compliance with the definition of an eligible article at <a class="govuk-link" href="#para21">paragraph 2.1</a> have been satisfied.</p>

<p>To satisfy this condition you must get evidence from the producer or manufacturer of the eligible article. This must have sufficient information to assure us that the article conforms to the definition. This will need to include recipes, measurements of alcoholic strength, production processes, and so on. This list is not exhaustive but the same level of evidence that a producer or manufacturer of the eligible article needs to produce must be given by the applicant. If the information is not deemed to be sufficient then weâll ask for more evidence to be given before considering a repayment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Making a claim</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Authorisation or licensing requirements</h3>

<p>Thereâs no requirement to apply for authorisation or give notice of your intention to claim duty. Also, if you use spirits purely for the manufacture of eligible articles you do not require a compounderâs licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Claiming relief for all alcohol used in the manufacturing process if only part of that alcohol remains in the eligible article</h3>

<p>Although eligibility is based on the proportion of alcohol remaining in the finished article, you can reclaim the duty on the total amount of alcohol you use in manufacturing the eligible article.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Claiming relief on imported alcohol</h3>

<p>Provided the UK duty has been paid and the alcohol is used as an ingredient in an eligible article you can claim relief on imported alcohol.</p>

<p>Where the Commissioners are satisfied that a product has been correctly exempted from excise duty in an EU member state, that product may enter the UK without the need for payment of excise duty. In these circumstances, the goods must travel with all necessary documentation to prove that the exemption has been granted, including where appropriate, official stamps or signatures and an explanation for the exemption from the relevant authorities. This applies only to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>If it cannot be established nor proven that an exemption has been correctly granted, the goods will be liable to excise duty in the normal way, but a subsequent claim for a refund of duty may be made if it conforms to the conditions set out in this notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Making a claim</h3>

<p>Claims are to be made on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-claim-for-alcoholic-ingredients-relief-ex597">Alcohol duties: claim for Alcoholic Ingredients Relief (EX597)</a> or contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries">Imports and exports: general enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>Separate claims are needed for each set of premises at which you produce or manufacture eligible articles.</p>

<p>Send your claims to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs  
<br>Excise Processing Team  
<br>BX9 1GL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Claims must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cover a production or manufacture period of 3 months</li>
  <li>be submitted within 3 years of the end of the 3 month production period in which the alcohol was incorporated into an eligible article</li>
  <li>include all alcohol used in the production of eligible articles during that period</li>
  <li>if made by a company, be signed by the proprietor, partner, or the company secretary or director of the company</li>
</ul>

<p>In special cases weâll allow you to authorise an employee at supervisory level or above to sign on your behalf. You must keep <abbr title="National Excise AIR Centre">NEAC</abbr> informed of any changes to the authorised signatory of the form</p>

<p>If you submit a claim later than the limit set out above, it should be accompanied by supporting evidence, such as a declaration from a company representative, explaining why the claim was not submitted on time. Each case will be considered on its own merit.</p>

<p>If you want, for exceptional reasons, to make a claim for a period of less than 3 months you should provide the <abbr title="National Excise AIR Centre">NEAC</abbr> with supporting evidence as to why you think this should be allowed.</p>

<p>If you do not comply with these conditions the <abbr title="National Excise AIR Centre">NEAC</abbr> is not obliged to authorise the repayment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Additional information needed</h3>

<p>When submitting a claim for <abbr title="Alcoholic Ingredients Relief">AIR</abbr>, you must include a worksheet or spreadsheet to show how youâve calculated your claim amount.</p>

<p>Identify each product used by name in a way that can be matched to your other evidence (for example, by brand name).</p>

<p>An example of the type of sheet we would expect to see is produced below. Failure to submit a worksheet will result in your claim being returned to you.</p>

<p>(* make sure the duty rate used in your calculation is the one that was in place at the time the alcohol was purchased, as rates may have changed following a budget. For wine and cider, the <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr> figure is used to make sure the correct rate has been applied as duty rates are banded for these products.

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Losses of duty paid product</h3>

<p>If you can explain why the losses occurred, you can still include the relevant excise duty as part of your claim.</p>

<p>As soon as any loss has been detected, you should note in your records the circumstances and reasons for the loss occurring.</p>

<p>Any losses for which you cannot give a satisfactory explanation will be excluded from your claim.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.7 </span> Payment of claims</h3>

<p>We can process your claim once we receive your completed claim form with all the required supporting documentation and evidence. We aim to process and pay complete claims within 30 working days.</p>

<p>Youâll receive your payment by bank transfer (<abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing System">Bacs</abbr>). Exceptionally we could pay by payable order. Weâll always pay any amount greater than Â£50,000 by <abbr title="Bankers Automated Clearing System">Bacs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Manufacture of eligible articles using duty unpaid alcohol</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> General</h3>

<p>If youâre a producer or manufacturer of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eligible articles (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para21">paragraphs 2.1</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#para22">2.2</a>) and have an anticipated duty liability of Â£5,000 or more per annum</li>
  <li>semi-finished products, such as flavours and essences, for use in the production of eligible articles</li>
</ul>

<p>We may approve you to produce or manufacture eligible articles under duty suspension (that is, in a trade facility warehouse using duty unpaid alcohol).</p>

<p>This means that your approval will be strictly limited to the production of eligible products. Youâll not be able to carry out any other operation under duty suspension <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Notice 196 Excise goods: Authorisation of warehousekeepers, approval of premises and registration of owners</a> explains in detail how to apply and what criteria are required for warehouse approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1.1. </span> Spirits used to make semi-finished products</h3>

<p>If you intend to use spirits in your manufacturing process to make semi-finished products which will not be used at your premises to produce eligible articles, youâll need a compounderâs licence. To apply for a licence, complete and sign <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-application-for-an-excise-trade-licence-l5">Alcohol duties: application for an Excise Trade licence (L5)</a> for a licence to carry on an excise trade and forward it along with your application for a warehouse approval to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

HM Revenue and Customs  
<br>Excise Processing Team  
<br>BX9 1GL
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>Thereâs no charge for the licence, and it lasts indefinitely. However, we can cancel your licence if you fail to comply with any of our requirements or if you stop trading.</p>

<p>A licence is not needed if you use only beer, wine, made-wine, cider or perry in your manufacturing processes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Approval to use duty unpaid alcohol</h3>

<p>We may visit you to look at the way you intend to control the receipt and use of alcohol and check that your business records are adequate for our purposes.</p>

<p>Once we are satisfied, weâll send you an approval letter in duplicate, asking you to sign it and return one copy. The approval letter will set out the conditions that you must meet.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Conditions of using duty unpaid alcohol</h3>

<p>The conditions we set may vary according to individual circumstances. However, the following conditions are common to all approvals. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exercise effective management control over your accounting and production systems</li>
  <li>permit us to enter your premises at any reasonable time</li>
  <li>provide any facilities or help we need to carry out our checks</li>
  <li>retain all records for at least six years</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Further requirements</h3>

<p>If you deliver semi-finished products to a manufacturer or producer in an excise or trade facility warehouse your despatch note or other document accompanying the products should show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address as the despatching warehouse</li>
  <li>the name and address of the receiving warehouse</li>
  <li>the bulk quantity and either the alcoholic strength or the quantity of alcohol (in litres) contained in each type of product supplied</li>
</ul>

<p>The receiving manufacturer or producer should acknowledge receipt of the products by endorsing the despatch note or other document and returning a copy to you. If any product is missing or damaged the manufacturer or producer should record details on the despatch note, or other similar things. Both you and the manufacturer or producer must keep copies of this documentation as part of your records.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Providing financial security</h3>

<p>Youâre not required to provide security as a normal condition of approval. However, if we find that your compliance with our requirements is poor we may need you to provide a financial guarantee. Under these circumstances weâll tell you what you must do.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Spirit-based flavourings and essences</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Payment of duty on imports of spirit-based flavourings and essences</h3>

<p>Duty is not payable on any spirits contained in flavourings imported into the UK or used in the production of flavourings, if those flavourings are for use in the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>preparation of food for human consumption</li>
  <li>preparation of any beverage of an alcoholic strength not exceeding 1.2%</li>
</ul>

<p>and fall within <abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr> Code 3302. This provision also applies to essences.</p>

<p>Spirits based flavourings and essences not classified under Code 3302 will be liable to duty (but may be eligible for <abbr title="Alcoholic Ingredients Relief">AIR</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Spirit-based flavourings and essences manufactured for distribution within the UK</h3>

<p>Thereâs no duty liability for spirit-based flavourings and essences manufactured and distributed within the UK if they fall under the classification in <abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr> Code 3302 and comply with the conditions in <a class="govuk-link" href="#para71">paragraph 7.1</a>.</p>

<p>There is a duty liability for all other spirit based flavourings and essences, other than while those products are subject to duty suspense provisions. The liability of products containing flavourings and essences will be determined by the final product.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Warehouse approval to receive or supply spirit-based flavourings and essences duty unpaid</h3>

<p>Spirit-based flavourings and essences classified under <abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr> Code 3302 are exempt from duty if they comply with the conditions in paragraph 7.1 (even if they are spirit-based with a strength of over 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr>). There is no need for an excise or trade facility warehouse approval to receive or supply these products without paying the duty.</p>

<p>However, warehouse approval is needed if you want to receive or supply any spirits-based flavourings and essences in duty suspension that are not classified under <abbr title="Combined Nomenclature">CN</abbr> Code 3302.</p>

<p>The duty liability will be determined by the nature of the end product.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Duty on essences which are used to manufacture or produce alcoholic drinks</h3>

<p>If you manufacture or produce any alcoholic drink which has a strength exceeding 1.2% <abbr title="alcohol by volume">abv</abbr>, then that drink will be liable to duty. The duty liability will be determined by the nature of the end product.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Records and accounts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Records and accounts requirements</h3>

<p>As a revenue trader, we require you to keep records of all activities involving the use of alcohol in the production or manufacture of eligible articles. This includes information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quantity and type of alcohol received</li>
  <li>stockholdings</li>
  <li>use in production</li>
  <li>the quantity and type of eligible articles manufactured or produced</li>
  <li>sales of eligible articles</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Notice 206 Excise goods: Revenue tradersâ records</a> explains in detail what records you need to keep if youâre a revenue trader, that is a trader involved in any way with goods or services liable to excise duty.</p>

<p>Generally, your normal business records will contain or can be modified to contain the information we need. However, they must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accurate and kept up to date</li>
  <li>completed in ink or other permanently legible material</li>
  <li>readily accessible to us</li>
  <li>kept at your premises for at least 6 years from the date of the last entry (we are aware that this may cause you storage problems, involve you in undue expense or cause you other difficulties â if so, you can ask our helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700 for permission to keep some of your records for a shorter period)</li>
  <li>available for inspection at all reasonable times</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove any information from your records</li>
  <li>obliterate or delete any entry</li>
</ul>

<p>without the agreement of our helpline, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries">Imports and exports: general enquiries</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of each production period (read <a class="govuk-link" href="#para54">paragraph 5.4</a>) you must add up and record the total quantity of each type of alcohol (that is, spirits, wine, and so on) used during the period and the excise duty paid on it. Wine and made-wine must be totalled and recorded by duty banding.</p>

<p>Remember, if youâre claiming relief on products containing made-wine, which may have been diluted after the duty was paid, you must be able to identify the amount of duty paid on that product.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Other records</h3>

<p>As a revenue trader we require you to maintain and produce for examination your records of your business activities. This includes all records and documents relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>stock</li>
  <li>handling</li>
  <li>purchases</li>
  <li>sales</li>
  <li>imports</li>
  <li>exports</li>
  <li>any losses in production of dutiable products</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these records, we may examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>profit and loss and trading statements</li>
  <li>management accounts and reports</li>
  <li>balance sheets and trading forecasts</li>
  <li>internal and external auditors reports</li>
  <li>any record maintained for a business purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>As a claimant, we may also ask you to produce specific records or documents that relate to your particular claim, whether or not you consider yourself to be a revenue trader.</p>

<p>Weâre aware that a great deal of information to which we have access is of a confidential nature. We take great care to make sure that respect for confidentiality is maintained.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Visit to inspect records</h3>

<p>Weâll visit you from time to time to verify your claims. When we visit, we need you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>admit us to your premises</li>
  <li>produce your records and goods for inspection</li>
  <li>provide facilities for examining the goods and taking account of them</li>
  <li>allow us to take samples</li>
  <li>observe health and safety requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>For non-manufacturers weâll need admission to examine your accounting and other records that you must keep in support of your claim</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Avoiding penalties</h3>

<p>You can avoid a financial penalty by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>checking that youâve given complete and accurate information in your claim for relief</li>
  <li>applying for a licence to carry on an Excise Trade at the correct time</li>
</ul>

<p>You have the right to appeal if we impose a penalty.</p>

<p>If youâre unaware youâve made a mistake in your claim, or have not applied for a licence, tell us as soon as possible. Weâll be able to reduce the penalty in many cases to zero.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Review and appeal procedures</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Disagreements with decisions made</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against, weâll tell you and offer you a review. Weâll explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment the issue of a civil penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to the relevant duty or claim</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâll usually have three options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer youâve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> Time limits to ask for a review</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter. Weâll complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or weâve told you the outcome.</p>

<p>If youâre not satisfied with the reviewâs conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, weâll ask you if youâre willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>Weâll write and tell you this: you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Requesting a review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> Appeal to independent tribunal</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review, you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the Tribunals Service within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>
