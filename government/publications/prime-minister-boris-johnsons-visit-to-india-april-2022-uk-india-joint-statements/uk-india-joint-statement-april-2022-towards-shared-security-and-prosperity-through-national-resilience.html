This is his first visit to India as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and follows his Virtual Summit with Prime Minister Modi in May 2021 where both leaders agreed to elevate India-UK relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, underpinned by a shared commitment to democracy, fundamental freedoms, multilateralism and a rules-based international order. The visit is also taking place at a significant time as the two countries celebrate 75 years of bilateral ties and India is commemorating the 75th anniversary of her Independence.</p>

<p>3.	Both Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction at the progress in implementation of the ambitious Roadmap 2030 for India-UK future relations that was launched at the Virtual Summit, and appreciated its regular review by External Affairs Minister, Dr S Jaishankar and UK Foreign Secretary, Ms Elizabeth Truss.

They noted with satisfaction that good progress had been made already, and that the agreement of an FTA would unlock the full potential of the trade and commercial relationship, boosting jobs, investment and exports. They set a target to conclude the majority of talks on a comprehensive and balanced Free Trade Agreement by the end of October 2022.</p>

<p>6.	They acknowledged the increasing investment flows between the two nations, and welcomed the progress made in the 11th Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), recalling commitments to cooperate closely on COVID-19 recovery, climate finance, services trade and multilateral engagement.  They looked forward to further cooperation through the EFD, including intensifying cooperation in financial services, banking, insurance, fintech, green bonds, sustainable finance and capital market sectors and to promote collaboration between regulators and stakeholders. They specifically highlighted the successful India-UK collaborations between GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, India’s first International Financial Service Centre) and the UK’s financial services ecosystem and agreed to develop greater linkages between the two countries’ financial markets. They noted the successful resolution of recent taxation issues as a positive step to further strengthen investor confidence on both sides.</p>

<p>8.

<p>12.

<p>17.	Both leaders expressed zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms – and for all those who encourage, support and finance terrorism or provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups - whatever their motivation may be.
