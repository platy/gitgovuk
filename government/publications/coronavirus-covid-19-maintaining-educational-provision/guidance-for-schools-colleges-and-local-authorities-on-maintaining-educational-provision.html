<p>Early years and children care settings, schools and colleges continue to be open for all children and young people in England and attendance of school age children remains compulsory.</p>

<p>These settings may however need to change how they are delivering education and childcare for a short period of time in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings">Contingency Framework</a>.
