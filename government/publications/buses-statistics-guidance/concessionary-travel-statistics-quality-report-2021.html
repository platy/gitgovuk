<p><strong>About this release</strong></p>

<p>This document supports the latest Concessionary Travel Survey statistics. The statistics provide the most up to date statistics on the number of older and disabled concessionary passes, the number of concessionary bus journeys, and the payments made by Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs) to reimburse bus operators for concessionary fares.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) statistical release Concessionary Travel in England, financial year ending 2021 presents figures relating to free bus travel for older and disabled people. The release also includes information on concessions on other transport modes and concessions for other groups, including young people.</p>

<p>This document provides explanatory information relating to concessionary travel policy in England, the data collection and analysis methodologies and notes relating to the sources and robustness of specific data tables in the release.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> carries out the annual Concessionary Travel Survey (CT Survey) of Travel Concession Authorities (<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>) between June and August each year. The latest release is based on the surveys undertaken in 2021 with data relating to the financial year ending 2021, although some information, such as discretionary enhancements, relate to the current financial year ending 2022.</p>

<p>The latest data tables from the CT Survey are labelled <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus08-concessionary-travel">BUS08</a>.</p>

<h2>Background to the concessionary travel statistics</h2>

<p>A statutory bus concession for older and disabled people has been in place since 2001. This initially provided for a minimum half-fare concession for older and disabled people travelling on buses within their local authority of residence, extended to a full fare (for example, free) concession in 2006. In 2008, the concession was extended further to cover free local bus travel between 09:30am and 11:00pm to older and disabled people anywhere in England. This statutory concession is referred to as the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (<abbr title="English National Concessionary Travel Scheme">ENCTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>At local-level, concessionary travel schemes are administered by Travel Concession Authorities (<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>). <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> correspond to upper-tier local authorities - county councils, unitary authorities and the 6 metropolitan areas, Passenger Transport Executives (<abbr title="Passenger Transport Executives">PTEs</abbr>) or Integrated Transport Authorities (<abbr title="Integrated Transport Authorities">ITAs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Prior to 2011, <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> were lower-tier local authorities (such as district councils).<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> are required by law to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys made under the <abbr title="English National Concessionary Travel Scheme">ENCTS</abbr> which start within their boundaries, regardless of whether the concessionary passenger making the journey is resident in their area.</p>

<p>Some <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> offer additional discretionary concessions for their residents, over and above the <abbr title="English National Concessionary Travel Scheme">ENCTS</abbr>. These may include free or reduced travel outside the statutory time period or on other transport modes. Concessions for other groups, including young or unemployed people are non-statutory but are also offered in some areas.</p>

<p>In London, the statutory concession for older and disabled London residents also covers off-peak travel on the whole London Local Transport Network, including tram and underground travel. The scheme is administered by London Councils, on behalf of the 32 London Boroughs and the City of London.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> publishes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/concessionary-bus-travel-guidance-for-local-authorities">guidance</a> to assist with negotiating and calculating reimbursement.</p>

<h2>Pass eligibility</h2>

<p>From 2002 to 2010, all those aged 60 years and over were eligible for a concessionary travel pass. Since April 2010, the eligibility age has been tied to the State Pension age for women.</p>

<p>For women, the age of concessionary pass eligibility is their pensionable age, for men, the age of eligibility is the pensionable age of a woman born on the same day. The pensionable age for women has risen, and from 2020 was 66 for both men and women. The eligibility age for concessionary travel is rising in line with these changes.</p>

<p>Disabled people of any age are eligible for a pass if they meet the eligibility criteria. These criteria are described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-local-authorities-on-eligibility-for-disabled-people"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs guidance</a> to <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> may also offer discretionary passes to those who do not meet the statutory age or disability requirement, such as young or unemployed people. Some also offer additional concessions to statutory pass holders, such as extended travel times or other modes.</p>

<h2>Concessionary Travel Survey</h2>

<p>The Concessionary Travel Survey (CT Survey) is an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">annual data</a> collection by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, to gather information from Travel Concession Authorities (<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>). The survey is sent to <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> outside London and to London Councils. 
The 2021 Survey ran from May to October 2021, collecting outturn data for the financial year ending 2021.</p>

<p>The survey asks questions relating to expenditure, pass numbers, concessionary journeys, reimbursement and discretionary concessions. <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> are asked to report outturn for the most recent financial year.</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>

<p>These figures are Official Statistics. Official Statistics are produced to the high professional standards set by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>. However, these statistics have not yet been assessed by the Office for Statistics Regulation. Data collection is online through a secure website. The validation process compares data to previous returns and following up with respondents to confirm or correct responses. This provides background on changing activities of <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>, catches entry errors and provides an opportunity for clarification where there is ambiguity over how a specific policy relates to the given question.</p>

<h2>Other dimensions of quality</h2>

<h3>Response rate</h3>

<p>Responses were received most <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> in 2021 for pass numbers, journeys, reimbursement and total net current expenditure, not all <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> were able to complete some of the more detailed questions, for example on the spilt between statutory and discretionary expenditure.</p>

<p>The survey in 2021 included voluntary questions to collect data for the financial year ending 2020 where this data was available. Four out of five <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> provided this data.</p>

<h3>Data analysis and imputation</h3>

<p>The figures presented in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus08-concessionary-travel">BUS0810 to BUS0830</a> are national-level totals, broken down by area type (metropolitan or non-metropolitan areas). They are derived by aggregating figures for individual <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where figures were missing, due to question or survey non-response, they were imputed. Where needed figures from an adjacent year have been used as a starting point for imputation and area-level (London, metropolitan or non-metropolitan) growth rates have been applied to get an estimate for the missing value.</p>

<p>Missing figures for net current expenditure were imputed using finance figures collected by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (<abbr title="Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government">MHCLG</abbr>) as part of the Revenue Outturn and Revenue Account Budget (RO2) data collections.</p>

<p>To apportion the total between statutory and discretionary expenditure, area-level assumptions based on the proportional split between statutory and discretionary spend were used, factoring in additional information of the discretions offered in the missing <abbr title="Travel Concession Authority">TCA</abbr> if applicable.</p>

<h3>Revisions to previous years</h3>

<p>Figures for previous years are sometimes revised. These are marked as <strong>ârâ</strong> in the published tables. Revisions take place for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improvements to the methodology for imputing missing data</li>
  <li>errors identified in previous survey responses that were corrected by local authorities</li>
  <li>improving earlier imputations with directly reported data for later years</li>
</ul>

<p>Revisions to data for previous years have typically resulted in minor changes to national totals.</p>

<h3>Respondent burden</h3>

<p>During follow up contact around the 2021 survey respondents were asked to comment on the respondent burden of completing the survey. The burden of completing the survey varies between respondents. Of those who provided a comment most needed less than a day of work to complete. The largest burden reported was approximately 28 hours, including time spent obtaining data from operators. The main factor contributing to heavier respondent burden was where respondents needed to obtain data from other departments or bus operators.</p>

<h3>Timeliness</h3>

<p>The reporting period is 31 March 2021 and the survey was published on 3 November 2021. The Survey was not carried out in 2020 to ease the burden on <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Accuracy</h3>

<p>Returns are supplied by <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> and validated against previous data. Where figures are missing these are imputed based on previous returns and the data for similar <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr></p>

<h2>Strengths of the data</h2>

<h3>Consistency over time</h3>

<p>The core questions in the survey, such as on expenditure and journeys, are consistently providing a long times series for key measures. Some questions, such as on further concessions offered have changed over time to better provide for the needs of users.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The survey covers all Transport Concession Authorities (<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>) in England.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>The practical detail of the provision of concessions can lead to difficulty in assigning different activities to categories, such as additional concessions to those already eligible to <abbr title="English National Concessionary Travel Scheme">ENCTS</abbr>. Respondents are provided with documentation to support the questionnaire. They are also encouraged to provide additional detail through free text responses, this helps with validation by providing explanations for changes or unusual results and can also clarify the exact nation of the <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> activity and how it relates to the question.</p>

<h2>Eligibility age</h2>

<p><abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> were asked to report the number of older and disabled concessionary passes in the authority. For most <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>, passes are only available for older and disabled people meeting the statutory eligibility criteria, but a small number offer discretionary passes to other older and disabled people and these discretionary passes have been included in the totals reported here.</p>

<p>To calculate the âpasses per hundred eligible older peopleâ measures, we use the latest older population as reported by the Office for National Statistics, based on mid-year population estimates for the relevant years.
When the eligibility age is changing, it is not possible to get an exact match to the eligible population.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The eligibility age was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>60 years old at the start of the financial year ending 2011</li>
  <li>60.5 years old at the financial year ending 2011</li>
  <li>61 years old at the financial year ending 2012</li>
  <li>61.5 years old at the financial year ending 2013</li>
  <li>62 years old at the financial year ending 2014</li>
  <li>62.5 years old at the financial year ending 2015</li>
  <li>63.0 years old at the financial year ending 2016</li>
  <li>63.5 years old at the financial year ending 2017</li>
  <li>64.0 years old at the financial year ending 2018</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>As the pass numbers supplied by the <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> were an average across the whole financial year, the âeligible older populationâ is approximated to be the mid-point age in each of those years, for example, 63.75 years old at mid-2015 (for the financial year ending 2018).</p>

<h2>Other concessionary travel data sources</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</a> collects some information about concessionary travel, including pass take-up rates by area and gender as well as more general information on personal travel patterns amongst older people.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts06-age-gender-and-modal-breakdown"><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> tables</a> relating specifically to concessionary travel are available.</p>

<p>A time-series back to the year ending March 2008 of all concessionary bus journeys, including youth concessionary journeys, can be accessed from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys">Tables BUS01</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> collects and publishes a range of other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bus-statistics">statistics</a> relating to bus travel, including passenger journeys and operator finance.</p>

<p>Data on concessionary journeys on light rail and tram systems is collected as part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/series/light-rail-and-tram-statistics"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs light rail and tram survey</a>, including concessionary journeys and reimbursement revenue by light rail system.</p>

<h2>Comparison with other data sources</h2>

<h3>Pass take-up rates from the National Travel Survey</h3>

<p>The National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>) is the primary source of data on personal travel patterns, based on a sample of households in England. As part of the survey, individuals are asked whether they hold a concessionary travel pass.</p>

<p>Based on the 2018 <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> (the latest data available), the pass take-up rate amongst older people in England was 73% of the eligible population.</p>

<p>In the CT Survey, <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> reported that there were 8.2 million older passes in England in the year ending 2019, corresponding to an apparent âtake-up rateâ of 77%, which is broadly similar to the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> estimate, when taking into account the imputation of some CT Survey estimates, sampling error around <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> estimates and the imprecision of the population estimates in the calculation of CT Survey take-up rates.</p>

<p>Given these caveats, the older pass data from the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> and CT Survey are in reasonable agreement. A similar comparison for disabled passes is not possible, as only a very small number of these are recorded within the <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> sample.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=%22annual+bus+statistics%2C+year+ending%22&amp;order=relevance&amp;organisations%5B%5D=department-for-transport"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs annual survey of Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>)</a> operators collects data on the number of concessionary bus journeys from a sample of operators and scales up to give national-level totals.</p>

<p>The latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys">statistics</a> for all concessionary journeys â statutory and discretionary older and disabled and youth journeys.</p>

<p>At the national level, the journeys totals are consistent. The discrepancies for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas are also small. The difference for London is larger. There can be differences in the trends in these two series. There may be differences in how journeys are recorded by <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> operators and local authorities, coverage of the surveys and by necessity, differences in the way that missing data are imputed.</p>

<h2>Uses of the statistics</h2>

<p>Within the Department for Transport, these statistics are used to understand the impact of changes to the concessionary travel scheme and reimbursement guidance, for ministerial briefing and to answer public enquiries. Outside the department, users include <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> and others with an interest in concessionary travel, such as campaign groups, bus operators and specialist transport press.</p>

<p>We welcome any feedback on these statistics, to ensure future releases best meet user needs. Feedback can be provided by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:bus.statistics@dft.gov.uk">bus statistics</a>.</p>
