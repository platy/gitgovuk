<p><strong>About this release</strong></p>

<p>This document supports the latest annual bus statistics. It is part of the Bus Statistics series. Detailed data tables are available from the website. The statistics cover Great Britain.</p>

<p>For detailed commentary please see the annual statistical release. The statistics cover in the annual publication cover England only.</p>

<h2>About annual bus statistics</h2>

<p>The annual bus statistics release is based on a number of sources but primarily compiled from the annual Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) survey of over 500 local bus operators. The survey provides information on passenger journeys, vehicle miles, revenue and costs, and vehicles and staff. Information on passenger journeys and bus mileage for London is provided by Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>).</p>

<p>Certain statistics are based on separate smaller surveys of the larger operators, such as information on fares, or from local authorities (punctuality, concessionary travel). In addition to the annual publication, estimates of patronage and fare changes are available on a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bus-statistics">quarterly basis</a>.</p>

<p>A copy of the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey form is available at the end of this report.</p>

<h2>Quality of the annual bus data</h2>

<p>Annual bus statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> and were confirmed as National Statistics in February 2013.</p>

<p>This report outlines some of the quality aspects of the data.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Annual panel survey of passenger numbers</h3>

<p>The annual bus statistics publication represents the most comprehensive single source of official data on the bus industry in Great Britain and provides data which is used in monitoring trends, developing policy and providing accountability for the subsidy provided to the industry, at a high level.</p>

<p>Many of the figures have been collected and compiled in a broadly similar way since the deregulation of the bus industry and therefore allow trends over time to be measured.</p>

<p>The primary source is the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey, an annual survey run by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) to collect information on the bus and coach industries and is a legal requirement under the Statistics of Trade Act (1947). It is a source for data on passenger journeys (tables BUS01xx), vehicle miles (tables BUS02xx), passenger miles (tables BUS03xx), operating revenue and costs (tables BUS04xx and BUS05xx), vehicles (tables 06xx) and staff (table BUS07xx).</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

<p>These statistics provide key information on trends in the bus sector. Within the Department for Transport they are used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ministerial briefing and to answer public enquiries</li>
  <li>as background to policy development</li>
  <li>monitoring trends in the bus sector, for example in relation to accessible buses</li>
  <li>by economists in modelling policy options</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> known uses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>passenger journeys figures are used as a measure of the overall health or state of the industry, for example by private research organisations, and are occasionally reported in the trade press</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local authorities may use these statistics to compare trends in their area with the national picture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these statistics have also provided background information for recent reports by the Transport Select Committee and Competition Commission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bus fares data are used by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) in calculating the Retail and Consumer Price Indices and in the National Accounts</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Coverage</h2>

<p>These statistics refer to the activities of holders of Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) operators’ licences. An operator wishing to run bus or coach services is normally required to possess a <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> licence. However, certain vehicles and types of service are exempt from licensing and are excluded from the figures, such as community buses and local services operated by taxis. The tables relate to local bus services.</p>

<p>A local bus service is a stopping service available to the general public, where the route is registered with the Traffic Commissioner, which is eligible for Bus Service Operators Grant.</p>

<p>Data is collected from over 450 local bus operators out of approximately 600 and Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>) who provide data on passenger journeys, vehicle miles, revenue and costs, and vehicles and staff. The annual survey data provided by operators covers around, or above, 95% of the total figure for key indicators (passenger journeys and vehicle miles operated), with the remainder imputed.</p>

<p>Because the local bus sector is dominated by relatively few large operators, most of whom provide data, sampling errors (that is random fluctuations due to selecting only a sample of operators) are very small in relation to other non-sampling errors (for example, inaccurate data provided by operators). The annual publication is for England, but some tables cover Great Britain.</p>

<h2>Strengths of the data</h2>

<p><strong>Long-term and continuous</strong></p>

<p>Many of the figures have been collected and compiled in a broadly similar way since the deregulation of the bus industry and therefore allow trends over time to be measured. Although, following revisions to the methodology used to compile the published figures, year ending March 2005 is the earliest year for which figures are comparable on exactly the same basis.</p>

<p><strong>Coverage</strong></p>

<p>Because the local bus sector is dominated by relatively few large operators, most of whom provide data, sampling errors (that is random fluctuations due to selecting only a sample of operators) are very small in relation to other non-sampling errors (for example, inaccurate data provided by operators). Comparison with other sources suggests that, at the aggregate (national) level, the statistics are likely to provide a robust measure of both levels and trends.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p><strong>Coverage</strong></p>

<p>While overall coverage is good, coverage for the very small operators is less good. This is due to a variety of factors including lack of contact info and inability to complete the survey due to respondent burden. Typically, these operators only hold one or two discs and make up a tiny fraction of passenger journeys in total.</p>

<p><strong>Journeys not passengers</strong></p>

<p>The survey captures the number of passenger boardings or journeys. This is not the same as the number of passengers as one passenger may make multiple trips.</p>

<p><strong>Journey details</strong></p>

<p>While the survey captures the number of passenger boardings, it does not capture detailed information about the journeys, such as the origin and destination, or purpose of the journey.</p>

<p><strong>Passenger details</strong></p>

<p>The survey does not capture any details of the people using local bus services, such as their demographics, journey satisfaction, or the reasons behind their travel mode choice. However, data from other sources are used to provide supplement data (see below).</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>

<p>As National Statistics, the annual statistics are produced to high professional standards as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/" rel="external">Code of Practice for statistics</a> and many quality control measures are in place to ensure the integrity of the data.</p>

<p>Data collection is online through a secure website. A copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-statistics-notes-and-guidance-buses">survey questions</a> is available.</p>

<p>The key sources of errors arising in the production of statistics derived from the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey are likely to be the result of inaccurate returns provided by bus operators. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> attempts to mitigate the impact of such errors through data validation and cleaning, in particular comparing data provided by the larger operators with previous years, though this is not always possible. Some aspects of the survey are particularly difficult for some operators, usually the smaller ones, to complete.</p>

<p>These validation checks are used to generate a quality assurance report to ensure that any large changes compared with previous years are identified and investigated, seeking explanations where differences are large or unexpected.</p>

<h2>Other dimensions of quality</h2>

<p><strong>Response rate</strong></p>

<p>Although all operators are encouraged and reminded to return the survey, greater effort is made to receive data from larger local operators to ensure that the resulting estimates are as robust as possible.</p>

<p>In the financial year ending 2021, full or partial responses were received from 478 operators (86% of the sample), approximately 90% of returns were complete giving a full response rate of 75%.</p>

<p>We got a 100% response rate from all companies with over 5 million journeys in the year ending March 2020 and a 92% response rate for those with between 1 million and 5 million journeys in the year ending March 2020. Overall, this means 98% of journeys nationally were from the survey and just 2% was imputed.</p>

<p><strong>Respondent burden</strong></p>

<p>There are 84 questions on a variety of different areas. This means respondent burden can vary depending on company size and can involve multiple different teams within a company. No formal assessment has been made, but Including queries on returns provided, it is likely to be on average a day of one person’s time to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness</strong></p>

<p>The statistical release is generally published around 6 to 7 months after the end of the reference period.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>Comparison with other sources suggests that, at the aggregate (national) level, the statistics are likely to provide a reasonably robust measure of levels and broad trends. However, figures representing smaller groups of operators and single year on year changes should be treated with caution as these are more susceptible to measurement errors (for example, an inaccurate return by an operator, or a change in an operator’s method of producing the figures such as the introduction of ticketing machines to record data) which are more likely to even out at the national level.</p>

<p>Because the local bus sector is dominated by relatively few large operators, most of whom provide data, sampling errors (that is random fluctuations due to selecting only a sample of operators) are very small in relation to other non-sampling errors (for example, inaccurate data provided by operators). There remains the possibility that the data captured is incorrect: respondents may make an error when completing the return or there may be errors in the underlying data. Our quality assurance procedures attempt to mitigate these errors, although they cannot entirely remove this risk.</p>

<p>The majority of figures are based largely on data provided directly by operators, aggregated to national and sub-national levels. Where such figures are not available (either because an operator was not included in a survey, or was selected but did not provide a return or missed some questions) figures for that operator are imputed using previous year’s figures where possible, applying other data if available or based on the number of licence discs held.</p>

<p>For the key indicators (passenger journeys and vehicle miles operated) the data provided by operators covers around, or above, 95% of the total figure, with the remainder imputed. This will also have an impact with previous years’ data, where more up to date information is used to impute data, usually limited to the two preceding years and changes of under 1% to previously reported figures. In rare occurrences, we receive corrections to previous year data which may change figures to a more significant level particularly at local authority level, including reallocations across local authority boundaries.</p>

<p>Imputations are made using past year data for that company or where none exists using a coefficient factor for companies of a similar size and area type.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey uses imputation techniques to derive key figures for operators who were either not selected in the sample for that year, or who did not respond. On occasion, imputations for earlier years can be improved using directly reported data for later years. Minor revisions to back-data can occur as a result, although trends are rarely affected substantively.</p>

<h2>Factors affecting financial year ending 2021 figures</h2>

<p>The survey this year has been affected by the impact of coronavirus on bus operators with staff working from home or furloughed and the collection date (multiple questions asked “as at 31st March 2021”). Several operators interpreted some of the questions not as intended and others had limited staff available to respond to the survey, we believe we addressed most of the issues during our validation of the survey and updated responses from operators.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> bus punctuality statistics</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The punctuality survey is an annual survey of all local authorities in England which provides a measure of the performance of local bus services. The figures are based either on manual surveys carried out by local authorities, or from electronic data derived from Automatic Vehicle Location (<abbr title="Automatic Vehicle Location">AVL</abbr>) devices.</p>

<p>The survey provides estimates of the percentage of non-frequent bus services running on time and the average excess waiting time for frequent services. These estimates are published at local authority level in tables <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus09-frequency-and-waiting-times">BUS0902 and BUS0903</a> respectively. The survey also contains voluntary questions on passenger boardings and local bus vehicle miles.</p>

<h2>Strengths of the data</h2>

<p><strong>Long term and continuous</strong></p>

<p>The first punctuality survey was carried out in the year ending March 2005 and has been run annually since then, with the exception of the year ending March 2020 when the survey was not run to reduce the burden on local authorities during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Coverage</strong></p>

<p>All local authorities in England are included in the punctuality survey.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p><strong>Comparability</strong></p>

<p>As the figures are provided by different authorities, there are some differences in the methods used to calculate punctuality which may affect comparisons between different authorities. In particular, the source of the data varies with some authorities utilising electronic data from <abbr title="Automatic Vehicle Location">AVL</abbr> devices whilst others will use a sample of manual surveys.</p>

<p><strong>Response rate</strong></p>

<p>While the survey is issued to all local authorities in England, we do not receive responses from all of these authorities. This is due to a variety of factors including local authorities not holding this data or not having access to it from operators or local authorities being unable to run manual surveys.</p>

<h2>Data quality</h2>

<p>As Official Statistics, the annual statistics are produced to high professional standards as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> and many quality control measures are in place to ensure the integrity of the data.</p>

<p>Data collection is online through a secure website. A copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bus-statistics-data-collection-forms">survey questions</a> is available.</p>

<p>Validation checks are used to ensure that any large changes compared with previous years are investigated. Returns are validated by comparison with previous years and seeking explanation where differences are large or unexpected.</p>

<h2>Other dimensions of quality</h2>

<p><strong>Response rate</strong></p>

<p>The survey response rate is high, in the latest survey, 81% of local authorities responded to the survey.</p>

<p><strong>Respondent burden</strong></p>

<p><strong>In terms of time:</strong></p>

<p>For data obtained electronically through automatic vehicle location (<abbr title="Automatic Vehicle Location">AVL</abbr>), the time taken to complete the survey varied between 30 minutes to 4,200 minutes. We estimate the median time taken to complete the survey was 180 minutes.</p>

<p>For data obtained through a manual survey, the time taken to complete the survey varied between 45 minutes to 2,700 minutes. We estimate the median time taken to complete the survey was 930 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>In terms of costs:</strong></p>

<p>Some local authorities incurred external costs to complete the survey. External costs incurred varied between £2,000 and £21,000.</p>

<p>For data collected through <abbr title="Automatic Vehicle Location">AVL</abbr>, it varied between £2,500 and £21,000. We estimate the median external costs incurred was £11,750.</p>

<p>For data collected through a manual survey, it varied between £2,000 and £10,000. We estimate the median external costs incurred was £6,000.</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness</strong></p>

<p>The statistical release is generally published around 6 to 7 months after the end of the reference period.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>The individual figures reported by authorities are calculated using their internal systems and so are based on the information held by the individual authority. There are a number of factors that may affect the accuracy of the data. These include variations in the methodology applied by different authorities including the data source (manual survey versus <abbr title="Automatic Vehicle Location">AVL</abbr>) and the methodology used to calculate punctuality measures.</p>

<p>There also remains the possibility that there are errors in the sampling and calculation of the punctuality measures, the data captured is incorrect, the form may not be clear, or the respondents may make an error when completing the form. While our quality assurance procedures attempt to mitigate these errors, it does not remove the risk of them entirely.</p>

<h2>Other data sources</h2>

<p>The annual bus statistics publication uses data from a number of different sources and there are further sources of useful information on buses and bus travel which provide alternative, additional or contextual data to provide a more complete picture of the bus sector these include:</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and other sources used in the publication</h2>

<p><strong><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> Quarterly fares survey</strong></p>

<p>Covers changes in fares on local bus services in Great Britain, split by region. Data for the bus fares index is collected through a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">sample survey</a> of around 100 operators and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>. The index measures change in the gross yield. This is the change in passenger receipts (excluding concessionary fare reimbursement and subsidies from the government) which would result from a fares change, assuming no change in passenger numbers.</p>

<p>Operators supply information each quarter. Annual indices for groups of operators in different areas of Great Britain are obtained by averaging.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> Quarterly bus panel survey</strong></p>

<p>Is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">quarterly survey</a> of the 18 largest non-metropolitan bus operators, Passenger Transport Executives (for the metropolitan areas) and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>. It covers over 90% of the journeys made in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The survey provides quarterly estimates of passenger journeys figures (given in table BUS0106) and the first provisional estimate of the annual figure. The quarterly estimates are constrained to the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey annual total figures, as the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey covers a greater number of journeys and operators.</p>

<p><strong>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> bus punctuality statistics</strong></p>

<p>Tables BUS0902 and BUS0903 are based on an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">annual survey</a> of local authorities who monitor punctuality using manual surveys or data from electronic systems. They provide one measure of the performance of local bus services. There are different measures of punctuality for frequent and non-frequent services.</p>

<p>The year ending March 2020 survey has been cancelled due to the impact of COVID-19 on local authority resources.</p>

<p><strong>Concessionary Travel Survey (CT Survey)</strong></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">Annual data</a> collection by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, to gather information from Travel Concession Authorities (<abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>). A statutory bus concession for older and disabled people has been in place since 2001. This statutory concession is referred to as the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (<abbr title="English National Concessionary Travel Scheme">ENCTS</abbr>) and is administered by the <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The survey is sent to the 89 <abbr title="Travel Concession Authorities">TCAs</abbr> outside London and to London Councils. The survey asks questions relating to expenditure, pass numbers, concessionary journeys, reimbursement and availability of youth and other discretionary concessions. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/concessionary-travel-statistics-year-ending-march-2021">latest figures and further information</a> are available.</p>

<p><strong>Transport for London data</strong></p>

<p>Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>) covers half of all local bus passenger journeys in England and are responsible for bus registrations in London. <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> publish many additional reports and information on buses in London as well as for other public transport. <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> supply figures for their services, some of which run outside London. These are adjusted by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to cover the Greater London region only, based on figures for patronage on cross-boundary services also supplied by <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>. Where it is clear that operators have not reported boardings for <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> services which they operate in areas outside London, these are added to the total journeys outside London.</p>

<p><abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> publish a large amount of information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/" rel="external">bus journeys</a>. As such they publish many additional reports and information on buses in London as well as for other public transport.</p>

<p>Many local authorities also publish information on buses in their area, but this varies by local authority. <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> use their own ticketing machines on all tendered services, and they collate all the data centrally, as well as carrying out additional surveys.</p>

<p>More detailed information relating to bus travel in London can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/buses-performance-data" rel="external"><abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The National Travel Survey (<abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr>)</strong></p>

<p>Is a household survey of personal travel by residents of England travelling within Great Britain, from data collected via interviews and a 7-day travel diary The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> provides data on travel by bus including information on the characteristics of bus users (for example by age, gender, car ownership) and take-up of concessionary travel.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr> covers all modes of personal travel and therefore allows bus travel to be compared with other modes and the mode share to be estimated. It also provides alternative measures of bus patronage.</p>

<p>Data from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics"><abbr title="National Travel Survey">NTS</abbr></a> have been designated as National Statistics.</p>

The Labour Force Survey is used in the statistical release to provide information on bus and coach staff and drivers in addition to average weekly earnings and hours worked from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).</p>

<p><strong>Public transport support and concessionary travel reimbursement data</strong></p>

<p>Is taken from local government finance returns, published (in England) by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-authority-revenue-expenditure-and-financing">Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government (MHCLG)</a>.

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p><strong>Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) operator</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of these statistics, these are licensed operators of Public Service Vehicles in Tax Classes 34 and 38 using buses, minibuses or coaches for public service (which include local bus services, school services, long-distance coaching, tours, excursions and private hire). Taxi services and any work not intended for carrying passengers are excluded.</p>

<p><strong>Local bus service</strong></p>

<p>Local services are scheduled stopping services registered with the Traffic Commissioner. School bus services should be included if the service is registered as a local service available to the general public and it is eligible for Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG).</p>

<p>In Greater London, local services include tendered services for Transport for London or those run with a London Service Permit. Outside London, local services include commercial, tendered and de-minimis local bus services including those supported by Rural Bus Subsidy Grant or Challenge funding.</p>

<p><strong>Non-local services</strong></p>

<p>These include (the non-registered parts of) scheduled coach services, school contracts where the service cannot be used by fare-paying members of the public at bus stops, private hire where the vehicle is hired in advance and pre-booked tours. Only work done in Great Britain is included.</p>

<p><strong>Passenger journeys</strong></p>

<p>A count of the total number of boardings of each vehicle, so a trip which requires a change from one bus to another would be counted as two journeys in these figures. Figures do not include children under 5 years of age.</p>

<p><strong>Concessionary passengers</strong></p>

<p>This category covers all passengers (elderly, disabled and youth) where operators receive full or partial fare reimbursement from local authorities as part of a statutory or non-statutory concessionary travel scheme. Commercial concessions which may be offered by some operators (for example, free travel for their staff) are excluded.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle mileage and kilometres (local bus services)</strong></p>

<p>Mileage (kilometres) operated on local bus service. This includes only ‘live’ (for example, service) miles and not ‘dead’ running from depots to the start of a route.</p>

<p><strong>Subsidised services (also called tendered or supported services)</strong></p>

<p>These services are those that receive local authority support for all or part of their operation, normally where there is insufficient commercial demand to sustain the service without such support.</p>

<p>Examples will include school routes, evening services on certain routes, or socially necessary services in communities where buses would not otherwise call. They are awarded following competitive tendering or run for local authorities under de-minimis arrangements.</p>

<h3>Local bus patronage and mileage: 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 (voluntary questions)</h3>

<p>As in previous years, the department will be publishing bus patronage figures at local authority level, compiled from operator returns, which are published together with local authorities own figures where available in table <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys">BUS0109</a> on our bus statistics pages.</p>

<p>The department also publishes local authority level estimates of vehicle miles on local bus services (split by local authority supported and commercial) in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus02-vehicle-distance-travelled">BUS0208</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we would be grateful if you could complete the following voluntary questions (not part of the single data list) which will help us to make sure that the figures we have for your area are as accurate as possible.</p>
