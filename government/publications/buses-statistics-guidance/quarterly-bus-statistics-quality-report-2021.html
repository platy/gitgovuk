<p><strong>About this release</strong></p>

<p>This document supports the latest quarterly bus statistics.</p>

<p>The quarterly release includes data on passenger numbers and bus fare levels.</p>
</div>

<h2>About local bus statistics</h2>

<p>The quarterly bus statistics release is compiled from surveys of a sample of local bus operators that collect information on passenger journeys and fare changes during each quarter.</p>

<h2>Quality of the quarterly bus data</h2>

<p>The quarterly bus statistics release is produced to high professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Statistics, and were confirmed as National Statistics in February 2013.</p>

<p>This report outlines some of the quality aspects of the data.</p>

<h2>Quarterly panel survey of passenger numbers</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The quarterly bus panel is a quarterly survey of the 18 largest non-metropolitan operators, Passenger Transport Executives (for the metropolitan areas) and Transport for London. The quarterly panel survey covers over 90% of the journeys made in Great Britain. The survey provides quarterly estimates of passenger journeys figures (given in Table <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys">BUS0106</a>) and the first provisional estimate of the annual figure (for example, the 2011 to 2012 figure can be estimated when data up to quarter 1 (January to March), 2012 have been collected). Figures provided by operators are aggregated by type of area.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p><strong>Long-term and continuous</strong></p>

<p>The first quarterly panel survey covered the period from April to June 2004 and the survey has been running on a quarterly basis since.</p>

<p><strong>More frequent</strong></p>

<p>The quarterly panel collects data more frequently than the annual public service vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) survey. As a result the publication of these statistics is more timely. The quarterly also allows for analysis of seasonal trends in local bus passenger journeys.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p><strong>Coverage:</strong> The quarterly panel is based on a sample of the largest local bus operators. Although over 90% of bus journeys in Great Britain are covered by the quarterly panel, the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey provides better coverage as it aims to cover more journeys and many smaller operators.</p>

<p><strong>Subject to revision:</strong> The quarterly panel figures are adjusted to be consistent with the annual figures from the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> Survey once they become available. Quarterly estimates are therefore subject to future revision following publication of the annual estimates. As new data becomes available the seasonal adjustment can also cause changes to the way passenger journeys are distributed within each year, although this will not cause the overall annual totals to change.</p>

<p><strong>Journeys not passengers:</strong> The survey captures the number of passenger boardings, or journeys. This is not the same as the number of passengers as one passenger may make multiple trips.</p>

<p><strong>Journey details:</strong> While the survey captures the number of passenger boardings, it does not capture detailed information about the journeys, such as the origin and destination, or purpose of the journey.</p>

<p><strong>Passenger details:</strong> The survey does not capture any details of the people using local bus services, such as their demographics, journey satisfaction, or the reasons behind their travel mode choice.</p>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

<p>As National Statistics, the quarterly panel statistics are produced to high professional standards as set out in the Code of Practice for Statistics and many quality control measures are in place to ensure the integrity of the data.</p>

<p>Data collection is carried out using Excel spreadsheets and email returns.</p>

<p>Validation checks are used to ensure that any large changes compared with previous quarters are investigated. Returns are validated by comparison with the same quarter in previous years and seeking explanation where differences are large or unexpected.</p>

<p>Figures are seasonally adjusted using the X12 ARIMA software package. Seasonal adjustment aims to remove seasonal changes in the data from one quarter to the next so that overall trends can be seen more clearly in the data. Non seasonally adjusted data is also published as this provides a clearer picture of where demand for bus services falls throughout the year. The charts below show the difference between the seasonally adjusted and non seasonally adjusted data.</p>

<p><strong>Respondent burden</strong></p>

<p>Respondent burden has not been assessed for the quarterly panel survey as returns are not submitted in a standard format. However, returns are generally based on management information already held by operators which will help to minimise respondent burden. As a result we estimate the return takes an average of 15 minutes to complete.</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness</strong></p>

<p>The statistical release is generally published around 3 months after the end of the reference period.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>Because the local bus sector is dominated by relatively few large operators, most of whom provide data, sampling errors (that is random fluctuations due to selecting only a sample of operators) are very small in relation to other non-sampling errors (for example, inaccurate data provided by operators). However, quarterly passenger journey figures should be viewed as estimates as they are based on data from a smaller sample of operators which is then scaled up to be consistent with annual figures (see the section on other data sources below for information on the annual <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey). There remains the possibility that the data captured is incorrect. Respondents may make an error when completing the return or there may be errors in the underlying data. Our quality assurance procedures attempt to mitigate these errors, although they cannot entirely remove this risk.</p>

<h3>Other data sources</h3>

<p><strong>Annual Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) Survey</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey collects more detailed information about the local bus sector, including the estimated annual number of passenger journeys on local bus services. The quarterly estimates are constrained to these annual total figures, as the <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> survey covers a greater number of journeys and operators.</p>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p><strong>Public Service Vehicle (<abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr>) operator</strong></p>

<p>For the purposes of these statistics, these are licensed operators of Public Service Vehicles in Tax Classes 34 and 38 using buses, minibuses or coaches for public service (which include local bus services, school services, long distance coaching, tours, excursions and private hire). Taxi services and any work not intended for carrying passengers is excluded.</p>

<p><strong>Local bus service</strong></p>

<p>Local services are scheduled stopping services registered with the Traffic Commissioner. School bus services should be included if the service is registered as a local service available to the general public and it is eligible for Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG). In Greater London, local services include tendered services for Transport for London or those run with a London Service Permit. Outside London, local services include commercial, tendered and de-minimis local bus services including those supported by Rural Bus Subsidy Grant or Challenge funding.</p>

<p><strong>Passenger journeys</strong></p>

<p>A count of the total number of boardings of each vehicle, so a trip which requires a change from one bus to another would be counted as two journeys in these figures. Figures do not include children under 5 years of age.</p>

<h2>Bus fares survey</h2>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The fares survey covers changes in fares on local bus services in Great Britain, split by region. Data for the bus fares index is collected through a sample survey of around 100 operators and <abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>.</p>

<p>The index measures change in the gross yield. This is the change in passenger receipts (excluding concessionary fare reimbursement and subsidies from government) which would result from a fares change, assuming no change in passenger numbers. Operators supply information each quarter.</p>

<p>Annual indices for groups of operators in different areas of Great Britain are obtained by averaging changes, using weights based on receipts from passengers from the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> <abbr title="Public Service Vehicle">PSV</abbr> annual survey.</p>

<h3>Strengths of the data</h3>

<p>In total the operators selected cover around 85% of passenger receipts in Great Britain, and the sample design ensures operators in each area are adequately represented. A copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">survey form</a> is available.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The index has been compiled on a broadly consistent basis for many years and so should measure trends consistently. However, data on actual fare levels are not collected. The index assumes no change in passenger behaviour and therefore may not reflect changes in the average fare actually paid (for example if passengers switch to a different ticket type, or choose not to travel, as a result of fare changes).</p>

<p>The survey is based on a sample of operators but the coverage in terms of passenger receipts is high, around 85%.</p>

<h3>Data quality</h3>

<p>The index is intended to measure the change in the average cost to the fare paying passenger. In practice as cash-less transactions become more common (for example, pre-paid travel passes) the index can only give a broad guide to fare changes. Fare changes outside London are frequent, so adjustments must be made to the index each quarter. Bus fare changes in London usually take place once a year, in January.</p>

<h3>Other dimensions of quality</h3>

<p><strong>Response rate</strong></p>

<p>The survey response rate is high, in the latest survey 86% which accounted for 87% of the weight for the calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Respondent burden</strong></p>

<p>Respondent burden has not been assessed for the fares survey. The work to estimate the effect of fare change based on previous quantities will depend on the systems and practices of individual operators. Where no fare change has occurred the burden is negligible, respondents simply log in to report no change. As such the average burden per response is reduced. If an operator changes fares in only one quarter of a year then even a difficult calculation process requiring an hour of work will result in an average response burden of around 15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Timeliness</strong></p>

<p>The statistical release is generally published around three months after the end of the reference period.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>The individual figures reported by operators are calculated using their internal systems and so are based on the financial records of the individual firm. Combining this internal data into a single measure to report may be complicated by different payment options and ticket types. Operators are provided with guidance on calculating their return.</p>

<h3>Change in fares methodology</h3>

<p>From 2011 the calculation of the bus fares index included an adjustment to account for the change in the state pension age and resulting eligibility for concessionary travel. If fares are stable this adjustment will produce a small increase, to reflect the people not receiving concessionary travel because of the change in eligibility.</p>

<p>A copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-pension-age-timetable">timetable changes</a> is available.</p>

<p>This calculation has now been updated to better capture the changes over time and differences in local policies. As a result, the time series has been revised from 2011.</p>

<p>A copy of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/buses-statistics-guidance">2011 Review of the Bus Fares Index</a> is available.</p>

<p>There are 4 stages of changes to State Pension Age:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Stage 1 - Womenâs State Pension age under the Pensions Act 1995</strong></p>

<p>From May 2010 to March 2016, equalisation of womenâs pension age began moving from 60 to 63.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Stage 2 - Changes under the Pensions Act 2011</strong></p>

<p>From July 2016 to November 2018, the equalisation was sped up increasing from 63 to 65.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Stage 3 - Increase in State Pension age from 65 to 66, men and women</strong></p>

<p>From March 2019 to September 2020 everyone had State Pension Age increase from 65 to 66.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Stage 4 - In 2026, State Pension Age will begin increasing from 67 to 68.</strong></p>

<p>The original adjustment used an estimated proportion, to account for bus passengers affected.</p>
</div>

<p>This adjustment proportion was split and applied to each month of data in the underlying calculation to represent people reaching the relevant ages.</p>

<p>The proportion to apply was estimated using data from bus statistics, concessionary travel statistics and the National Travel Survey. The proportion of OAP concessionary bus journeys by different age groups was calculated based on the number of âboardingsâ (number of buses used) and the ticket type for bus travel recorded in the travel diary. The proportion for people aged 60 to 64 years was divided by 5 (estimating the proportion a single year age band) and divided again by 2 (because the early change only affected women).</p>

<p>A separate adjustment figure was generated for each grouping: London, English Metropolitan and English Non-Metropolitan. Scotland and Wales figures were not adjusted because eligibility here did not change. This was then split across each month of data and applied to all index calculations from March 2011.</p>

<p>The updated adjustment includes separate figures for each group but changes over time. The concessionary travel policies for the Local Authorities in each group have also been factored in, weighted by the volume of passenger journeys, based on responses to the annual Concessionary Travel Survey (CT Survey) of Travel Concession Authorities (TCAs).</p>

<p>From 2011 to 2019 the estimated impact based on all people of the relevant age is halved to provide a figure for women as the pension ages converged. For 2020, this is removed because changes apply to men and women equally. The adjustment will be removed from 2021 until further changes take effect.</p>

<p>Over short time scales the differences between the revised index and the previously published figures are small. The table below compares figures for June 2020 from the base of March 2005. The largest difference is for London due to concessionary travel being provided to the over 60s, removing the effect of changes in the state pension age.</p>
