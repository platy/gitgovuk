<h4>Infection prevention and control allocation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The total grant (£237m) is split at a national level between (i) care homes combined with residential drug and alcohol settings, (ii) community care providers and (iii) a discretionary amount for each local authority to choose where to allocate it. 52.5% is allocated on the basis of the number of care home beds for care homes plus the maximum number of service users for residential drug and alcohol settings. 17.5% is allocated on the basis of users supported by community care providers. 30% is allocated as a discretionary amount on the basis of the combined distributions used for community care and care homes plus residential drug and alcohol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for care homes and residential drug and alcohol settings are calculated as [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users * Area Cost Adjustment)] / England sum of [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users times Area Cost Adjustment)]. (A)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for community care providers are calculated as [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment] / England sum of [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment]. (B)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The allocation share for each local authority's discretionary amount are calculated as [Allocation Amount for Care Homes and Residential Drug and Alcohol Settings + Allocation Amount for Community Care] / [Total Allocation Amount for Care Homes and Residential Drug and Alcohol Settings + Total Allocation Amount for Community Care]. (C)</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> reflects differences in wages and prices in different local authorities.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vaccines allocation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The total grant (£25m) is split at a national level between (i) care homes combined with residential drug and alcohol settings, (ii) community care providers and (iii) a discretionary amount for each local authority to choose where to allocate it. 35% is allocated on the basis of the number of care home beds for care homes plus the maximum number of service users for residential drug and alcohol settings. 35% is allocated on the basis of users supported by community care providers. 30% is allocated as a discretionary amount on the basis of the combined distributions used for community care and care homes plus residential drug and alcohol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for care homes and residential drug and alcohol settings are calculated as [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users* Area Cost Adjustment)] / England sum of [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users* Area Cost Adjustment)]. (H)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for community care providers are calculated as [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment] / England sum of [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment]. (I)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation share for each local authority's discretionary amount are calculated as [Allocation Amount for Care Homes and Residential Drug and Alcohol Settings + Allocation Amount for Community Care] / [Total Allocation Amount for Care Homes and Residential Drug and Alcohol Settings + Total Allocation Amount for Community Care]. (J)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Area Cost Adjustment">ACA</abbr> reflects differences in wages and prices in different local authorities</p>

<p>Each local authority has received an allocation of funding that has been specifically made available to support care providers and social care staff with the costs associated with accessing COVID-19 and flu vaccinations. Indicative allocations for this portion of the funding can be found in the table of allocations at annex B of the local authority circular.</p>

<h4>Testing allocation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The total grant (£126.3m) is split at a national level between (i) care homes combined with residential drug and alcohol settings and (ii) community care providers. 70% is allocated on the basis of the number of care home beds for care homes plus the maximum number of service users for residential drug and alcohol settings. 30% is allocated on the basis of users supported by community care providers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for care homes and residential drug and alcohol settings are calculated as [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users * Area Cost Adjustment)] / England sum of [(Number of care home beds * Area Cost Adjustment) + (Maximum Number of Residential Drug and Alcohol Service Users * Area Cost Adjustment)]. (E)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The allocation shares for each local authority for community care providers are calculated as [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment] / England sum of [Number of community care users * Area Cost Adjustment]. (F)</p>

<p>Northamptonshire County Council was restructured into North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire on 1 April 2021.</p>

<h4>PCR testing</h4>

<p>Support for the costs associated with PCR testing for community care providers is included in the 30% discretionary allocation for testing funding. Therefore, local authorities are asked to use this discretionary amount to provide funding to community care providers for this purpose.</p>

<p>We know from reporting against the extended Infection Control Fund that around £2.3 million per month was spent on this measure between January and March 2021. We have included an indicative distribution of how these costs could be distributed, to aid local authorities in determining how much funding to provide from this allocation. As this is indicative, we are aware this may not be fully reflective of local pressures which local authorities should consider when distributing discretionary funding to different parts of the sector.</p>

<p>Column D is the total amount allocated to each local authority from the Infection Prevention and Control allocation. Column G is the total amount allocated to each local authority from the testing allocation. Column K is the total amount allocated to each local authority from the Vaccine allocation. Column L is the total amount allocated to each local authority from the Infection Prevention and Control allocation, the testing allocation and Vaccine allocation combined.</p>
