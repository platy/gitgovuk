<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Infants born to hepatitis B virus (<abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr>) infected mothers are at high risk of acquiring <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> infection themselves, particularly if the mother has a high level of <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> and hepatitis B e antigen (<abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr>) in her plasma. Without intervention the risk of transmission from an <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> seropositive mother is 70% to 90% compared with the risk of about 10% from an <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> negative mother <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref1"><sup>[1 to 3]</sup></a>.</p>

<h2>Role of post-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title="post-exposure prophylaxis">PEP</abbr>)</h2>

<p>A combination of various doses of hepatitis B vaccine and human anti-HBs immunoglobulin (<abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr>) has been shown in many studies in Europe <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref4"><sup>[4 to 6]</sup></a> and elsewhere <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> to be highly effective in reducing vertical transmission from chronically infected women. Studies with groups given recombinant vaccine starting at birth at a dose of 5 micrograms or more, have suggested protective efficacy levels above 90% even without the use additional <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref8"><sup>[8 to 10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>A review in 1994 concluded that the factors which influence protection are vaccine dose, starting immunisation at birth and completing the course of immunisation. Studies in <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> seropositive women have suggested that the development of chronic infection in the infant – that is vaccine failure – is associated with high maternal viral load; the role of specific viral mutations is less certain <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref11"><sup>[11 to 13]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The vast majority of these studies were limited to term infants born to <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> seropositive women and so provide little evidence for the effectiveness of <abbr title="post-exposure prophylaxis">PEP</abbr> in babies of anti-HBe positive women. Studies of infants born to anti-HBe positive women suggest that the development of chronic infection is uncommon, even in those given vaccine alone <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref4"><sup>[4 to 5]</sup></a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The UK recommendation is therefore that such infants should only receive vaccine, without additional <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr>.</p>

<p>The lack of evidence for the additional benefit of immunoglobulin in such infants was recently restated in a systematic review <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>. Studies in pre-term infants are limited to those that document the immune response to vaccine and no data on the effectiveness of <abbr title="post-exposure prophylaxis">PEP</abbr> in premature infants exists.</p>

<p>The early response to hepatitis B vaccination, however, is known to be lower in pre-term than term infants <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> although final response rates are comparable. Since 2006, as a precautionary measure, <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> has been recommended, in addition to vaccination, in very premature infants born to any <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> infected woman <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>

<h2>Current policy and procedures</h2>

<p>Since April 2000 it has been recommended that all pregnant women in England and Wales should be offered testing for hepatitis B through screening for <abbr title="hepatitis B surface antigen">HBsAg</abbr>, and that all babies of <abbr title="hepatitis B surface antigen">HBsAg</abbr> seropositive women should be immunised (HSC 1998/127) <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>A dose of paediatric hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants born to an <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> infected mother as soon as possible after birth, then at 1 and 2, and 12 months of age. For the ‘high-risk’ infants <a class="govuk-link" href="#box1"><sup>[Box 1]</sup></a>) of <abbr title="hepatitis B surface antigen">HBsAg</abbr> seropositive mothers, 200 IU <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> is recommended by deep intramuscular injection as soon as possible after birth, not later than 48 hours <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Box 1</h3>

<p>The following infants are considered ‘high-risk’ and should receive both vaccine and HBIG (2006):</p>

<ul>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and HBeAg positive</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and HBeAg/anti-HBe negative</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and e markers are not available</li>
  <li>mother has acute hepatitis B in pregnancy.</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and infant is born weighing 1,500g or less</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Infants of ‘low-risk’ <abbr title="hepatitis B surface antigen">HBsAg</abbr> seropositive mothers with a birth weight above 1,500g should receive vaccine alone as soon as possible after birth, then at 1 and 2, and 12 months of age.</p>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) holds supplies of <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> and issues each dose in readiness for the birth of a named baby to a ‘high-risk’ woman. The infant is then followed via the GP or paediatrician and the immunisation dates and results of testing collected.</p>

<p>For ‘low-risk’ women, follow up is usually by paediatric specialist or general practitioner and local coordination and audit is recommended <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of the current policy</h2>

<p>An HPA audit of infants eligible for <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> in the UK confirmed chronic infection in around 26/543 (4.9%) of their infants rate despite receiving <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> and vaccination <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The chance of a baby becoming infected with hepatitis B depended on year of birth, maternal <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> status and ethnic group. There was a higher risk of infection in the babies born to mothers who were <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> seropositive and anti-HBe seronegative compared with other groups eligible for <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> (see above). The role of gestational age or birthweight was not examined.</p>

<p>A more recent audit of <abbr title="hepatitis B surface antigen">HBsAg</abbr> seropositive women in Bradford documented chronic infection in 4/57 (7%) infants born to <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> positive women compared to 0/219 (0%) infants born to anti-HBe positive women who were given vaccine alone (personal communication, Leema Inamdar). In addition to infants who developed chronic infection, only a small proportion of babies had convincing evidence of resolved infection (an anti-HBc inhibition of 90% or above).</p>

<p>In total the transmission rate in was 11/57 (19%) and 1/211 (0.5%) in babies born to <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> seropositive and anti-HBe positive women respectively.</p>

<p>The single infection detected in the child of an anti-HBe positive woman was vaccinated on the date of birth but the second dose was delayed to 7 weeks of age. This suggests that vaccination alone is sufficient to largely prevent transmission and therefore to prevent cases of both chronic and acute infection in infants born to anti-HBe positive women. This data supports the effectiveness of the current UK policy when correctly implemented.</p>

<p>Other UK audits of the programme show a wide range of vaccine coverage and timeliness of vaccine administration <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref20"><sup>[20 to 23]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Two evaluations in inner city districts with high population mobility and relatively high <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> prevalence managed to achieve 90% coverage for 3 doses of vaccine, but routine data submitted from 121 English PCTs to the HPA suggests that only 70% of eligible children have received 3 doses of vaccine by the age of one year <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Nearly all published evaluations have failed to document follow up blood testing of a representative sample of the at-risk population. Improving the coverage of immunisation and follow up testing is therefore clearly a priority for local resource allocation.</p>

<h2>The role of viral load testing</h2>

<p>Over recent years, viral load testing has become a common investigation in the management of chronically infected individuals. Many antenatal women may have been assessed prior to pregnancy or, if identified during pregnancy, are now being assessed before delivery. This has raised the question of whether infants born to anti-HBe seropositive <abbr title="hepatitis B virus">HBV</abbr> infected women with high viral loads should be considered for <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr>.</p>

<p>Based on the evidence outlined above there is no compelling case to offer <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> to the infants of anti-HBe positive women, and therefore no case for recommending routine viral load testing in pregnancy. However, it is recognised that for women who have viral loads measured for their own management, a small number will be found to have levels approaching those in <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> positive women.</p>

<p>It is therefore proposed to permit the use of <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> in infants of women who are found to have viral load equal to or above 1 x 10<sup>6</sup>  IU/ml. This level correlates well with <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> status in one London study <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and equates to a level of around 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> copies/ml which correlated with <abbr title="hepatitis B e antigen">HBeAg</abbr> status in the review for the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) policy on infected health care workers <a class="govuk-link" href="#ref26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>. From 1 September 2008, <abbr title="hepatitis B immunoglobulin">HBIG</abbr> will therefore be issued by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> for the following babies <a class="govuk-link" href="#box2"><sup>[Box 2]</sup></a>).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Box 2</h3>

<p>The following infants are considered ‘high-risk’ and should receive both vaccine and HBIG (2008):</p>

<ul>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and HBeAg positive</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and HBeAg/anti-HBe negative</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and e markers are not available</li>
  <li>mother has acute hepatitis B in pregnancy</li>
  <li>mother is HBsAg seropositive and infant is born weighing 1,500g or less</li>
</ul>

<p>A woman who is HBsAg seropositive and known to have an HBV DNA level equal to or above 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> IU/ml in an antenatal sample*</p>

<p>*Please note UKHSA is not advising routine viral load testing to inform the management of the infant.</p>
