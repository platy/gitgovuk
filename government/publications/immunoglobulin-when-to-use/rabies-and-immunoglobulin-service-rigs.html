<p>The Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service (<abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr>) at UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Colindale is a cross-divisional service supporting the post-exposure treatment of serious infections, through the development of guidance, provision of clinical advice and issuing of immunoglobulins and anti-toxins following a detailed risk assessment.</p>

<p>This includes post exposure treatment and clinical management for rabies and botulism (TARGET – Tuberculosis, Acute Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Emerging/Zoonotic Infections and Travel Health Division), hepatitis A and B (BSHSH – Blood Safety, Hepatitis, Sexually-transmitted Infections and <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> Division) and measles, chickenpox and diphtheria (Imms – Immunisation and Countermeasures Division).</p>

<p><abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> staff comprise a multi-disciplinary team of nurses, a business manager and administrative support; they are hosted in Immunisation under a consultant virologist. Expert guidance and medical support is provided by consultants from each of the divisions responsible for their specific topic area.</p>

<p>Immunoglobulins and anti-toxins are rare products that are centrally procured by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> from a range of manufacturers. Stock is held centrally at Movianto, UK on behalf of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, but also at a number of stockholders distributed throughout the country.</p>

<p><abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> is a busy service; in the financial year 2019 to 2020 there were more than 4,000 calls; over 3,400 related to rabies prophylaxis or post-exposure treatment, about 250 calls related to hepatitis and more than 400 calls relating to varicella zoster or measles.</p>

<h2>Routine service</h2>

<p><abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> operates between 8am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday. All requests for replacement vaccine and advice about issuing should be directed to this service (Tel: 0330 128 1020).</p>

<p>Requests for immunoglobulin/vaccine Monday to Friday will be ordered through Movianto for delivery to a named responsible clinician to arrive the next working day before 2pm. However, there may occasionally be specific urgent situations where <abbr title="Human Rabies Immunoglobulin">HRIG</abbr> is needed sooner than this, and in these circumstances <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> can issue immunoglobulin through a more rapid delivery.</p>

<h2>Out of hours service</h2>
<p>Clinical advice is available through the Colindale Duty Doctor service, between 9am and 7pm at weekends and bank holidays. Most calls can wait until the next day, so callers after 5:30pm are encouraged to call back the next morning to speak to <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> or the Colindale Duty Doctor service (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). Vaccine should be sourced locally, and will be replaced through <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> the next working day. There is no need to talk to the <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> team or Colindale before arranging this.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Human Rabies Immunoglobulin">HRIG</abbr> is required out of working hours and cannot wait until the next working day, the product may be able to be collected from a local stock-holder or be issued out of hours for delivery the next day. Arrangements for urgent delivery on non-working days should be made by calling the Duty Doctor between 9am and 7pm.</p>
