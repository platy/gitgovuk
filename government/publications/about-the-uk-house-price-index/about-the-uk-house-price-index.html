<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK House Price Index (<abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>) captures changes in the value of residential properties.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> uses sales data collected on residential housing transactions, whether for cash or with a mortgage. Properties have been included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in England and Wales since January 1995</li>
  <li>in Scotland since January 2004</li>
  <li>in Northern Ireland since January 2005</li>
</ul>

<p>Data is available at a national and regional level, as well as counties, local authorities and London boroughs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> National Statistic</h3>

<p>The Office for Statistics Regulation designated the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> as a National Statistic in September 2018. This means it meets the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and value, compliant with the Code of Practice. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/uk-house-price-index-statistics-national-statistics-confirmation/" rel="external">letter from the Director General for Regulation</a> details the actions that were taken to meet the requirements as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/uk-and-northern-ireland-house-price-indices-phase-2-hm-land-registry-and-partners/" rel="external"><abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> assessment report</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> is a joint production by HM Land Registry, Land and Property Services Northern Ireland, Office for National Statistics and Registers of Scotland.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>, introduced in June 2016, includes all residential properties purchased for market value in the UK. However, as sales only appear in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> once the purchases have been registered, there can be a delay before transactions feed into the index. As such, caution is advised when interpreting price changes in the most recent periods as they can be revised. Further information is provided in our revision policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Strengths and limitations</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> is not as timely in publishing as other house price index measures published in the UK because it is based on completed sales at the end of the conveyancing process, rather than advertised or approved prices.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> has wide coverage of both cash and mortgage transactions and a large data source (land registrations such as that maintained by HM Land Registry) allowing data to be published down to a local authority level with further breakdowns available by property type, buyer status, funding status and property status.</p>

<p>Estimates for the most recent months are provisional and are likely to be updated as more data is incorporated into the index. While changes to estimates are small at the headline level, these can be larger at lower geographies due to the fewer transactions used. Further details on why our estimates change can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#monthly-revision">revisions policy</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Data sources</h2>

<p>The main sources of price paid data used in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> are HM Land Registry for England and Wales, Registers of Scotland and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Stamp Duty Land Tax data for the Northern Ireland House Price Index.</p>

<p>Each data source has been assessed against the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD) toolkit. Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/uk-house-price-index-quality-assurance-of-administrative-data">summary of <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> QAAD</a> or see below for individual reports.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> HM Land Registry for England and Wales</h3>

<p>Information on residential property transactions for England and Wales, collected as part of the official registration process, will be provided by HM Land Registry for properties that are sold for full market value. The dataset contains the sale price of the property, the date when the sale was completed, full address details, the type of property (such as detached, semi-detached, terraced or flat), if it is a newly built property or an established residential building and a variable to indicate if the property has been purchased as a financed transaction (for example using a mortgage) or as a non-financed transaction (cash purchase).</p>

<p>All this information is currently published by HM Land Registry in its Price Paid Dataset (PPD), with the exception of the funding status indicator. This is not publicly available as this data is considered personal information and would breach data protection rules.</p>

<h4>Data exclusions</h4>

<p>There are a number of registrations excluded from the version of the Price Paid Data (PPD) used in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all commercial transactions</li>
  <li>sales that were not for full market value</li>
  <li>transfers, conveyances, assignments or leases at a premium with nominal rent which are:
    <ul>
      <li>‘Right to buy’ sales at a discount</li>
      <li>subject to an existing mortgage</li>
      <li>to effect the sale of a share in a property</li>
      <li>by way of a gift</li>
      <li>under a Compulsory Purchase order</li>
      <li>under a court order</li>
      <li>to Trustees appointed under Deed of appointment</li>
      <li>Vesting Deeds Transmissions or Assents</li>
      <li>of more than one property</li>
      <li>leases for seven years or less</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Registers of Scotland</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ros.gov.uk/" rel="external">Registers of Scotland (RoS)</a> provides residential property sales for Scotland in the calculation of the new UK House Price Index (HPI). The Scotland data follows a similar process to the HM Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) where the data provided for the HPI is a by-product of the Scottish property registration process, whereby property sales are submitted to RoS on completion of a sale. Data is gathered from these applications and entered into the RoS Land Registration System (LRS). A weekly extract of all sales data is then taken from LRS and undergoes a quality assurance process to check the price paid, date of entry, property type (land, commercial, residential, forestry, agricultural and other) and to identify market value residential sales (as opposed to non-market sales similar to those detailed for PPD). This data is then combined with further details, such as full address and house type (detached, semi-detached, terrace or flat), using the RoS Geographical Information System database to provide a comprehensive source of data that can be provided each month for use in the new HPI.</p>

<p>In addition, a funding status indicator and a new build indicator are also added to the final dataset. The funding status indicator is identified by whether the application for registration of a market value residential sale also contaisn an application for registration of a standard security mortgage deed. All applications with a mortgage deed, or where the mortgage deed is submitted within three months of the sale, are mortgage sales, while all those without an accompanying mortgage deed, are marked as being a cash sale. The new build indicator is given to every sale of an individual property from a builder’s development title. 
The coverage of the RoS data differs to the PPD slightly in that transactions relating to residential properties where the buyer or seller is a corporate body, company or business are included within this dataset.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Northern Ireland data</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/land-property-services-lps" rel="external">Land &amp; Property Services/Northern Ireland Statistics &amp; Research Agency</a> house price index will continue to be calculated and published quarterly. Northern Ireland data will be provided to the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) quarterly, and will be combined with the Great Britain data to give overall figures for the UK. The overall UK figure will be calculated by keeping the house prices in Northern Ireland constant for the two months following the end of a quarter, when Northern Ireland results for the most recent quarter are not yet available. They will then be revised when the quarter is complete.</p>

<p>The quality assessment of Stamp Duty Land Tax data from HMRC is not yet complete.  Details will be made available once the assessment is finalised.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> UK Finance – Regulated Mortgage Survey</h3>

<p>The Regulated Mortgage Survey (RMS) is UK Finance’s version of the Mortgage Product Sales Data (PSD) that all regulated lenders report to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This is detailed transaction-level data on mortgage completions. Starting in April 2005, the RMS now contains over 12 million individual mortgage sale records.</p>

<p>It is collected electronically, with all reporting firms submitting according to FCA-defined data definitions, and in a standard xml format, ensuring consistent data structure. Data coverage is estimated to be around 95% of all regulated mortgages currently advanced. However, some lenders do not permit their data to be transferred to third parties, like <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, so the share of the market covered by data received by <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> is about 70%.</p>

<p>Reporting fields include purchase price, completion date of property sale, type of borrower (first time buyer (<abbr title="first time buyer">FTB</abbr>) or home mover) new or second hand property, type and size of dwelling. The RMS is the only comprehensive source of data available for the type of borrower and provides the necessary data to allow the new HPI to be produced according to whether the buyer is a first time buyer or an existing owner. The RMS is also a key source of data used in the production of house prices for inclusion in the Retail Price Index and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Property attributes data</h2>

<p>There is comprehensive data available on the price of transacted property across the UK; however, this price data is limited in terms of details regarding the physical characteristics of the property.</p>

<p>The use of price data alone is insufficient for the calculation of an inflationary index for house prices due to the fact the composition and type of property sold can differ vastly between periods. Therefore, in line with recognised international best practice, hedonic regression and mix-adjustment is used to account for the change in composition.</p>

<p>For a hedonic regression model to be work sufficient, details regarding the attributes of properties sold are required to supplement the price paid data. For the production of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>, these attributes are available from a number of official sources described below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Valuation Office Agency Council Tax Valuation list</h3>

<p>The main source of property attributes data that will be used to supplement Price Paid Data (PPD) for England and Wales is administrative data taken from the Council Tax Valuation list maintained by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/valuation-office-agency">Valuation Office Agency (<abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> has been responsible for banding properties for Council Tax since the tax was first introduced in 1993; before then, the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> was responsible for the earlier system of domestic rates. The Council Tax Valuation list is a robust source of property attributes (such as the size of the property) data that covers, in principle, all residential properties in England and Wales.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Land and Property Services Northern Ireland Valuation List</h3>

<p>Land and Property Services maintains the list of Northern Ireland properties which are valued for rating purposes. The data are maintained and validated similarly to the <abbr title="Valuation Office Agency">VOA</abbr> data described above. The Valuation List database contains all the property attributes required for the hedonic regression used in the production of the Northern Ireland House Price Index (<abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Energy Performance Certificates Scotland</h3>

<p>Scottish Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) is used to provide the floor area of the property and the number of habitable rooms required for calculation of the new <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>. This will be matched against the price paid data provided by RoS (using the address details of the property).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Acorn classification</h3>

<p>A key determinant of house prices is the demographic characteristics of the area in which the property is located, such as the affluence of those people living in the area. A well-established geo-demographic segmentation of the UK is available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://acorn.caci.co.uk/what-is-acorn" rel="external">Acorn</a> dataset, produced and licensed by CACI Ltd. Acorn segments postcodes into categories and groups by analysing significant social factors and behaviours. The Acorn dataset is used in the calculation of both the NI House Price Index and the UK House Price Index.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Methodology</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> applies a hedonic regression model that utilises the various sources of data on property price (for example the Price Paid dataset) and attributes to produce up-to-date estimates of the change in house prices each period.</p>

<p>More details on this approach can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/quality-and-methodology#methods-used-to-produce-the-uk-hpi">section 3 of our Quality and methodology document</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Geometric mean explained</h3>

<p>There are different ways of calculating average prices. These include the arithmetic mean (simple mean), the geometric mean and the median.</p>

<p>The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by the few high value properties and will therefore not give a true reflection of the average price of a standardised property.</p>

<p>The geometric mean reduces the weighting given to high value properties when compared to the arithmetic mean and is typically lower, usually closer to that of the median.</p>

<p>For the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>, the standard average house price is calculated by taking the average (geometric mean) price in January 2015 and then recalculating it in accordance with the index change back in time and forward to the present day.</p>

<p>A 3 month moving average has been applied to estimates below the regional level. For example, at the local authority level, the published estimate for March is a simple average of the calculated estimates for January, February and March. This helps remove some of the volatility in the series at this level. Volatility still remains in estimates for local authorities with fewer transactions, such as Shetland, Orkney City of London and Na h-Eileanan. Northern Ireland estimates are unaffected by this as they are only available on a quarterly basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Monthly and annual price changes</h3>

<p>The ‘annual’ percentage change in house prices is simply the price change relative to the same month twelve months earlier. For example, if the HPI release is for February, then the ‘annual’ price change reports the percentage change in values relative to February in the previous year.</p>

<p>This annual rate of price change reflects the best estimate for how much the value of a typical property has changed over the preceding twelve months. Similar to the ‘annual’ change, the ‘monthly’ percentage change estimates the percentage change in average house prices relative to the previous month.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Revisions to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data</h3>

<p>The amount of time between the sale of a property and the registration of this information varies. It typically ranges between 2 weeks and 2 months. Occasionally the interval between sale and registration is longer than two months; this is particularly true for new builds. For example, our provisional (first) estimate for a particular month is calculated on around 40% of the transactions that will ultimately get registered with the second and third estimates calculated based on around 80% and 85% of the final registered transactions. Revisions to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> estimates arise as the index is re-calculated to incorporate these additional transactions.</p>

<p>Transactions involving the creation of a new register, such as new builds, are more complex and an increase in applications has created a backlog. As a result, processing takes longer. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-annual-report-and-accounts-2017-to-2018/performance-report#brilliant-at-the-basics--by-design">what we’ve done to reduce our backlog</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-service-standards/our-service-standards">our service standards</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-business-strategy-2017-to-2022">our future plans</a>.</p>

<h4>Monthly revision</h4>

<p>As an example, in the June 2017 release, which contained data up to April 2017, average prices, indices, growth rates and sales volumes previously published for all months between April 2016 and March 2017 were revised. 
Northern Ireland quarterly data was revised back to Q2 (April to June) 2016. This may differ to the revision policy of the Northern Ireland House Price Index published by the Land and Property Services Northern Ireland</p>

<h4>Other revisions</h4>

<p>From time to time revisions will need to be made outside of the usual. Examples of such revisions include improvements to methodology, revisions to data and the discovery of incorrect data through extensive quality assurance procedures. 
Each of these revisions will be examined to see if the effects are significant in terms of the degree of change or whether the changes affect the story the data portray. If revisions arising through improvements to methodology or changes to source data are found to be insignificant, they will be introduced in the next planned set of revisions according to the timetable above.</p>

<p>However, if these revisions are thought to affect analysis or are sufficiently large, they will be introduced more quickly.</p>

<p>If incorrect data are discovered after publication, these too will be examined for their impact. Where the changes are significant, a correction notice will be issued as soon as is practicable, while minor corrections will be included in the next planned release. In all cases a full explanation will be included as part of the release.</p>

<p>To view the most recent monthly or ad-hoc revisions to previous data, see the tables provided on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-house-price-index-reports">data downloads pages</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Seasonal adjustments</h3>

<p>Seasonally adjusted series are calculated at the regional and national level only. These data can be found within the data tables.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Inflation</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> measures nominal house price changes and is not adjusted for inflation. Users of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> can make their own inflation assumptions and adjust the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Small local authority districts not shown on the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Due to the small volume of sales for these areas, the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> would not always provide a reliable measure of price movement. This may become possible as the amount of data increases.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> Recent volumes not reported</h3>

<p>There are partial sales volume data for the months immediately preceding the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> release. However this is not published because the data is not complete. We aim to report on accurate and reliable information and therefore do not want to release sales volume data that has the potential to be misleading if quoted out of context.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Repossessions</h2>

<p>Details of repossession sales are only available for England and Wales.</p>

<p>In August 2016, we began reporting on Repossession data for England and Wales for the month of April 2016.</p>

<p>For England, this is volumes of repossessions recorded by Government Office Region shown as a table and in a heat map. The data is also available to download as a .csv file.</p>

<p>For Wales, there is a headline figure for the number of repossessions recorded in Wales. This data is also included in the .csv file.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> The difference between the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> and others</h2>

<p>Currently, there are a number of different sources of house price statistics published in addition to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>. There will be differences in the data published by each source, as there are differences in both the data and methodology used. For example, Rightmove use asking prices, sources such as Nationwide and Halifax use their own mortgage approvals data, while the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> uses data at the end of the conveyancing process, calculated based on completed sales.</p>

<p>Find out about the difference between the various house price index measures and their strengths and limitations in our publication <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/comparing-house-price-indices-in-the-uk">Comparing house price indices in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Property Transaction Statistics published by HM Revenue &amp; Customs differ to those published as part of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> due to differences in coverage and timeliness of registration, although trends are similar.</p>

<h3>High level summary</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> is calculated based on completed sales at the end of the conveyancing process. This means that while the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> may not be as timely in publishing as the other measures, it is however ultimately more complete with coverage of both cash and mortgage transactions for the whole of the UK. The large data source used, land registrations (such as that maintained by HM Land Registry), allows data to be published down to a local authority level with further breakdowns available by property type, buyer status, funding status and property status.</p>

<h4>Halifax house price index and Nationwide house price index</h4>

<p>Both <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/media1/economic_insight/halifax_house_price_index_page.asp" rel="external" title="Halifax house price index">Halifax</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nationwide.co.uk/hpi/" rel="external" title="Nationwide house price index">Nationwide</a> produce house price indices based on their own mortgage approvals only and therefore will not include any cash transactions. They both have UK-wide coverage, and since the Halifax and Nationwide use only their own in-house data they can process them immediately and do not have to await the receipt of data from other lenders. This means that they are timelier than the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>.</p>

<h4>LSL Acadata house price index</h4>

<p>Similar to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> in data source. LSL Acadata (previously the LSL Property Services/Acadametrics) HPI is based on completed sales at the end of the conveyancing process using data from HM Land Registry for England and Wales. The HPI provides mix and seasonally adjusted results at national, regional and county or unitary district or London borough levels.</p>

<p>The index can be accessed at <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.acadata.co.uk/acadHousePrices.php" rel="external">Acadata</a>.</p>

<h4>Rightmove house price index</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/house-price-index/" rel="external">Rightmove index</a> includes all property types that are advertised on its website. However it includes houses that do not subsequently sell and reports only asking prices. If house price movements are different between the non-selling and selling houses then this will affect the accuracy of estimates of house prices and changes in them.</p>

<h4>Registers of Scotland official quarterly housing market statistics</h4>

<p>Registers of Scotland will continue to produce average house prices based on arithmetic means of these transactions, which is published as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ros.gov.uk/property-data/property-statistics/quarterly-house-price-statistics" rel="external">quarterly housing market statistics</a> in the second month after the month to which the figures refer to.</p>

<h4>House Price Statistics for Small Areas</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housepricestatisticsforsmallareas/previousReleases" rel="external">House Price Statistics for Small Areas</a> (HPSSAs) are published on a quarterly basis calculated based on HM Land Registry Price Paid data. HPSSA’s are not a house price index as they do not control for changes in the mix of properties over time (mix adjust), therefore they provide different figures to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>. They report non-adjusted average transaction values down to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/census/super-output-areas--soas-/index.html" rel="external">middle super output area</a>.</p>

<h4>HM Revenue &amp; Customs Property Transaction Statistics</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-40000-or-above">HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) data</a> are based on Stamp Duty Land Tax returns. Purchasers have 30 days from the date of completion to submit their land transaction return before incurring a penalty. This means that HMRC transaction volumes are more complete than those published in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> for recent months. Transaction volumes published by HMRC also differ in coverage to those published in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>.</p>

<p>We believe that the main reason for this difference is that residential properties where the buyer or seller is a corporate body, company or business are excluded from the HM Land Registry data in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> but included in HMRC property transaction statistics. <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data exclusions can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#data-sources">section 2</a>.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span> Data tables</h2>

<p>When the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data tables are published each month, they represent our best available view on historic house price movements at the time. As new information becomes available, the tables are revised to reflect any new data. Each month the new data will be added and the previous 12 months updated to reflect any additional sales added for those months.</p>

<p>As the NI House Price Index is published quarterly and sales data form the basis of future domestic revaluations, the NI price data series will be revised as and when necessary to take account of any new sales information received, therefore the most recently published data series from Jan 2005 should be used NI House Price Index from Q1 2005.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> How to access the data</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data is published monthly in CSV and linked data formats on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/uk-house-price-index" rel="external">data.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Seasonal adjustment</h3>

<p>The difference between the tables called Index and Index (Seasonally Adjusted):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Index table contains monthly residential property price index at regional, county/unitary authority and London borough level.</li>
  <li>the Index (SA) table contains seasonally adjusted monthly residential property price indices at regional and national level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span> Monthly change and annual change</h3>

<p>Data presented in the Monthly Change and Annual Change tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Monthly Change table contains monthly change figures which represent the month-to-month percentage change of the index.</li>
  <li>the Annual Change table contains annual change figures. These represent the percentage change in the index over the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.6 </span> Sales volumes table</h3>

<p>This table contains counts of all sales included in the electronic register at the time of data extraction. The data collection delay mainly affects the most recent months. The two most recent months are therefore omitted from this data to avoid reporting misleading volumes.</p>

<p>Sales volume data is also available by property status (new build and existing property) and funding status (cash and mortgage) in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-house-price-index-reports">downloadable data tables</a>. Transactions involving the creation of a new register, such as new builds, are more complex and require more time to process. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index#monthly-revision">Revisions to the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data</a> for more information.</p>

<p>As we are not able to identify the funding status of every property transaction sales volumes for cash/mortgage may not equal the total.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.7 </span> Levels at which the data is presented</h3>

  <li>‘Index’</li>
  <li>‘Annual Change’</li>
  <li>‘Average Prices’</li>
  <li>‘Sales Volumes’ are provided at national, regional, county/unitary authority, local authority and London borough level</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> How to view your results</h3>

<p>Our <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> data is presented at national, regional, county and borough or metropolitan district level. When you start typing the name of an area a drop-down list of available locations will appear. Select the preferred location from the list to start your search.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of the areas available for reporting on, use the map icon to view the different areas available.</p>

<p>You can compare up to 5 locations using the comparison tool.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span> Viewing results</h3>

<p>The search tool initially presents results for the UK for the previous 12 months showing the index, average price, volumes, percentage monthly and annual change in both tabular and graphic form. You can change the options (date, location, indicators and property types).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.6 </span> Available data</h3>

<p>All available data is now included in the search tool but not all data is available for all countries. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scotland and Northern Ireland data is not available at regional or county level</li>
  <li>historic data – between 1968 and 1995 – is available only at country and region level on a quarterly basis</li>
  <li>property status data does not include the most recent two months, as first estimates for new build are based on a small sample which can cause volatility in initial estimates</li>
  <li>volume data does not include the most recent two months because the data is not complete – we aim to report on accurate and reliable information and therefore do not want to release sales volume data that has the potential to be misleading if quoted out of context</li>
  <li>volume data for buyer status is not available</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.7 </span> Differences between the Search the UK House Price Index tool and the data tables</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi" rel="external">Search the UK House Price Index</a> tool allows customers to produce downloadable reports derived from the House Price Index data. The reports can be downloaded in CSV or Turtle formats, and the SPARQL query generated in the background can be viewed. Real-time preview allows search options covering average prices, indices, sales volumes and property types from 1968 to the latest available data to be easily changed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.8 </span> The significance of the beta status</h3>

<p>The beta status allows us to review the service and make changes to the current format. We will collate feedback during the beta period and where appropriate make changes to the search tool.</p>
