<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Executive summary</h2>

<p>First launched in June 2016, the UK House Price Index (<abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>) is a joint production by HM Land Registry, Land and Property Services Northern Ireland, the Office for National Statistics and Registers of Scotland. The <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> has been published initially as an experimental statistic. We have now implemented all the improvements and are seeking designation for the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> as a national statistic.</p>

<p>The construction of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> is complex and brings together a number of comprehensive administrative data sources. The data used in the compilation of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> can be categorised as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Price data from HM Land Registry for England and Wales, Registers of Scotland and HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>); Stamp Duty Land Tax sales for Northern Ireland processed by Land and Property Services Northern Ireland (<abbr title="Land and Property Services Northern Ireland">LPSNI</abbr>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data on the attributes of data sold from the Valuation Office Agency, <abbr title="Land and Property Services Northern Ireland">LPSNI</abbr> Valuation List and Energy Performance Certificates Scotland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demographic characteristics of the area in which the property is located through the Acorn dataset, produced and licensed by CACI.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Incorporating so many different data sources into any statistic, involves a certain degree of risk. Administrative data, in particular, may be collected and compiled by third parties, outside the Code of Practice for official statistics.</p>

<p>To further assure ourselves and users of the quality of our statistics, we have undertaken a thorough quality assessment of these data sources. This assessment is a continuous process, and we will publish updates periodically.</p>

<p>We have followed the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (<abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr>) toolkit, as described by the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR). Using the toolkit, we established the level of assurance we are seeking (or “benchmark”) for each source. The assurance levels are set as either “basic”, “enhanced” or “comprehensive”, depending on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the risk of quality concerns for that source, based on various factors, such as the source’s weight in the headline index, the complexity of the data source, contractual and communication arrangements currently in place, and other important considerations</li>
  <li>the public interest profile of the item which is being measured, and its contribution to the headline index</li>
</ul>

<p>Through engagement with our suppliers, we have assessed the assurance level that we have currently achieved by considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operational context of the data; why and how it is collected</li>
  <li>the communication and agreements in place between ourselves and the supplier the quality assurance procedures undertaken by the supplier</li>
  <li>the quality assurance procedures undertaken by us</li>
</ul>

<p>Table 1 below summarises the quality assurance benchmarks that were set, and the assurance levels that we have assessed each source at during this assessment.</p>

<p>As a result of this assessment, we have put in place an action plan to improve our quality assurance in some areas.</p>

<p>Statisticians in <abbr title="Land and Property Services Northern Ireland">LPSNI</abbr> have since made a significant effort to engage with staff at <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and have increased their understanding of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s own assurance of this data. In March 2018 we published our quality assurance of sales data from Stamp Duty Land Tax returns. The remaining areas we are still working on are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> is looking to standardise their communication and engagement with the Valuation Office Agency given the potential wider use of the Council Tax Valuation List data across the office</li>
  <li>land registration transactions involving the creation of a new register, such as new builds, are more complex and an increase in applications has created a backlog for HM Land Registry. As a result, processing takes longer. Read about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-annual-report-and-accounts-2017-to-2018/performance-report#brilliant-at-the-basics--by-design">what we’ve done to reduce our backlog</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-service-standards/our-service-standards">our service standards</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-business-strategy-2017-to-2022">our future plans</a>

</ul>

<p>We will continue to engage with our data suppliers to better understand any quality concerns that may arise, and to raise their understanding of how their data are used in the construction of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Our assessment of data sources is carried out in accordance with the Office for Statistics Regulation’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/monitoring-and-assessment/monitoring/administrative-data-and-official-statistics/" rel="external">Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (<abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr>) toolkit</a>. We are striving for a proportionate approach to assessing the required level of quality assurance for the many and varied data sources used in the compilation of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>. We seek to highlight and address the shortcomings that we have identified, and reassure users that the quality of the source data is monitored and fit for purpose.</p>

<p>In this paper, we set out the steps we have taken to quality assure our data, and our assessment of each source. In section 3, we outline our approach to assessing our data sources. In section 4, we discuss the assurance levels we are seeking for each data source, and the resulting assessment. Finally, in section 5, we detail our next steps towards achieving full assurance.</p>

<p>This publication is part of an ongoing process of dialogue with our suppliers, to increase our understanding of any quality concerns in the source data, and to raise awareness of how it is utilised. Through this document, we aim to provide information and assurance to users that the sources used to construct the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> is sufficient for the purposes for which it is used. We will, therefore, review this document every 2 years. For more information on our <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> measure please see our guidance document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/about-the-uk-house-price-index/about-the-uk-house-price-index">About the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr></a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Approach to assessment</h2>

<p>We have conducted our assessment of data sources used in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> using the Office for Statistics Regulation’s <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> toolkit. We took the following steps for each data source:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establish the risk of quality concerns with the data</li>
  <li>establish the level of public interest in the item that the data are being used to measure determine benchmark quality assurance levels, based on the risk and public interest</li>
  <li>contact the suppliers of administrative data to understand their own practices and approach to quality assurance; generally, this consists of the following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>send out questions to our data suppliers requesting information on their quality assurance procedures conduct follow up meetings/discussions with our data suppliers to request further information and clarification</li>
      <li>maintain ongoing dialogues with data suppliers to develop a better understanding of any quality issues in the data, and raise awareness of how the source data are used</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>review our own quality assurance and validation procedures and processes</li>
  <li>conduct an assessment of each data source using the four practice areas of the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data toolkit:
    <ul>
      <li>operational context and data collection communication with data suppliers</li>
      <li>quality assurance procedures of the data supplier quality assurance procedures of producer</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>determine an overall quality assurance level based on our assessment</li>
  <li>if this assurance level does not match the benchmark assurance level, then put steps in place to work towards meeting the required assurance level</li>
  <li>review the quality assurance on an ongoing basis; we will publish a <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> update every 2 years</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Setting the benchmarks</h3>

<p>In accordance with the <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> toolkit, we have sought assurance for each data source based on the risk of quality concerns associated with that data source, and the public interest in the particular item being measured by that data source.</p>

<p>We considered a high, medium or low risk of data quality concerns based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importance of the data source in explaining the price of a property (in other words, what would we do if we didn’t have this data.</li>
  <li>the complexity of the data source; for example, whether it is compiled from a number of different sources,</li>
  <li>the existing contractual and communication arrangements currently in place</li>
  <li>other considerations, such as any existing published information on data collection, methodology or quality assurance, or mitigation of high-risk factors with the data</li>
</ul>

<p>We considered a high, medium or low public interest profile based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the level of media or user interest in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr> or its sub-components</li>
  <li>the economic or political importance of the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>any additional scrutiny from commentators, based on particular concerns about the data</li>
</ul>

<p>Together the risk of quality concerns and public interest profile are combined to set an overall assurance level that is required for a particular source. This assessment is based on the following matrix, as provided by UK Statistics Authority (Table 2).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> practice areas</h3>

<p>We have aimed to assess the quality of each data source based on four broad practice areas. These relate to the quality assurance of official statistics and the administrative data used to produce them: our knowledge of the operational context in which the data are recorded, building good communication links with our data suppliers, an understanding of our suppliers’ quality processes and standards, and the quality processes and standards that we apply. This is in line with the Office for Statistics Regulations expectations for quality assurance of data sources. The full assessments for each data source can be found in Annex A. Table 3 provides a breakdown of these practice areas.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Assurance level assessment</h2>

<p>In this section, we provide links which describe each of our data sources, and consider the assurance level that we are seeking (or “benchmark”) for these. Within these links, we also summarise our current assessment of the data and outline any further steps that may be required to reach the benchmark assurance level. We will also use this process to build engagement with our suppliers to better understand the data source, as well as raising awareness of how the data are used in the <abbr title="UK House Price Index">UK HPI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Action plan</h2>

<p>In the previous sections, we have considered quality assurance for all data sources in our house price index.</p>

<p>Of the data sources we investigated, there are some that need further work to reach the level of assurance we are seeking.</p>

<p>To address these shortcomings, we will carry out further steps to improve our quality assurance. All outstanding actions are summarised below (Table 4), with details on what actions we intend to take to rectify them.</p>

<p>This version of the house price index <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> is intended to act as a progress update.</p>

<p>Statisticians in <abbr title="Land and Property Services Northern Ireland">LPSNI</abbr> have made a significant effort to engage with staff at <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>, and have increased their understanding of <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s own assurance of this data. In March 2018 we published our quality assurance of sales data from Stamp Duty Land Tax returns.</p>

<p>We intend to continue engaging with our data suppliers and, where appropriate, put in place firmer ongoing communications mechanisms and data delivery agreements. Importantly, this <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> is not intended to serve as a final record of quality assurance. We view supplier engagement and feedback as an ongoing process, which we will continue to follow. We, therefore, intend to publish a review to this <abbr title="Quality Assurance of Administrative Data">QAAD</abbr> every 2 years.</p>
