<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Border Force has introduced a new way for those travelling to and from the UK on pleasure craft to report their journey.</p>

<p>Anyone who owns, or is responsible for, a pleasure craft that sails to or from the UK is required to provide information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vessel</li>
  <li>the voyage</li>
  <li>individuals on board</li>
  <li>goods on board</li>
</ul>

<p>This was previously done through a downloadable C1331 form.</p>

<p>This has now been replaced with a faster, simpler and editable digital form that can be submitted online.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">Further information on the new service can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>This partner pack provides information and resources for promoting the new and improved service.</p>

<p>You can support our efforts by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Downloading and displaying/distributing our posters and banners</li>
  <li>Using our suggested social media assets and posts</li>
  <li>Promoting the service in communications with your audiences</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why a new service?</h2>

<p>The new pleasure craft report service helps maximise maritime border security while making it faster and easier for those travelling on pleasure craft to report the necessary information in advance of travel to or from the UK.</p>

<p>The previous C1331 form can still be downloaded and posted if required. However, wherever possible, Border Force encourages the use and promotion of the new digital service.</p>

<h2>Key features of the new service</h2>

<h3>Fully digital</h3>

<p>Making it more efficient, agile and environmentally-friendly.</p>

<h3>Fully editable</h3>

<p>Allowing users to amend their information with ease if their travel plans change.</p>

<h3>Quicker</h3>

<p>As creation of an online account saves journey, vessel and passenger information for future use.</p>

<h3>Simpler</h3>

<p>As the new process was developed in collaboration with user insight and testing, with additional information added to support the user.</p>

<h2>Campaign guidelines</h2>

<p>The ‘Submit a pleasure craft report (sPCR)’ campaign was created in response to findings gathered from strategic research, user insight and testing. As a result, the assets provided in this partner pack may be downloaded and distributed, but never edited or altered, as this could cause confusion and undermine the authority of the campaign.</p>

<p>We have provided example posts for social media. However, we understand that you may want to create tailored messaging for your own communications. Please consider the following messaging tips when writing your communications.</p>

<h3>Messaging tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Language should be clear and to the point. Avoid jargon and technical language where possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep sentence length short (less than 25 words).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engage the audience by speaking to them directly, referring to them as ‘you’ rather than ‘someone’ or ‘a person’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ‘entering or leaving’, not ‘immigrating or migrating’, as this could alienate some audiences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ‘pleasure craft reporting’, not ‘e-C1331 reporting’ or ‘sPCR reporting’, as this is clearer for the audience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always include the website URL where users can find further information: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested social media posts</h3>

<p>When writing for social media, keep captions short and to the point. Tell the audience that pleasure craft reporting has changed, and where they can go for more information. See the following examples for inspiration and consult the messaging tips.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> What is a pleasure craft?</h3>

<p>Pleasure craft (also known as pleasure boats) are used for sport and leisure purposes by the owner and/or family and friends of the owner on voyages for which the owner does not receive money. If you carry goods for industrial or commercial purposes, your boat becomes a commercial vessel and you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report*goods*arriving*at*a*uk*port*on*a*commercial*vessel">follow alternative reporting methods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> How do I complete the pleasure craft report using the new digital service?</h3>

<p>You can find instructions on how to fill out and complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">new digital report</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="external">here</a>. Helpful prompts and information are also provided while navigating the service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Do I still need to phone Border Force or National Yachtline?</h3>

<p>No. You only need to call National Yachtline if anything has changed since you submitted your voyage plan and you have not been able to</p>

<p>update this online. If you require immigration clearance to enter the UK (i.e. you do not have a right of permanent residence in the UK) and you have not been granted such clearance since you submitted your report, you must telephone Border Force.</p>

<p>National Yachtline will be able to tell you how to do this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> When do Ineed to submit my pleasure craft report?</h3>

<p>You should submit your report in advance, within 24 hours and up to 2 hours before departure to or from the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Does everyone onboard my boat need to submit a pleasure craft report?</h3>

<p>No. You only need to submit one report per pleasure craft, per voyage. This should include the details of everyone onboard.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Do I need to submit a separate form for my return journey?</h3>

<p>Yes. You must submit a report for each leg of your voyage.</p>

<p>You can generate and save a draft report in advance, following submission of your first leg report. Ensure that any changes to persons or goods on board are noted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Can I amend a report I have already submitted?</h3>

<p>Yes. The amended report will replace the previous and a new reference will be generated.</p>

<p>If you are unable to do this (for example, due to lack of internet access) you should telephone National Yachtline on 0300 123 2012 at the first opportunity to advise them of the change. If travel is no longer taking place, the report can be cancelled.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Who will my details be shared with?</h3>

<p>Your details will be used by Border Force and HMRC for the purposes of immigration and customs control. We may share this information with other law enforcement bodies or other government agencies in line with GDPR rules. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.spcr.homeoffice.gov.uk/privacy*and*cookie*policy" rel="external">More information can be found here</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9. </span> If I submit a report to Border Force, do I need to submit a separate report to HMRC?</h3>

<p>No. The new digital pleasure craft report is a one*</p>

<p>stop service recording all necessary information for both Border Force and HMRC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10. </span> I am unable to access the digital service to submit a report, what should I do?</h3>

<p>If you are unable to access the digital service due, for example, to a lack of internet, you should telephone National Yachtline on 0300 123 2012.</p>
