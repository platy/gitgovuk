<h2>General disclaimer on the Synthesised text document</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>This document presents the synthesised text for the application, in respect of relations between the United Kingdom and Chile, of the Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with respect to Taxes on Income signed on 12 July 2003 (the ‘Convention’), as modified by the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting signed by the United Kingdom and Chile on 7 June 2017 (the ‘MLI’).</p>

<p>This document was prepared in consultation with the competent authority of Chile and represents a shared understanding of the modifications made to the Convention by the Multilateral Instrument (MLI).</p>

<p>The document was prepared on the basis of the MLI position of the United Kingdom submitted to the Depositary upon ratification on 29 June 2018 and of the MLI position of Chile submitted to the Depositary upon ratification on 26 November 2020. These MLI positions are subject to modifications as provided in the MLI. Modifications made to MLI positions could modify the effects of the MLI on the Convention.</p>

<p>The authentic legal texts of the Convention and the MLI take precedence and remain the legal texts applicable.</p>

<p>The provisions of the MLI that are applicable with respect to the provisions of the Convention are included in boxes throughout the text of this document in the context of the relevant provisions of the Convention. The boxes containing the provisions of the MLI have generally been inserted in accordance with the ordering of the provisions of the 2017 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Tax Convention.</p>

<p>Changes to the text of the provisions of the MLI have been made to conform the terminology used in the MLI to the terminology used in the Convention (such as ‘Covered Tax Agreement’ and ‘Convention’, ‘Contracting Jurisdictions’ and ‘Contracting States’), to ease the comprehension of the provisions of the MLI. The changes in terminology are intended to increase the readability of the document and are not intended to change the substance of the provisions of the MLI. Similarly, changes have been made to parts of provisions of the MLI that describe existing provisions of the Convention: descriptive language has been replaced by legal references of the existing provisions to ease the readability.</p>

<p>In all cases, references made to the provisions of the Convention or to the Convention must be understood as referring to the Convention as modified by the provisions of the MLI, provided such provisions of the MLI have taken effect.</p>

<p>The provisions of the MLI applicable to this Convention do not take effect on the same dates as the original provisions of the Convention. Each of provisions of the MLI could take effect on different dates, depending on the types of taxes involved (taxes withheld at source or other taxes levied) and on the choices made by the United Kingdom and Chile in their MLI positions.</p>

  <li>26 November 2020 for Chile</li>

<p>Entry into force of the MLI:</p>

</li>
  <li>Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.<br><br>

<p>and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p>

<p>2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of tax charged therein on those profits.

4. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<br><br>
5. Where a company that is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.<br><br>

<ol>
  <li>Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<br><br>

  <li>However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed</li>
</ol>

<p>a) 5 per cent on the gross amount of the interest derived from:<br><br>
(i) loans granted by banks and insurance companies;<br><br>

3. The term ‘interest’ as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. The term interest shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10 of this Convention.<br><br>
4. The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<br><br>
5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<br><br>
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<br><br>
7.

<ol>
  <li>Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.<br><br>
</li>
  <li>However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:</li>
</ol>

<p>a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment;<br><br>

In such case the provisions of Article 7 of this Convention shall apply.<br><br>
5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.<br><br>
6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount that would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.<br><br>

<h2>Exchange of notes</h2>

<p>Your Excellency<br>
London<br>
12th July 2003</p>

<p>I have the honour to refer to the Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains which has been signed today and to make on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Chile the following proposals:</p>

<h3>In general</h3>

<p>It is understood that the two Governments shall, through the competent authorities, consult together regarding the terms, operation and application of the Convention to ensure that it continues to serve the purposes of avoiding double taxation and preventing fiscal evasion and shall, where they consider it appropriate, conclude Protocols to amend the Convention.</p>

<p>Either Government may at any time request consultations, to be conducted by the competent authorities in an expeditious manner on matters relating to the terms, operation and application of the Convention which it considers require urgent resolution.</p>

<p>It is agreed that if, after the date on which the Convention enters into force, either Contracting State introduces a tax on capital under its domestic law, the Contracting States will enter into negotiations with a view to concluding a Protocol to amend the Convention by extending its scope to include any tax on capital so introduced.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (3) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</h4>

<p>For the purposes of preventing misuse of Articles 5 and 7, in determining the duration of activities under this paragraph, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise (other than enterprises of that Contracting State) may be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (7) of Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)</h4>

<p>It is understood that where the commercial or financial conditions made or imposed between the broker or agent and the enterprise differ from those which would be made between independent persons, such broker or agent will not be considered an agent of independent status within the meaning of paragraph (7) of Article 5.</p>

<h4>With reference to Article 7 (Business Profits)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the provisions of paragraph (3) of the Article shall apply only if the expenses can be attributed to the permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of the tax legislation of the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 9 are not to be construed as requiring a Contracting State to make any adjustment to the amount of profits charged to tax in that State unless it is satisfied that the action taken by the other Contracting State under paragraph (1) of the Article is justified both in principle and as regards the amount of any adjustment to profits made by that other State.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 10 (Dividends)</h4>

<p>It is agreed that, in relation to the application of the additional tax under the laws of Chile, should:</p>

<p>(i) the first category tax cease to be fully creditable in computing the amount of additional tax to be paid; or<br><br>
(ii) the rate of additional tax imposed with respect to residents of the United Kingdom, as determined under the provisions of Article 4 of this Convention exceed 42 per cent<br><br>
the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to amending the Convention to re-establish the balance of benefits under the Convention.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 11 (Interest) and paragraph (2) of Article 12 (Royalties)</h4>

<p>It is agreed that if any agreement or convention between Chile and a member state of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development entering into force after the date of entry into force of the Convention provides that Chile shall exempt from tax interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of specific categories of interest or royalties) arising in Chile, or limit the tax charged in Chile on such interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of specific categories of interest or royalties) to a rate lower than that provided for in paragraph (2) of Article 11 or paragraph (2) of Article 12 of the Convention, such exemption or lower rate shall automatically apply to interest or royalties (either generally or in respect of those specific categories of interest or royalties) arising in Chile and beneficially owned by a resident of the United Kingdom and interest or royalties arising in the United Kingdom and beneficially owned by a resident of Chile under the same conditions as if such exemption or lower rate had been specified in those paragraphs. The competent authority of Chile shall inform the competent authority of the United Kingdom without delay that the conditions for the application of this paragraph have been met.</p>

<h4>With reference to Article 12 (Royalties)</h4>

<p>If the rights acquired in relation to the copyright of a non-customised software program (so-called ‘shrink-wrapped’ software) are limited to those necessary to enable the user to operate the program, the payment received in connection with the transfer of those rights, shall be treated as business profits subject to Article 7.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 14 (Income from Employment) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 18 (Government Service)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the expression ‘salaries, wages and other similar remuneration’ shall be interpreted to mean all types of remuneration derived by the resident, including benefits in kind received in respect of the employment.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 17 (Pensions, Maintenance Payments and Pension Contributions)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the term ‘pensions’ includes any payments made to a scheme member or beneficiary in accordance with the scheme’s rules by a pension scheme that is recognised for tax purposes by the Contracting State in which the pension arises.</p>

<p>If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom, I have the honour to suggest that the present Note and Your Excellency’s reply to that effect should be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments in this matter, which shall enter into force at the same time as the entry into force of the Convention.</p>

<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>

<p>Your Excellency <br>
London<br>
12th July 2003</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 10 (Dividends)</h4>

<p>It is agreed that, in relation to the application of the additional tax under the laws of Chile, should:</p>

the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to amending the Convention to re-establish the balance of benefits under the Convention.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (2) of Article 11 (Interest) and paragraph (2) of Article 12 (Royalties)</h4>

The competent authority of Chile shall inform the competent authority of the United Kingdom without delay that the conditions for the application of this paragraph have been met.</p>

<h4>With reference to Article 12 (Royalties)</h4>

<p>If the rights acquired in relation to the copyright of a non-customised software program (so-called ‘shrink-wrapped’ software) are limited to those necessary to enable the user to operate the program, the payment received in connection with the transfer of those rights, shall be treated as business profits subject to Article 7.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 14 (Income from Employment) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 18 (Government Service)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the expression ‘salaries, wages and other similar remuneration’ shall be interpreted to mean all types of remuneration derived by the resident, including benefits in kind received in respect of the employment.</p>

<h4>With reference to paragraph (1) of Article 17 (Pensions, Maintenance Payments and Pension Contributions)</h4>

<p>It is understood that the term ‘pensions’ includes any payments made to a scheme member or beneficiary in accordance with the scheme’s rules by a pension scheme that is recognised for tax purposes by the Contracting State in which the pension arises.</p>

<p>If the foregoing proposals are acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom, I have the honour to suggest that the present Note and Your Excellency’s reply to that effect should be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments in this matter, which shall enter into force at the same time as the entry into force of the Convention.</p>

<p>The foregoing proposals being acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom, I have the honour to confirm that Your Excellency’s Note and this reply shall be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments in this matter which shall enter into force at the same time as the entry into force of the Convention.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.</p>
