<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Schools, further education providers and local authorities have supported children and young people to access the internet by providing connectivity solutions. This has been through several means, including schools and other settings distributing 4G routers and organising mobile data uplifts, provided by the Department for Education (DfE). Schools and other settings have been purchasing their own connectivity solutions since September 2021.</p>

<p>Schools and other settings can apply for funding to contribute towards the costs they have incurred to support children and young people to access the internet when face-to-face education is disrupted due to coronavirus (COVID-19). It covers costs incurred between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Expiry or review date</h3>

<p>This guidance will be kept under regular review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Scope</h2>

<p>These grant conditions relate to the allocation schools and other settings may receive to support the costs associated with supporting children and young people to gain internet access.</p>

<p>Eligible settings can claim for connectivity support they have purchased between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022 for children and young people who do not otherwise have access to adequate internet connectivity at home when coronavirus (COVID-19) related disruption to face to face education has taken place. This must have also been reported to DfE where appropriate (for example, via the education setting status form (ESSF)).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Eligibility</h2>

<p>The following institution types will be eligible for this funding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>16 to 19 academies and maintained schools</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies, including hospital schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>special academies and special maintained schools</li>
  <li>further education colleges and sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
  <li>independent training providers (where student places are funded by ESFA)</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions with publicly funded students over the age of 19 with an education, health and care plan (EHC) plan who also received free meals are also eligible.</p>

<p>As set out above, independent institutions (with fee-paying pupils and students) are not eligible for this funding.</p>

<p>At eligible institutions, all pupils in years 3 to 13 are in scope as are any pupils aged 19 plus currently attending college during this period.</p>

<p>We are providing this funding to support schools and colleges to meet the cost of providing connectivity to children and young people.</p>

<p>Institutions will have discretion over what connectivity support they purchase.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Purpose and permitted use of connectivity funding</h2>

<p>Connectivity funding must be used to provide connectivity support to children and young people who do not otherwise have access to suitable internet connectivity at home in order to access remote education when face-to-face education is disrupted due to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>To claim the connectivity grant, schools must meet the following conditions:</p>

<h4>General requirements</h4>

<ol>
  <li>The setting must be experiencing disruption between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022, and have reported it to DfE where appropriate (for example, via the ESSF).</li>
  <li>The setting must have confirmed with the child or young personâs parent or guardian that they are not able to afford their own connectivity solution, including consideration of affordable/social tariffs suitable for supporting digital remote education.</li>
  <li>The setting must purchase connectivity solutions between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022, which are made available to pupils in need.</li>
  <li>Invoices relevant to the connectivity costs must be paid by the school, college or local authority and payment must not be delayed solely in the expectation of the grant claim being approved.</li>
  <li>If a claim is approved, schools, colleges and local authorities agree to respond to requests from DfE to evaluate the use and impact of the grant to meet the purpose set out above.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Value for money</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Schools must seek to achieve best value for money when purchasing connectivity solutions, using their own knowledge or guidance provided by DfE.</li>
  <li>Schools, colleges and local authorities must source connectivity solutions in line with relevant requirements and guidance for their institution type regarding financial governance and procurement good practise.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Required record keeping</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Schools, colleges and local authorities must keep receipt records of connectivity solutions purchased between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022.</li>
  <li>These must be kept available for attaching to the grant claim and for any inspection, either as part of a spot check on connectivity expenditure or as part of an audit.</li>
  <li>Schools, colleges and local authorities must provide information, as may be required by the Secretary of State, to determine whether they have complied with these conditions.</li>
</ol>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The amount claimed must be inclusive of any applicable VAT, unless relief is available elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Allocations</h2>

<p>While there is no set limit for the amount that can be claimed, we expect the claims to be related to connectivity support needed by disadvantaged pupils and students, which we expect will correspond with the number of pupils or students eligible for, as applicable, free school meals or free meals, as indicated on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/">get information about schools</a> and other data available to DfE. If a setting does not have this information, it is expected to correspond with estimated data or using free meals eligibility data.</p>

<p>As a guide, we expect claims to be up to Â£75 per pupil or student claimed for, although costs higher than this may be approved where reasonable supporting information is provided.</p>

<p>We may review claims against data available to DfE about disruption affecting the institution to which the claim relates. We may also limit the claim amount or reject the entire claim where reported disruption does not at least meet the reported level of disruption.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Payments</h2>

<p>A one-off payment will be made to schools and colleges, with payments being made retrospectively and based on information reported through the grants platform.</p>

<p>For connectivity purchased in the period from 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022, we anticipate making payments at the end of March 2022 to eligible settings. We may be in touch regarding any claims where further information or clarification is required.</p>

<p>We have asked institutions to purchase necessary connectivity solutions so that disadvantaged children and young people without access to the internet at home, who experience disruption to their face-to-face education, can access remote learning.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Variation</h2>

<p>These conditions of grant may be altered at any time. Participating institutions will be notified of this through existing channels.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Recovery of funding</h2>

<p>This funding is being provided under section 14 of the Education Act 2002, section 14 of the Education Act 2002 and section 100(1) of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 and we reserve the right to audit the expenditure. We will seek to recover funding that has been paid in error.</p>

<p>This includes overpayment where an institution has claimed for more than their receipted costs.</p>

<p>Recoveries will be made by invoice or by offsetting the amount against subsequent payments due from DfE.</p>

<p>The recipient must notify DfE immediately through the ESFA enquiry form where it becomes aware of any instance of error, suspected fraud or financial irregularity in the use of the funds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Monitoring, assurance and data requirements</h2>

<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that public funds are properly managed in line with these grant conditions.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to request assurance of this grant funding and will provide further details as necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Further information</h2>

<p>Books, other documents and records relating to the recipientâs accounts shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, under section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>Schools, colleges, and local authorities shall provide information as may be required by the Secretary of State to determine whether it has complied with these conditions.</p>
