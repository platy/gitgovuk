<p>After answering all questions, you will be prompted to complete your declarations. When you have completed the declarations, you will be able to submit your form. Once your form submission is confirmed, an explanation on what happens next will follow.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Selecting âcontinueâ on each page will take you through the form.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Introduction Page</h3>
<p>This page gives you an overview of Get Help with Technology claim form and confirms the claim deadline.</p>

<p>The data collected in this form will be matched with census, educational setting status form (ESSF) and Get Help with Technology data, to track claims and to monitor delivery of these funds.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Your details</h3>
<p>This is a read-only page that confirms your details, including your setting, when signing in to your DfE Sign-in account.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Connectivity grant</h3>
<p>Subject to verification, schools and other settings can apply for funding to contribute towards the costs they have incurred to support children and young people to access the internet when face-to-face education is disrupted due to coronavirus (COVID-19).  It covers costs incurred between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should only include VAT in this cost if your setting is unable to reclaim the amount of VAT elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>Technical support</h3>

<h4>Devices reset grant</h4>
<p>Schools and other settings can apply for grants to contribute towards the technical support costs incurred in resetting devices received from DfE.</p>

<p>Schools and other settings can claim for costs incurred for purchasing technical support during the period 1 November 2021 to 14 January 2022 relating to resetting a DfE restricted device received in academic year 2019 to 2020 or academic year 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>This grant is intended to support organisations that may not currently have the capacity to reset devices they received from Get Help with Technology. Restrictions and eligibility criteria are set out in the guidance.  Restrictions include the types of devices received, types of technical support used and limitations on the maximum amounts that can be claimed.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should only include VAT in this cost if your setting is unable to reclaim the amount of VAT elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<h4>Setting up new devices grant</h4>
<p>Schools and other settings can also claim for costs incurred for purchasing technical support during the period 1 November 2021 to 14 January 2022 relating to setting up a device received from the DfE on or after 1 November 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>Value for money</h3>

<p>We expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools seek to achieve best value for money when purchasing connectivity solutions and sourcing technical support provision, using their own knowledge or guidance provided by DfE</li>
  <li>schools, colleges and local authorities to source connectivity and technical support provision in line with relevant requirements and guidance for their institution type regarding financial governance and procurement good practise</li>
  <li>schools, colleges and local authorities to ensure that the technical support provider used is appropriately qualified (for example, through Microsoft certification or other relevant industry accreditation) to carry out the work necessary to set up devices to be used safely</li>
  <li>technical support costs claimed for must only relate to the use of an appropriately qualified professional service which the school is charged for (whether as an external commercial provider or internal costed service)</li>
  <li>costs cannot be claimed where the support provider is not professionally qualified and/or is providing support on a free/voluntary basis and/or where there would not normally be a cost incurred by the school, college or local authority for their support</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should only include VAT in this cost if your setting is unable to reclaim the amount of VAT elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Supportive evidence</h3>
<p>Schools, colleges and local authorities must keep receipt records of connectivity solutions purchased between 1 September 2021 to 27 February 2022 and receipt records of technical support costs relating to eligible devices that incurred between 1 November 2021 to 14 January 2022.</p>

<p>These must be kept available for attaching to the grant claim and for any inspection, either as part of a spot check on connectivity expenditure or as part of an audit.</p>

<p>Schools, colleges and local authorities must provide information, as may be required by the Secretary of State, to determine whether they have complied with these conditions.</p>

<p>You can upload up to 5 files to support your claim, but each file size must not exceed 10MB.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must upload at least one file to continue.</p>
