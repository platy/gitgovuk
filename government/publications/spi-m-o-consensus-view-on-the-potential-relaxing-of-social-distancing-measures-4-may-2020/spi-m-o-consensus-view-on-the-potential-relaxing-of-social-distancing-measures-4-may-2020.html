<p><strong>Note added for publication</strong></p>

<p>This paper contains estimates of R for some regions of the UK. Please note that these are estimates from individual modelling groups, and not agreed consensus estimates from SAGE. The estimates cited in this paper are for specified scenarios, and are not forecasts.</p>

<p>R is an average value that can vary in different parts of the country, communities, and subsections of the population. It cannot be measured directly so there is always some uncertainty around its exact value. Regional estimates are subject to greater uncertainty given the lower number of cases and increased variation.</p>
</div>

<p>1. 4 modelling groups (Bristol, Imperial, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [<abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>], and Warwick) studied the impact of potential future changes to social distancing measures as follows. The changes in in the below table were based on the safer workplaces workstream.</p>

<p>These phases were run under 2 scenarios of either a maximum of 15 contacts per index case or a maximum of 30 contacts per index case, both with highly effective contact tracing which could reach 80% of contacts within 48 hours.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Note that modelled changes in contact patterns may not reflect the final policies under consideration.</strong> The list of policies was not finalised in time for <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr> to be commissioned to model them directly. However, assumptions and approximations will always need to be made when translating the real world into models, and it will never be possible to provide a direct read across. Insights can be drawn from modelling to inform a range of policy scenarios as they develop.</p>

<p>3. The different modelling groups have different assumptions about the current overall reproduction number in the UK, reflecting true uncertainty. Whilst the groups all thought that <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> in the UK overall was less than one, <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>’s modelled estimates were of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> currently being about one in some regions of England, particularly the East of England, and the North East and Yorkshire. Estimation of current <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> is complicated by the presence of interacting epidemics in the community, hospitals, and care homes. <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>’s figure may be an overestimate of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> in the community due to the impact of transmission in hospitals on their overall estimates of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Phase 1</h2>

<p>1. All groups found that changes in line with phase one would make only a modest impact on the current reproduction number, so <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> remains below one and incidence continues to fall in most areas, although with some regional variation.</p>

<h2>Phase 2</h2>

<p>2. There were differences in findings for scenario 2, with results depending on the assumptions made around susceptibly of children to infection and the role in transmission of people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.</p>

<p>3. There was consensus that high quality contact tracing would be needed during this phase in order to keep <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> below one.</p>

<p>4. Bristol, Warwick and <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>’s results had little variation between schools re-opening for primary school children and those from transition years. Imperial’s results suggested that the latter would result in a larger increase in <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>, primarily due to there being a greater proportion of parents able to return to work.</p>

<p>5. Bristol and Warwick found that, with effective contact tracing, either scenario would be consistent with maintaining <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> less than one. <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr> found that even with effective contact tracing, in either scenario <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> would be equal to or greater than one in some regions. In those regions, incidence does not fall. Imperial found that scenario one would allow <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> to remain below one, but scenario 2 would not, although incidence would only slowly increase.</p>

<h2>Phases 3 and 4</h2>

<p>6. Phases 3 and 4 have not been discussed in detail by <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling">SPI-M</abbr>, however most models showed in a rapid exponential increase in numbers of cases in phase 4.</p>

<p>4 graphs of daily deaths in hospitals from 1 March to 1 October 2020. Graphs present data from different modelling groups: Warwick; Bristol, Imperial and <abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>. Each has two plotted trajectories: a dark and light blue line.</p>

<h2>General conclusions</h2>

<p>7. High levels of health care acquired infections and cases in care homes makes it very difficult to accurately estimate the current value of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> due to community transmission, and therefore the impact of future policy changes on the trajectory of the epidemic.</p>

<p>8. Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below one. Such changes cannot be forecast and therefore have not been included in these models. Even with contact tracing in place, there will need to be sustained, deep reductions in contacts outside work and schools to keep the reproduction number below one.</p>

<p>9. The changes in phase one are likely to allow <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> to remain below one, if adherence rates do not drop. Any changes in adherence rates or behavioural changes could have a much larger impact than specific policies. For example, <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> would increase if more children going to school resulted in more workplace contacts for their parents.</p>

<p>10. Assumptions made about the cases currently taking place in hospital settings and care homes has a big impact on any conclusions that can be drawn on the changes made in phase 2.</p>

<p>11. Very effective contact tracing is essential for any changes that take place after phase 2.</p>

<p>12. There is regional variation in both current incidence and current reproduction numbers which will need to be monitored very closely. There will also be more localised variation, which could cause localised outbreaks, even if the reproduction number remains below one overall nationally.</p>

<p>13. Some potential policy changes, such as permitting more outdoor activities that maintain social distancing (such as sitting outside alone or as a household), will have a negligible impact on <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>. People working in businesses involving close, sustained contact with many people, however, could have levels of infection as high as those seen in social care, as well as increasing transmission in the community. Such businesses could include hairdressers, nail bars, and other personal care services.</p>
