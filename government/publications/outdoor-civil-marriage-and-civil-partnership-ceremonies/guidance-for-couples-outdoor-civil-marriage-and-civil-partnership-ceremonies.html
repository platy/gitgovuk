<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>Q.1: Can I get married or register a civil partnership outdoors at all types of venue?</h3>

<p>No. This applies to civil marriages or civil partnerships which take place on Approved Premises, such as hotels, where they can be held in the outdoor grounds of the premises, providing that the venue agrees to conduct outdoor ceremonies and can comply with various conditions. Religious premises which are already approved for civil partnership registration will be able to hold the civil partnership ceremony within the grounds of the premises if they wish to offer this option.  In either case you will need to discuss what is possible with the venue.</p>

<p>Civil marriages which are held at a register office and religious marriages conducted in a place of worship cannot currently be held outdoors.</p>

<h3>Q.2: I’m considering having an outdoor ceremony at an Approved Premises venue but I’m not sure which venues offer this option. Is there a register or list which shows which venues in my area will be providing outdoor ceremonies?</h3>

<p>No. However, there is a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-marriages-and-partnerships-approved-premises-list">Approved Premises</a> and you can make enquiries of individual venues in the same way you would in order to determine whether other facilities may be available.</p>

<h3>Q.3: I have an existing ceremony booked at an Approved Premises. Can I now have that ceremony outdoors?</h3>

<p>You should discuss this with the venue as soon as possible. The law allows  ceremonies to take place outdoors in the grounds of the venue. However, whether you can change your ceremony from an approved room at the</p>

<p>Approved Premises to a location in the grounds depends on whether the venue is offering outdoor ceremonies. The venue must also first obtain prior confirmation from the local authority that the proposed location for your outdoor ceremony is seemly and dignified. It is important that you discuss your wishes with the venue before making any firm plans.</p>

<h3>Q.4: Will I need to change my notice of intention to marry or form a civil partnership if I have my ceremony in the grounds of the Approved Premises?</h3>

<p>No. This will not be necessary unless you are changing to a different venue (for example, if your current venue has decided not to offer outdoor ceremonies).</p>

<h3>Q.5: Will my ceremony be cancelled in the event of inclement weather?</h3>

<p>Venues have been advised to consider contingency plans so that a ceremony can still take place on the day.  You should discuss and agree this in advance with the Approved Premises.  This may be use of an approved room within the premises, or a covered structure in the grounds.</p>

<h3>Q.6: Can I have an unlimited number of guests at my ceremony if it is to be held outdoors?</h3>

<p>The maximum number of guests who can attend your ceremony will depend on a number of factors, including, health and safety and fire precautions (including in relation to any structure within which the outdoor ceremony will take place), and any planning restrictions which may be in place or which may be imposed by the local authority on the venue.</p>

<p>Approved Premises will also need to consider how the guests can be accommodated  in the event of inclement weather, whilst meeting health and safety requirements, which may differ, for example, if the ceremony needs to move to an approved room inside the premises.</p>
