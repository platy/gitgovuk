<h2>Remote Monitoring of Sensitive Sites Clarifications</h2>

<h3>Process related</h3>

<h4>Q: Can I submit more than one proposal?</h4>

<p>A: Yes. Multiple submissions are possible. Each should be self contained and have no dependence upon another being successful. Each proposal must meet the funding limit requirement.</p>

<h4>Q: Can the proposal cover more than one Challenge area?</h4>

<p>A: If you’ve read the competition document and think your technology can add value to more than one challenge area you can then you can bid for multiple challenges. Your proposal doesn’t have to cover all 3. However, if you have 2 separate innovations, then you need to do 2 separate proposals.</p>

<h4>Q: Can the project be less than 9 months in duration?</h4>

<p>A: As long as you can demonstrate what you plan to deliver during the contract and it is considered value for money, there is no limitation up to 9 months.</p>

<h4>Q: Our technology is quite expensive to develop. Is £75k a hard limit?</h4>

<p>A: Yes. For this phase, £75k per submission (pre VAT) is a hard limit. More funding may be available in subsequent phases.</p>

<h4>Q: Can the project meetings with Technical Partners (TP) be virtual to reduce travel costs?</h4>

<p>A: Yes, TP meetings can be virtual. Suppliers are expected to attend in person at the NDA event to demonstrate their project. This event will be held in the UK and expected to be in June 2023.</p>

<h4>Q: Can the cost of travel to the demonstration event be covered in the proposal?</h4>

<p>A: Yes</p>

<h4>Q: Is there any limitation on the purchasing of equipment?</h4>

<p>A: You need to explain in your proposal why you would need it to deliver the project. Be aware that any equipment will not belong to you at the end of the process.</p>

<h4>Q: I have never worked with DASA before. Will that be a disadvantage?</h4>

<p>A: No. Previous involvement in DASA competitions does not provide any advantage.</p>

<h4>Q: Who owns hardware/software procured under the funding?</h4>

<p>A: Technically, any non-consumable hardware or software licensed purchased with MOD funds would become MOD property as soon as it is purchased and loaned to the contractor for the purposes of conducting the contract. The contract focuses on the purchase of any high value items (greater than £10K), which will need to be registered as Government Furnished Equipment.</p>

<h4>Q: Will equipment purchased over £10k be taken back?</h4>

<p>A: The MOD would not necessarily take back equipment purchased unless there is a compelling need to do so (e.g. the equipment is needed to support another project). However, the equipment will be registered as a Government Asset and described as such in any future proposal where it is being used.</p>

<h4>Q: Can we work with a partner organisation based in the United States?</h4>

<p>A: Yes, overseas companies are not excluded from DASA competitions. Be aware that the clearance process may take a little longer.</p>

<h3>Technical Clarifications</h3>

<h4>Q: Is my technology within scope?</h4>

<p>A: We are not making any restrictions on technology used. We are not experts and are interested in seeing how any technologies can provide benefits to us. Whatever technology is used, yes, we’re interested. Explain in your proposal how you will use the technology to meet the problems expressed in the Competition Document.</p>

<h4>Q: What Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capability exists in NDA? Are you already using other systems?</h4>

<p>A: We have a GIS project up and running to provide that capability. We would be interested in the ability to look at individual sites and across all. Ways to produce overlays of data for site managers and different display capabilities are of interest.</p>

<p>We use various tools across NDA group, e.g. LIDAR. Our digital roadmap is looking at common capability. 
GIS software used is mentioned in the competition document.</p>

<h4>Q: Do you want moonshot ideas or innovations that can be delivered in the near future?</h4>

<p>A: Both. We want to adapt so moonshot ideas are helpful. Our sites are at different levels of capabilities. Impress upon us what you could do, and where it’s heading on data capture and utilisation.</p>

<h4>Q: Can you provide sample imagery for development?</h4>

<p>A: We are not planning to provide data in Phase 1. Our sites are industrial sites in remote locations. So using an industrial site imagery set would be good to demonstrate your technology - anything that can read across.</p>

<h4>Q: What sensors/systems are in place at the moment?</h4>

<p>A: It’s a moving picture. We are currently in a significant digital transformation from legacy systems to modern digital. Where we are now will be outdated soon.</p>

<h4>Q: What data do you have currently?</h4>

<p>A. We have very few automated systems currently. Some temperature and vibration systems as proof of concept to help with condition monitoring. Collecting and using data is currently very manual.</p>

<h4>Q: What aspects of natural capital are NDA being asked to record / report upon?</h4>

<p>A: There is no specific requirement currently for NDA to record / report upon natural capital, although the government’s direction very much supports a move towards developing and utilising a better understanding of natural capital. However, the NDA strategy lists a number of stainability challenges for the NDA, including decarbonisation of the estate, supporting UK commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to carbon net zero and enhancing biodiversity and delivering environmental net gain.</p>

<p>In recognition of these challenges, the NDA has set itself a goal to better understand the natural capital assets associated with the land it owns and develop a plan to protect and enhance them. Natural Capital is defined in Defra’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/enabling-a-natural-capital-approach-enca">Enabling a Natural Capital approach (ENCA)</a> as the stock of natural assets which provide tangible benefits, which are typically marketed (e.g. timber, fish stocks or minerals), and less tangible services (such as air purification, recreational settings or flood prevention).</p>

<p>The NDA’s approach to natural capital is to develop our understanding informed by the ENCA approach. We are adopting this approach as closely as we can as we develop our baseline understanding and develop our improvement plans, however, we are adapting the process as necessary to fit our situation and land holdings.</p>

<p>Therefore, the ENCA guidance is a suitable place to gain a broader understanding of the aspects of natural capital we are interested in. For instance, with reference to the ENCA assets database. So, for example, we are interested in understanding the range of habitats and natural features on (and close to) our land holdings (e.g. woodlands, farming land, grassland, bogs, freshwaters, sediments, urban etc.), along with its condition where applicable and scale, such that we can quantify and understand ecosystem services that land may provide (e.g. timber, recreation, crops, carbon sequestration, pollination, biodiversity, flood prevention etc.). We will also be interested in change over time such that we can assess improvements, protection of those ecosystem services or where degradation may be occurring.</p>

<h4>Q: What are the regulations on flying drones on the sites?</h4>

<p>A: Generally all sites use drones and each site has its own regulations. Any drone operation would need to comply with individual site rules. 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations need to be followed, depending on the type of drone. 
It is not the intention to disqualify any particular drones. NDA will assess the benefits of use and implement appropriate mitigations to allow use.</p>

<h4>Q: Are you interested in solutions that look beyond the perimeter fence?</h4>

<p>A: An early indication of something coming towards a site is useful. We also do moves by road and rail.</p>
