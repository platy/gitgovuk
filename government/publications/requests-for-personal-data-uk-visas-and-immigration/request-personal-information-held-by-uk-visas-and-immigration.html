<p>You can request personal information about you that is held on the Home Office’s immigration records (this is also known as a ‘subject access request’).</p>

<p>Processing these requests is expensive for the UK taxpayer. Because of this, and so we can give you the best service, you should be as clear as you can about the information you need.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We are not able to provide immigration status documents.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-immigration-status">Check someone’s immigration status</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-work">Check someone’s right to work</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/view-right-to-rent">Check someone’s right to rent</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Types of request</h2>

<p>There are 3 types of request you can make. All types of request are free of charge. If multiple requests are made for the same person, the first request received will be treated as your sole application.</p>

<p>You will receive a response within 1 month of your supporting documents being received by the Home Office. These documents must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#evi-gui">evidence guidance</a> below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please be aware the Subject Access Request Unit are assisting with high priority activities supporting UK national commitments. This has meant that the processing of some data subject requests has been delayed. We appreciate your understanding at this time.</p>

<p>If, after you’ve received <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/requests-for-personal-data-uk-visas-and-immigration/request-personal-information-held-by-uk-visas-and-immigration#detailed">a detailed response from the Home Office</a>, you still need to make a request for personal data held on paper records you should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk">subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. We’ll respond to your request as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Please email us if you no longer require the additional paper records, or if your contact information changes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Basic</h3>

<p>You can request a copy of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an electronic summary of your immigration history</li>
  <li>landing cards we hold electronically</li>
  <li>visa applications you submitted from outside of the UK (as part of entry clearance)</li>
  <li>Workers Registration Scheme (WRS) information if you are a national of Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia</li>
  <li>Entry and exit into and out of the UK. Your travel history can be provided for the past 5 years if a passport or travel document is submitted for this period</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people find that this option gives them all the information they need.</p>

<h3>Specific</h3>

<p>You can request specific information if you need to. You should clearly describe what documents you need.</p>

<p>You can request copies of up to 5 single documents, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a list of your applications</li>
  <li>a particular decision letter</li>
  <li>the outcome of an appeal (appeal determination)</li>
  <li>a particular detention progress report</li>
  <li>a deportation order</li>
  <li>a particular interview record</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need more information than the single documents in this list, you will need to make a detailed request.</p>

<h3>Detailed</h3>

<p>This allows you to request a copy of your Home Office paper file.</p>

<p>Initially, you will be sent an electronic summary of your immigration information (as with a basic application) this gives most people what they need.</p>

<p>However, this option also allows you to request further information from your Home Office paper file if the electronic data did not fulfil your request.</p>

<p>Refining your request to state clearly what paper records you need will help your application.</p>

<h2>How to make a request</h2>

<h3>Apply online</h3>

<p>Using the online application will reduce the time it takes to respond to your request.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/saru" rel="external">online application form</a> to request access to personal information held by UKVI</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Note: This is not a mandatory form – Data Subjects may make a request to access their personal data in other formats which will also be accepted by the Home Office, but this form is designed to speed up the process.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>You can also contact us by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk">subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a query about making a subject access request</li>
  <li>have a query about a subject access request you have made or received</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evidence to send</h3>

<p>Protecting your information is important to us. For this reason, we need to be sure that the person requesting it has permission to do so.</p>

<p>In addition to the questions about you in the application form, we also need the following evidence to confirm your identity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your photo identification, such as a passport</li>
  <li>a letter to give permission for your records to be sent to you, or your representative</li>
  <li>proof of your relationship, if you are applying for a child under 12</li>
</ul>

<p>You should have this evidence ready before you start your application.</p>

<p>You will be advised where to email your evidence in your application form. Your application will not be accepted until we receive these documents, and it will be automatically rejected if you do not send them within 15 days of making your application.</p>

<h2>Evidence guidance</h2>

<h3>Photo identification</h3>

<p>We match your photograph against our systems to ensure we send personal information to the right person. This helps us keep your personal information safe.</p>

<p>Photo identification can include a copy of your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>biometric residence card</li>
  <li>national identity card</li>
  <li>travel document</li>
</ul>

<p>If none of the above is available then you will need to send a recent photograph.</p>

<p>Please do not send original documents but a good quality clear colour photocopy is required.</p>

<h3>Letter of permission</h3>

<p>This can be a short letter or statement. We use this to be sure that you want your records to be sent to you and, if someone is applying on your behalf, that you have given your authority for them to do so.</p>

<p>The letter must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that you give permission for your records to be sent to you</li>
  <li>confirmation that you give permission for your records to be sent to a third party representative – if they are completing the application on your behalf</li>
  <li>your signature and the date, within the last 6 months – please note your signature as well as your photo identification is used to verify that the person making the request is entitled to do so</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are completing this application for a child under 12; have the power of attorney for an applicant; or are a litigation friend, you can sign the letter of permission on the applicant’s behalf.</p>

<h3>Proof of your relationship</h3>

<p>If you are making a request on behalf of a child under 12, you must provide evidence of your relationship so we are sure that you have the parental authority to do this.</p>

<p>This evidence can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a birth certificate</li>
  <li>proof of parental responsibility</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, if you are applying on behalf of someone because you have the power of attorney, or are a litigation friend, you must provide evidence of this.</p>

<h2>Contact and complaints</h2>

<h3>If you need help</h3>

<p>If you would like more information or help filling in your form, contact us by email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk">subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We prefer requests are not made by email as this may delay your application if we have to seek further information to verify your identity.</p>

<h3>Customer survey</h3>

<p>After you have made your application, we will send you a link to complete an online survey. Your feedback will help us understand how we can improve our service.</p>

<h3>Making a complaint</h3>

<p>The Office of the Data Protection Officer (ODPO) will investigate complaints in relation to suspected or identified breaches of subject rights under the DPA18.</p>

<p>This includes subject access rights, the ODPO expects that you would give SARU the opportunity to consider your concerns first and, subsequently, seek resolution via the Home Office complaints procedure (as detailed above), before taking a complaint to them.</p>

<p>Email customer services at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk">subjectaccessrequest@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that the ODPO is also unable to provide updates in relation to outstanding subject access requests.</p>

<p>You should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dpo@homeoffice.gov.uk">dpo@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>want to complain about the processing of your personal data</li>
  <li>want to complain to the Home Office Data Protection Officer</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your reference number</li>
  <li>the date the original request was made</li>
  <li>information on how you made the request, for example online or by post</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</h4>

<p>The ICO have a duty to adjudicate on individual complaints, as the regulator of the DPA, individuals have a right (at s165) to bring a complaint to the ICO.</p>

<p>However, the role of the ICO remains as a regulator, not an ombudsman. More often, the ICO use complaints to help build up a picture of a data controller’s general compliance which will then inform decisions as to whether we need to take more formal enforcement action.</p>
