<p>The Surveillance and Immunity studies are part of the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) that is responsible for managing several major studies to understand coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>). We collaborate with a number of delivery partners, including the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/" rel="external">Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>)</a>, research, academic and commercial partners.</p>

<p>We have now begun a new phase of living with the SARS-CoV-2, as outlined in the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Response: Living with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> plan that was published on 21 February 2022. The Government will continue monitoring the virus through maintaining scaled back surveillance studies and other data sources including genomic sequencing. The studies help inform current and future Government policy decisions.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Infection Survey</h3>

<p>April 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>The <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Infection Survey (<abbr title="COVID-19 Infection Survey">CIS</abbr>) started in April 2020 and is being delivered with the University of Oxford, IQVIA and other partners.</p>

<p>This study uses repeat household visits to establish the proportion of the general population who have SARS-CoV-2. Participants are tested whether they report having symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> or not. Blood samples are also taken from a proportion of participants to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p>

<p>This study was originally set up to gather data from England, but has been expanded to include Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The study tests 150,000 participants every fortnight.</p>

<abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> surveillance study in care homes (Vivaldi)</h3>

<p>This major care home study was started in May 2020. The study is run by University College London and other academic partners.</p>

<h3>Vivaldi 1</h3>

<p>May 2020 to June 2020</p>

<p>This study was launched in May 2020 and focuses on understanding what proportion of care home healthcare workers and residents in England tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the virus’ transmission routes and mitigating factors within care homes. Residents and carers received swab testing through the national care home testing programme, whilst care home managers took part in a national telephone survey.</p>

<h3>Vivaldi 2</h3>

<p>June 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>This study was launched in June 2020 and builds on the findings of Vivaldi 1. The cohort study has expanded its initial set of 100 care homes in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fshc.co.uk/" rel="external">Four Seasons Health Care</a> chain to cover approximately 340 homes in England and 15,000 participants.</p>

<p>Vivaldi 2 uses trained phlebotomists to draw blood from care-home residents and staff, which is then used to test for both antibody and cellular immune responses to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. This data is cross-referenced with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>-delivered swab testing in care homes to provide a detailed picture of prevalence, seroprevalence, transmission and immunity over time.</p>

<p>The study also provides data on the efficacy of the vaccine as the mass-vaccination programme is rolled out in care homes nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, samples of venous blood from care-home residents participating in Vivaldi 2 are undergoing immunological analyses to explore cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. This research, conducted by the University of Birmingham, is an integral part of the Vivaldi project and is sometimes known as ‘Vivaldi 3’.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> Schools Infection Survey</h3>
<p>October 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>Commissioned by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr> collects data and conducts analysis, alongside <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> (formerly Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>)) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (<abbr title="London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine">LSHTM</abbr>), to understand and assess SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its transmission within schools. Phase 1 of the study (SIS1), which concluded in July 2021, involved repeated antibody and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing of students and staff, drawn from up to 150 schools (both primary and secondary) in England. Phase 2 (SIS2, from autumn 2021) focuses on antibody testing, whilst acquiring insights into pupils’ health and wellbeing as well as preventative measures implemented in schools.</p>

<h2>Immunity studies</h2>

<h3>Sars-CoV-2 Immunity and REinfection EvaluatioN (SIREN)</h3>

<p>June 2020  – ongoing</p>

<p>This is a major study testing blood samples and swabs obtained from healthcare workers who work in a clinical setting to see if infection with SARS-CoV-2 protects them from future episodes of infection. The study also assesses vaccine effectiveness and the effect of antibody protection against variants.</p>

<p>It was set up in April 2020 to assess the risk of re-infection in healthcare workers who have tested positive for antibodies.</p>

<h3>Protective Immunity from T-Cells in Healthcare workers (PITCH) – <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</h3>

<p>March 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>This study is a partnership between multiple universities to understand the T-cell responses in healthcare workers. It focuses on the immunity that might come from having been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and what this means. Following the rollout of the <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines, the study is also analysing how vaccination alters people’s T cell response to fight the virus.</p>
