<p>Robust population surveillance programmes are essential to understand the rate of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection, and how the virus is spreading across the country. They help us to assess the impact of measures taken so far to contain the virus, to inform current and future actions, and to develop new tests and treatments.</p>

<p>Pillar 4 of the UK testing strategy is managing a number of major studies to understand to what extent COVID-19 is present and affecting the wider population.</p>

<p>It also includes looking at how the immune system has responded to the virus and how this varies over time. We will use the data and insight generated from these studies to help strengthen our scientific understanding of COVID-19, inform government policy decisions and work across the testing programme.</p>

<p>As part of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) within NHS Test and Trace, we are working with a range of partners, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england" class="govuk-link">Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>)</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>)</a>, industry and academia in order to deliver these studies.</p>

<h2>Surveillance studies</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 Infection Survey – Office for National Statistics</h3>

<p>April 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) was started in April 2020 and is being delivered with the University of Oxford, <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/about-us/commitment-to-public-health/covid-19-resources" class="govuk-link" rel="external">IQVIA</a>, and other partners. It is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>).</p>

<p>This study uses repeat household visits to establish the proportion of the general population who have COVID-19. Participants are tested whether they report having symptoms of COVID-19 or not. Blood samples are also taken from a proportion of participants to test for COVID-19 antibodies.</p>

<p>This study was originally set up to gather data from England, but has now been expanded to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The study tests 150,000 participants every fortnight.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1</h3>

<p>April 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>The <abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-1 study was launched in April 2020. It is a large population study that estimates the prevalence of the virus causing COVID-19 in the general population in England. It also estimates how quickly the virus transmits between people (R value). Over 150,000 unique participants take part each month and provide insights about COVID-19.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2</h3>

<p>May 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>The <abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2 study started in May 2020 to estimate how many people have already had COVID-19 in England and to learn more about changes in antibodies levels in the population.</p>

<p>This study involves approximately 150,000 unique people over a 6-week period who all used a finger prick test. Additional information is collected on contact with known cases to estimate an infection point prevalence at national, regional and local levels. <abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission">REACT</abbr>-2 has also helped scientists learn more about the usability and accuracy of different antibody tests.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 surveillance study in care homes (Vivaldi)</h3>
<p>This major care home study was started in May 2020, is being run by University College London and funded by the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Vivaldi 1</h3>

<p>May 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>This study launched in May and focusses on understanding what proportion of care home healthcare workers and residents in England are positive for COVID-19, as well as the disease’s transmission and mitigation factors within care homes. As part of this study residents and carers receive swab testing, through the national care home testing programme, whilst care home managers take part in a national telephone survey.</p>

<h3>Vivaldi 2</h3>

<p>June 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>This study was launched in June 2020 and builds on the findings of Vivaldi 1. The cohort study has expanded its initial set of 100 care homes in the Four Seasons Healthcare chain (FHSC) to cover approximately 340 homes in England and 15,000 participants.</p>

<p>Vivaldi 2 uses trained phlebotomists to draw blood from care-home residents and staff, which is then used to test for both antibody and cellular immune responses to COVID-19. This data is cross-referenced with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>-delivered swab testing in care homes to provide a detailed picture of prevalence, seroprevalence, transmission and immunity over time.</p>

<p>The study will also provide data on the efficacy of the vaccine as the mass-vaccination programme is rolled out in care-homes nationwide.</p>

<h3>sKIDs surveillance study – <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>June to September 2020</p>

<p>At the beginning of June, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> launched this pilot in partnership with the Department for Education through funding from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<p>The study focused on providing a better understanding of prevalence in pre and primary schools in the last half of the summer term after national lockdown measures began to ease. It was designed to provide the government with insights to inform the response to the virus and management of education settings in a safe and secure way.</p>

<p>This small pilot focused on blood and swab tests of pre-school, primary and staff from 130 schools from across England to better understand rates of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Immunity studies</h2>

<h3>Sars-CoV-2 Immunity &amp; REinfection EvaluatioN (SIREN) – <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>June 2020  – ongoing</p>

<p>This is a major study testing blood samples and swabs obtained from healthcare workers who work in a clinical setting to see if infection with COVID-19 protects them from future episodes of infection. The study will also assess vaccine efficacy and the effect of antibody protection against COVID-19 variants.</p>

<p>It was set up by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> in April 2020 in response to the need to assess the risk of re-infection in those who have tested positive for antibodies.</p>
