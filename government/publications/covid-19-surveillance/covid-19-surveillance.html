<p>Robust population surveillance programmes are essential to understanding the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the virus is spreading across the country. They help us to assess the impact of measures taken to contain the virus, to inform current and future government actions.</p>

<p>The Surveillance and Immunity Directorate of the UK Health Security Agency’s (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) is taking forward <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes" class="govuk-link">Pillar 4 of the UK testing strategy</a>. Under this strategy, the directorate’s remit is to commission and manage a number of major studies to understand to what extent COVID-19 (the disease caused by the virus) is present and affecting the wider population.</p>

<p>This also includes looking at how the immune system has responded to SARS-CoV-2 and how this varies over time. We use the data and insights generated from these studies, including analysis of the impact of the vaccine rollout, to help strengthen our scientific understanding of COVID-19, inform the government’s policy decisions and work across the testing programme.</p>

<p>We collaborate with a number of delivery partners, including the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office of National Statistics">ONS</abbr>)</a>, research, academic and commercial partners.</p>

<h2>Surveillance studies</h2>

<h3>COVID-19 Infection Survey – Office for National Statistics</h3>

<p>April 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) was started in April 2020 and is being delivered with the University of Oxford, IQVIA and other partners.</p>

<p>This study uses repeat household visits to establish the proportion of the general population who have SARS-CoV-2. Participants are tested whether they report having symptoms of COVID-19 or not. Blood samples are also taken from a proportion of participants to test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.</p>

<p>This study was originally set up to gather data from England, but has been expanded to include Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The study tests 150,000 participants every fortnight.</p>

<h3>Vivaldi 2</h3>

<p>June 2020 – ongoing</p>

<p>This study was launched in June 2020 and builds on the findings of Vivaldi 1. The cohort study has expanded its initial set of 100 care homes in the Four Seasons Healthcare chain (FHSC) to cover approximately 340 homes in England and 15,000 participants.</p>

<p>Vivaldi 2 uses trained phlebotomists to draw blood from care-home residents and staff, which is then used to test for both antibody and cellular immune responses to COVID-19. This data is cross-referenced with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>-delivered swab testing in care homes to provide a detailed picture of prevalence, seroprevalence, transmission and immunity over time.</p>

<p>The study also provides data on the efficacy of the vaccine as the mass-vaccination programme is rolled out in care homes nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, samples of venous blood from care-home residents participating in Vivaldi 2 are undergoing immunological analyses to explore cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2. This research, conducted by the University of Birmingham, is an integral part of the Vivaldi project and is sometimes known as ‘Vivaldi 3’.</p>
