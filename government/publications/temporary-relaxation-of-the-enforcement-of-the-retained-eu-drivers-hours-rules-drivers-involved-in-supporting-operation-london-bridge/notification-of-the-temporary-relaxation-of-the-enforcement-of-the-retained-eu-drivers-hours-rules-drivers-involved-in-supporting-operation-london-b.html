<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) has introduced a temporary relaxation of the enforcement of the EU drivers’ hours rules in England, Scotland and Wales for drivers involved in the delivery of Operation London Bridge during the National Mourning period.</p>

<p>This relaxation reflects the urgent case resulting from the demise of&nbsp;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the need for substantial amounts of goods and numbers of personnel to be moved at short notice to support the main official ceremonial events taking place across Great Britain (for example, but not restricted to, Her Majesty’s State Funeral).</p>

<h2>Timing of the relaxation</h2>

<p>The relaxation of the rules applies from 4pm on 9 September 2022 until 11:59pm on 22 September 2022.</p>

<p>The current situation is being kept under review and the department reserves the right to withdraw or amend the relaxation.</p>

<h2>Scope of the relaxation</h2>

<p>The relaxation applies to anyone driving under the EU drivers’ hours rules involved in the delivery of Operation London Bridge during the period of National Mourning.</p>

<p>This relaxation does not apply to drivers in scope of the GB domestic drivers’ hours rules and therefore not subject to tachograph controls.</p>

<p>Drivers’ hours rules are an important road safety measure and any deviation from the rules must be a last resort when other means of mitigating a situation have failed.&nbsp; Therefore, the temporary exceptions to the drivers’ hours rules must only be used where necessary by drivers and transport operators.</p>

<p>Driver safety must not be compromised. Operators and self-employed drivers must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/workplacetransport/management/risk.htm" rel="external">assess the risks</a> of using the temporary relaxation and implement suitable control measures and/or mitigations, so that the safety of the driver and others is not compromised.</p>

<p>Transport managers should make sure that a risk assessment has been carried out and appropriate controls put in place. They should also continue to monitor and review where necessary, as long as the relaxation is used.</p>

<p>It is important to consider the risk of fatigue and the effect of the relaxation on shift patterns. Information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/toolbox/organisation/shiftwork.htm" rel="external">fatigue and shift work</a> is available.</p>

<p>It is also essential that use of the relaxation is agreed genuinely with the drivers involved, including in the light of a driver’s specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Drivers continue to be bound by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/639/contents/made" rel="external">Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2005</a>. This legally limits the amount of working time (including driving) a driver can do in any given week to a maximum of 60 hours, with an average of 48 hours a week calculated over a rolling 17 to 26-week period.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that a driver or the vehicle operator is breaking the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours">drivers’ hours rules</a> (including the terms of this temporary relaxation) or the working time regulations, this should be reported to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-a-lorry-bus-or-coach-driver-or-company">Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)</a>.</p>

<h2>Details of the relaxation</h2>

<p>The retained EU drivers’ hours rules can be temporarily relaxed as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Replacement of the normally permitted increase to daily driving limits from 9 to 10 hours up to twice in a week with one of 11 hours up to twice in a week. Practically, this means that a driver can drive for up to 11 hours on no more than 2 days in a single week, whilst all other daily driving limits remain at 9 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replacement of the requirement to take at least 2 weekly rest periods including 1 regular weekly rest period of at least 45 hours in a 2-week period, with an alternative pattern of weekly rest periods as specified below, and an increase to the fortnightly driving limit from 90 hours to 99 hours.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The alternative pattern of weekly rest periods for drivers using the relaxation related to weekly rest periods is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A regular weekly rest period is not required in a 2-week period provided 2 reduced weekly rest periods of at least 24 hours are taken.</li>
  <li>Following this, 2 regular weekly rest periods must be taken.&nbsp; However, any reduction in weekly rest shall be compensated for in the normal way by an equivalent period of rest taken before the end of the third week following the week in question.</li>
  <li>In addition, any rest taken as compensation for a reduced weekly rest period shall be attached to a regular weekly rest period of at least 45 hours (which can be split over 2 regular weekly rest periods).</li>
</ul>

<p>This relaxation must not be used in combination with existing rules for international driving, which allow for 2 consecutive reduced weekly rest periods in certain circumstances. It is not recommended that this relaxation be used for drivers engaged partly in international journeys.</p>

<p>All other drivers’ hours rules remain in force unchanged, including the requirement for drivers to take at a break period of at least 45 minutes after 4.5 hours of driving.</p>

<h2>Use of the relaxation</h2>

<p>The practical implementation of the temporary relaxation should be through agreement between employers and employees and driver representatives.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Operators must notify the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> if this relaxation is used by completing an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1103865/initial-notification-relaxation-form-until-22-sept-2022.odt" rel="external">initial notification of relaxation form</a> and emailing a copy to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FOLRnotification@dft.gov.uk">FOLRnotification@dft.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A completed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1103866/follow-up-notification-relaxation-form-until-29-sept-2022.odt" rel="external">follow-up notification of relaxation form</a> must then be emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FOLRnotification@dft.gov.uk">FOLRnotification@dft.gov.uk</a> by 29 September 2022 at the latest.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Failure to comply with the requirement to notify the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> would be an indication to enforcement authorities that the relaxation had been used inappropriately and follow-up investigatory action may occur.</p>

<p>In addition, when driving under the retained EU drivers’ hours rules, drivers must note on the back of their tachograph charts or printouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits. This is usual practice in emergencies and is essential for enforcement purposes.</p>

<p>The temporary relaxation must only be used where necessary (see advice under <a class="govuk-link" href="#scope-of-the-relaxation">Scope of the relaxation</a>). Otherwise the normal drivers’ hours rules should be followed.</p>

<p>The department wishes to make clear that driver safety must not be compromised. Drivers should not be expected to drive whilst tired. Employers remain responsible for the health and safety of their employees and other road users.</p>

<p>Please note that relaxations in relation to transport which are undertaken solely in the territory of Northern Ireland are a matter for the devolved authority.</p>

<p>All enquiries regarding interpretation of these temporary arrangements should be made to the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> using the following contact details:</p>
