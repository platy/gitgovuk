<h2>
<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening evaluation</h2>

<p>Parents and carers can decide if their baby will have screening for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>. Screening uses the same blood taken from the heel prick <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/newborn-screening/blood-spot-test/" rel="external">newborn blood spot screening test</a>. It does not require any additional blood spots.</p>

<p>Most babies will get a ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> not suspected’ result which means it is very unlikely they have <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>.</p>

<p>A ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> suspected’ result means it is more likely, but not certain, that the baby will have the condition.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> suspected results</h2>

<p>The newborn screening laboratory will contact the specialist immunology team if the blood spot shows ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> suspected’ within about a week of taking the initial blood spot.</p>

<p>The specialist immunology team will contact the parents or carers and invite them and their baby to attend an appointment within 2 working days.</p>

<p>At the appointment, an immunology specialist will examine the baby and offer the parents or carers a blood test (flow cytometry) for their baby.</p>

<p>Most flow cytometry results will be available the same day. The flow cytometry test will confirm if the baby:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> (needs further tests)</li>
  <li>has another condition affecting the immune system (needs further tests)</li>
  <li>does not have <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> or another condition (baby discharged)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Babies born before 37 weeks</h2>

<p>A small proportion of babies born at less than 37 weeks who have been screened for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> and are still in hospital will need a second sample at 37 weeks corrected gestation or on discharge, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p>The laboratory will request a second sample, if one is needed.</p>

<p>Where a repeat congenital hypothyroidism (<abbr title="congenital hypothyroidism">CHT</abbr>) sample is needed on discharge, the same blood spot sample can be used for this and the second <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> sample. There is no need for a second <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening sample if the initial sample was taken in the community, regardless of the gestation at birth.</p>

<h2>Areas offering <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr>
</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/when-is-bcg-tb-vaccine-needed/" rel="external"><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr></a> is a selective neonatal programme. Eligible babies are immunised, in line with the policy outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-the-green-book-chapter-32">chapter 32 of the Green Book</a>.</p>

<p>From 1 September 2021, there will be a change to the age at which parents or carers are offered the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination for their baby. This is necessary because the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> is a live vaccine and can make the treatment for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> more complicated.</p>

<p><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> should only be given to babies who have a ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> not suspected’ or ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> not offered’ result. Babies who have a ‘<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> suspected result’ should only be given <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> on the advice of a specialist.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> provider is responsible for checking the <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening result before giving the vaccine.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine should be given at about 28 days of age – by which time <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> results will be available.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening: movers in and movers out</h2>

<p>Most scenarios in which families move after a baby is born are straightforward. The following scenarios are to help blood spot sample takers.</p>

<h4>Scenario 1:</h4>
<p>Parents or carers initially lived in a <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area and had <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> information before their baby was born. However, they move to a non-<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area before their baby has blood spot screening.</p>

<h4>Action:</h4>
<p>Do not offer parents or carers <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening as part of the blood spot sample. Send blood spot card to the newborn screening laboratory following the usual process.</p>

<h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
<p>First blood spot sample taken in a non-<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area. Baby needs a repeat sample, by which time the parents or carers have moved to a <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area.</p>

<h4>Action:</h4>
<p>Do not offer the parents or carers <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening as part of the repeat blood spot sample and do not provide information about <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>. Midwives should tick the ‘repeat’ box on the card and send the blood spot card to the newborn screening laboratory following the usual process.</p>

<h4>Scenario 3:</h4>
<p>First blood spot sample taken in a <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area. Baby needs a repeat sample, by which time the parents or carers have moved into a non-<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening area.</p>

<h4>Action:</h4>
<p>Offer parents or carers <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening as part of a repeat blood spot sample. Midwives should tick the ‘repeat’ box on the card and send the blood spot card to the newborn screening laboratory following the usual process.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening: research into parents’ views and experiences</h2>

<p>As part of newborn blood spot screening, parents should be asked if they are happy to be contacted by researchers to take part in a research project. Any such project is approved by a research ethics committee. The consent to research contact, applies to any research contact, not just to research for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>.</p>

<p>Midwives are not seeking parents’ consent to be part of research. Parents are being asked to consent to be contacted by the researchers, who will explain what is involved and ask whether the parents wish to take part.</p>

<p>Separate consent for research contact is not required in relation to <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>. If the parents do not want to be contacted by researchers, write ‘decline research contact’ on the blood spot card.</p>

<p>If a parent declines research contact, their baby can still be screened for <abbr title="severe combined immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> and the other conditions. It is very important that this wording is used, so that it is clear that research contact is being declined and not the screening test.</p>
