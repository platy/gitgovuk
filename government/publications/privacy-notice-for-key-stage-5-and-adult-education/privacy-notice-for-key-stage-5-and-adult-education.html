<h2>Sharing your personal data</h2>

<p>We share your personal data with other parts of&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, and third parties, including other government departments, agencies, local authorities and organisations, where the law allows it or we have a legal duty to do this.</p>

This may be where a training provider has stopped trading. To help you continue learning,&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will arrange to securely transfer your information from your last training provider to your next training provider or to&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>&nbsp;if your learning does not continue straight away.

<ul>
  <li>the&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>&nbsp;and training providers share data to make sure information held about you and your funded learning is accurate</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>&nbsp;and your training provider may need to share your information with another training provider (for example, to confirm a claim for funding from&nbsp;<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) and with an awarding organisation (for example, to confirm what stage your learning has reached)</li>
</ul>
