<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care recognises that not all settings undertaking NHS services received personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) from central supplies when they needed it. This occurred despite an unprecedented effort across government to purchase and distribute COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> products to all settings requiring it as part of infection control measures.</p>

<p>The department has considered for each contracting group, whether there are additional cost pressures that have not already been met, and if so, the most appropriate mechanism to meet the additional costs incurred by purchase of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before central provision was fully stood-up. COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is classed as the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that providers are required to use over and above business-as-usual (BAU) use, due to COVID-19 infection control guidance, rather than what would have been used pre-pandemic.</p>

<p>For some providers of primary care services, the nature of contracting arrangements during the pandemic, and the nature of their requirement for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, prompted the department to work with partners in the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group to put in place a scheme for these providers to submit reimbursement claims at individual contractor level. These claims are for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased where such items could not be supplied centrally. These contracting groups are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general practice</li>
  <li>dentistry</li>
  <li>pharmacy</li>
</ul>

<p>For other primary care contracting groups, the department has concluded that the costs of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> incurred during the pandemic (where <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> could not be supplied centrally) before 31 December have either already been met through contracting arrangements put in place during the pandemic, or are met most efficiently and effectively through alternative means to a claims-based reimbursement system. This decision is based on advice received from NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) and representative professional bodies.</p>

<p>For providers where an individual claims-based reimbursement process will operate, they will be able to make reimbursement claims towards <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> bought from 27 February to 31 December 2020 for use in delivery of NHS clinical services by 31 March 2021. There will be no further entitlement to reimbursement for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased after 31 December 2020 as supply via central channels has been fully extended to all providers delivering NHS clinical services through the e-Portal channel.</p>

<h2>Model of reimbursement</h2>

<p>The model for each contracting group has been developed with an acknowledgement that demand and use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in delivering services changed over time since the outbreak of the pandemic. It is recognised that operating model guidance across all contractor groups changed as part of the need to respond flexibly to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>It was necessary to meet the aspiration to maintain usual services where possible while protecting the safety of patients and staff. It is also recognised that infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) guidance was updated over time as scientists learned more about the novel coronavirus COVID-19 and adjusted infection control measures accordingly.</p>

<p>The reimbursement scheme applies only to the types of personal protective equipment as laid out in the Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) guidance. Any additional costs incurred by providers as part of the COVID-19 response are exempt from this process.</p>

<p>The reimbursement scheme has been constructed with the aim of making the process as simple as possible for providers to claim, and to minimise the administrative burden. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, with <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>, has considered the following elements when determining claims thresholds in which it is anticipated most providers eligible to submit claims in this scheme will fall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>infection control guidance application relevant to each contracting group’s service delivery</li>
  <li>operating guidance to the contracting group over time</li>
  <li>modelled quantities of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> it is expected will have been used based on provider size and service delivery</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> item costs at the height of the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>It is acknowledged that the modelled approach will not capture the circumstance of each provider. Therefore, any claims that meet the criteria of the scheme but fall outside the modelled thresholds for ‘standard’ claims will be considered as part of the scheme, subject to relevant evidence for the claim being submitted. These will be referred to as ‘exceptional’ claims.</p>

<p>It is recognised that for some aspects of service delivery in the pandemic, or where local risk assessment deemed it necessary, higher grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> may have been required across different settings. In such cases, contractors are asked to submit any risk assessments undertaken in support of such claims.</p>

<h2>Reimbursement mechanisms</h2>

<h3>General practice</h3>

<p>For general practice, the reimbursement process will be undertaken by clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) or <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> regional teams where the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> is not delegated on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. Payments will be made by <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> or <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> regional teams to claimants following approval of a submitted claim.</p>

<p><abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> or the region will communicate with GP practices outlining how the process will work. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppe-reimbursement-for-non-hospital-providers/appendix-a-instructions-to-gp-commissioners-on-covid-19-ppe-reimbursement-process" class="govuk-link">Instructions to <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> on requirements in administering the scheme can be found in Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>The period in which claims can be submitted to <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> will open as soon as possible and close on 5 February 2021.</p>

<p><abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> will confirm with GP practices the local arrangements.</p>

<p>General practice contractors will be able to submit claims for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 for use in the delivery of NHS general practice services as a result of COVID-19 infection control guidance.</p>

<p>Standard COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for general practice are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type IIR masks</li>
  <li>aprons</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>eye protection (visors and goggles)</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>clinical waste bags</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dentistry</h3>

<p>For dental contractors, the reimbursement process will be undertaken by NHS Business Services Authority (<abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr>) on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. Payments will be made by <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> to claimants following approval of a successful claim.</p>

<p>Dental contractors will be able to submit claims for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 for use in the delivery of NHS dental services as a result of COVID-19 infection control guidance.</p>

<p>Standard COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for dental contractors are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type IIR masks</li>
  <li>FFP2/3 masks</li>
  <li>gowns (sterile and non-sterile)</li>
  <li>aprons</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>eye protection (visors and goggles)</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>clinical waste bags</li>
</ul>

<p>Activity modelling for thresholds underpinning ‘standard’ claims considers the dental operating model and contracting arrangements throughout different periods of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The period in which dental contractors can submit claims via the COMPASS portal will be announced soon and is expected to be as soon as possible. Contractors will receive further information confirming the go live date and arrangements for submitting a claim.</p>

<h3>Pharmacy</h3>

<p>For pharmacy contractors, the reimbursement process will be undertaken by <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, as set out in the Drug Tariff. Payments will be made by <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> to claimants following approval of a successful claim.</p>

<p>Pharmacy contractors are eligible to claim for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that was purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 for use in the delivery of NHS pharmaceutical services up to 31 March 2021 as a result of COVID-19 infection control guidance.</p>

<p>Claims must be submitted on the MYS portal. Pharmacy branches that are part of a multiple (defined as having 6 or more branches) should consult their head office on whether claims will be made at either branch or head office level. Dispensing appliance contractors are eligible to claim the standard payment based on their dispensing volumes in the same way as pharmacies.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The deadline to submit claims is 12 February 2021.</p>
</div>

<p>The standard items that can be claimed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aprons</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>type IIR masks</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser</li>
</ul>

<p>Between 27 February 2020 and 30 June 2020, any protective equipment purchased in substitution for unavailable standard items can be covered under standard claims.</p>

<h2>Timelines</h2>

<p>The department’s intention is to go live with the relevant reimbursement claims process as soon as is practical for each contracting group. The reimbursement process is tailored to each contracting group with the aim of it being as straightforward as possible and aligning as far as possible to existing payment mechanisms. The department has also engaged professional bodies with a view to determining the most suitable reimbursement model for each group.</p>

<p>Each contracting group will have its own process and timetable for how the reimbursement scheme will operate and will be confirmed by the relevant body administering the scheme for each contacting group on behalf of the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. Guidance relating to the remaining contractor groups will be made available by the administrators of the scheme on behalf of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> once the details of their arrangements are finalised.</p>
