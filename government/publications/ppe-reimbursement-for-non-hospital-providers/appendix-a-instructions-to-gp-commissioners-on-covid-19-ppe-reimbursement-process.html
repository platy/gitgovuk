<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> The claims process</h2>

<p>This finance guidance is to support commissioners in the administering of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) costs in relation to COVID-19 pursuant to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/C0651-covid-support-fund-letter-aug-2020.pdf" rel="external">NHS England and NHS Improvement’s (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) letter of 4 August 2020</a> and the associated guidance, The COVID Support Fund – Finance Process Guidance for <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Both documents stated that further instructions were to follow from the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>). This document contains those instructions. These instructions supersede the instructions relating to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in The COVID Support Fund – Finance Process Guidance for <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Commissioners (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> or NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) regional teams where the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> is not delegated) can use locally designed forms to capture the relevant information from GP practices. It is up to the commissioner to determine the design of the form that would most efficiently align with their operating practices. Existing forms can be either adapted, new forms designed, or appendices requested to be submitted alongside existing forms. However, the following information must be captured and held by the commissioner in the administration of the scheme in some form and provided to <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> or <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> if requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quantity and type of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased being claimed in this process with evidence that it has not formed part of a previous COVID-19 fund claim</li>
  <li>time period of purchasing</li>
  <li>associated evidence of spend, for example invoices</li>
  <li>staff risk assessments and clinical assessments to support claims for any items not listed in this guidance</li>
  <li>claims declaration form (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b-declaration">Annex B</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> The claim process dates</h2>

<p>Commissioners can go live with the process as soon as practically possible. The claims submission window period for GPs should run until 5 February 2021, after which no further claims can be considered.</p>

<p>This is for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr><sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> items purchased from 27 February 2020 to 31 December 2020, for use in the delivery of NHS general practice services in line with COVID-19 infection control guidance.</p>

<p>Practices should already be obtaining their COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge through the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> portal and no further reimbursement will be made for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased after the date of 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Claims must be for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is intended for use prior to 31 March 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Eligible items for reimbursement</h2>

<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for general practice are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type I/IIR masks</li>
  <li>aprons</li>
  <li>gloves</li>
  <li>eyewear (visors and goggles)</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser</li>
  <li>clinical waste bags</li>
</ul>

<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is classed as the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that providers are required to use over and above business-as-usual use, due to COVID-19 infection control guidance, rather than what would have been used pre-pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Practice claim process</h2>

<p>Practices should submit all claims for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to their commissioner (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> or regional team where their <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> is not delegated) by 5 february 2021.</p>

<p>Claims should be accompanied by any associated evidence and invoices. Any claims submitted without evidence and invoices should be returned to the practice.</p>

<p>Where any item of information or evidence is not provided, then the commissioner must not approve the claim and must contact the GP claimant to request the information is provided. Only when all relevant information is received, and the commissioner has assured itself that standard claims criteria is met can the payment be made.</p>

<p>Practices should not submit claims for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for which they have already been reimbursed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Commissioner review process</h2>

<p>The commissioner (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> or Regional Team where their <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> is not delegated) will receive claims for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs already incurred with any associated evidence or invoices.</p>

<p>The commissioner should follow this guidance in approving and validating these claims to ensure the spend is eligible and justified. The commissioner should assess claims based on the published guidance whether claims fall within the ‘standard’ claim thresholds. Claims that fall within these thresholds with evidence provided as outlined, can be paid out by the commissioner. Where any item of information or evidence is not provided, then the commissioner must not approve the claim and must contact the GP claimant to request the information is provided. Only when all relevant information is received, and the commissioner has assured itself that standard claims criteria is met can the payment be made.</p>

<p>Where the commissioner has already approved claims they should check the supporting information is in line with this guidance and seek additional information if required.
Where the claim is not approved the commissioner will reject and return to the practice to review and resubmit if appropriate.</p>

<p>The commissioner needs to ensure that checks are in place to ensure there is no duplication of reimbursement of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> claims.</p>

<p>Commissioners will need to assess all claims against the following criteria before authorising payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>invoices for the period covered</li>
  <li>practice open during the claim period</li>
  <li>date practice signed up to the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal to receive free COVID-19 related <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>only eligible items have been claimed for</li>
  <li>thresholds criteria has been considered</li>
  <li>check against any previous payments made to the practice in relation to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>standard approval procedures used by the commissioner</li>
</ul>

<p>Records should be maintained on the verification checks undertaken, the number of rejected claims and the amount of funding not paid due to verification checks identifying incorrect submissions for counter fraud monitoring purposes.</p>

<h3>Threshold criteria</h3>

<p>Practice claims should be defined as either standard or exceptional claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard claims: fall within their practice list size banded rate to cover standard COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use from 27 February 2020 to 31 December 2020. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">Table 1</a> below</li>
  <li>exceptional claims: cover any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 in excess of the standard claim value and/or outside the standard COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items and to be used prior to 31 March 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>To support commissioners to consider the validity of claims, <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">Table 1</a> below identifies which claims can be considered standard, with all others being treated as exceptional claims. The thresholds are based on modelling to benchmark valid monthly costs that practices would have incurred for medical grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Assumptions underpinning modelling of ‘standard’ claims</h3>

<p>Modelled costs within ‘standard’ claim thresholds take into account the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>activity assumptions based on:
    <ul>
      <li>registered list size (from NHS Digital reported data)</li>
      <li>average face-to-face activity (NHS Digital reported data)</li>
      <li>adjusted by proportion of contractors registered on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> e-Portal by September 2020</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements based on assumed activity under PHE infection control (IPC) guidance</li>
  <li>cost of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> based on March to June wholesaler prices</li>
</ul>

<p>For standard claims the modelling assumes <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used between 27 February and 31 October was procured outside of the portal and for 1 November onwards was supplied via the portal.</p>

<p>General practice can submit claims that include amounts covering 1 November to 31 December, but these will be considered an ‘exceptional claim’ by the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>, as only a minority of practices were still not signed up to the portal in this period.</p>

<p>Commissioners must also consider whether the practice has followed PHE guidance in using the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for which it is claiming.</p>

<h3>Standard claims</h3>

<p>Where a standard claim is received for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that meets the reimbursement criteria and is within the claim thresholds detailed below the commissioner can approve reimbursement to the practice.
Commissioners may approve payment of standard claims that exceed the amounts in Table 1 by 10%, where it can be demonstrated this is justified and evidenced.</p>

<h3>Exceptional claims</h3>

<p>Where an exceptional claim is received that exceeds the claim thresholds in Table 1 or does not meet the reimbursement criteria in section 5 then the commissioner may require explanation or further evidence to be submitted.</p>

<p>For any claims that the commissioner considers to be in the exceptional criteria, they will want to request further evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff risk assessments for any higher-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used</li>
  <li>activity levels for the claim period</li>
  <li>whether the practice is a designated hub for patients displaying COVID positive symptoms (see <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> guidance on the operation of hot hubs/sites for COVID patients)</li>
  <li>is the practice delivering flu vaccines on behalf of other practices</li>
</ul>

<p>Where claims relate to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is outside the standard list – type I/IIR masks, aprons, gloves, eye wear (visors and goggles), hand sanitiser, clinical waste bags – the practice will need to be able to evidence the need for that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> if requested to do so.</p>

<p>Should a practice exceed its claim threshold by 25% then the commissioner should refer the claim to the <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> primary care regional team for further assurance, similar to the COVID-19 Support Fund process.</p>

<h3>Post-verification checks</h3>

<p>The commissioner will be required to carry out post-payment verification checks in line with the COVID  Support Fund process. Guidance on the post verification checks for the COVID Support Fund will be issued in due course.</p>

<p>The following information must be kept by the Commissioner and supplied to <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> if requested:</p>

<p>Full detail of claim and accompanying evidence submitted.</p>

<p>Full decision log by claim with rationale:</p>

<ul>
  <li>approved
    <ul>
      <li>standard claims must detail how the Commissioner assessed criteria was met and verification checks undertaken</li>
      <li>payment records</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>approved based on amendment/further detail:
    <ul>
      <li>reason for initial rejection</li>
      <li>rationale for payment based on further evidence submitted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>rejections: rationale for rejection</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Commissioner/<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> finance claims process</h2>

<p>To ensure the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> funding is managed effectively, to support detailed analysis and to report accurately to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> there is an additional reporting requirement for commissioners to complete and return.</p>

<p>Commissioners should include the details of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> expenses in their non-ISFE submission. There is a specific column included on the COVID worksheet within non-ISFE for this.  This includes claims already approved.</p>

<p>This column must reconcile to the corresponding columns in the non-ISFE report.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Commissioner/<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> cash drawdown process</h2>

<p>Each month, each commissioner will need to collate the claims for the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs and include the request for the cash requirement within its main monthly drawdown.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Commissioner/<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> payment to practice process and coding</h2>

<p>Once the practice has submitted a claim for payment which has been approved the commissioner needs to process a Manual Payment transaction with a description of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs which must be coded to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> CORONAVIRUS A1 code, and</li>
  <li>the appropriate Practice A2 code and broken down using the following subjective codes:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Category</th>
      <th scope="col">Subjective   code</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">  <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>
</th>
      <td>52161002</td>
      <td>Clinical   and Medical Goods and Services – Supplies and Services – Clinical Other</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The transaction once approved will be available to pay on the Commissioner’s next scheduled payment run.</p>

<p>Commissioners should ensure that all payments recorded against the fund are coded correctly in the ledger, including retrospective ones.</p>

<p>Commissioners should check that all expenditure is correctly reflected each month in their non ISFE submission.</p>

<h2>Annex A: general practice COVID-19 reimbursement claim process flow</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>All claims made must be for eligible COVID-19 PPE purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 for use by 31 March 2021 to deliver NHS primary care medical services.</p>
</div>

<h3>Step 1: contractor submits claim form with invoice evidence to commissioner</h3>

<p>Standard claims need only submit invoice evidence.</p>

<p>Exceptional claims for values exceeding standard claims threshold and/or claims for non-eligible <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> may require further explanation or evidence to be submitted to the commissioner.</p>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> must be intended for use by 31 March 2021.</p>

<h3>Step 2: commissioner processes claim</h3>

<p>Standard claims are reimbursed following basic checks.</p>

<p>Exceptional claims may be subject to further checks to justify claim before eligible payment is made.</p>

<p>All claims will be checked against previous COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> reimbursement payments made and any adjustments made before payment.</p>

<h3>Step 3: pre and post-payment verification</h3>

<p>All claims submitted will be accompanied by invoice evidence as a pre-payment check.</p>

<p>Exceptional claims may require further evidence to be submitted, for example risk assessments.</p>

<p>All claims will be checked against previous COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> reimbursement payments made.</p>
