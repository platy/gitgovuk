<p>Due to the dental reimbursement scheme being operated by the NHS Business Services Authority (<abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr>), information on how to complete a claim will be provided via the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> COMPASS portal prior to the scheme going live on 18 January 2021.</p>

<h2>Claim dates</h2>

<p>Dental practices will be able to claim for personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) between 18 January and 20 February 2021, which means no claims will be accepted after 20 February 2021. Claims can only be made for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased between 27 February and 31 December 2020 for use in the delivery of NHS dental services as a result of COVID-19 infection control guidance.</p>

<p>COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for dentistry are defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>type IIR masks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FFP2/3 masks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gowns (sterile and non-sterile)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aprons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gloves</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eye protection (visors and goggles)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hand sanitiser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clinical waste bags</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> not included above (for example, higher-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) can still be submitted but will be considered exceptional claims and should have supporting risk assessments submitted with the claim.</p>

<p>Claims must be for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is intended for use prior to 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>Dental practices should already be obtaining their COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> free of charge through the DHSC portal and no further reimbursement will be made for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased after the date of 31 December 2020.</p>

<h2>Dental practice eligibility</h2>

<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 16.75% of NHS dental contracts was designated for variable costs for consumables, including <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. NHS England and NHS Improvement have continued to give dental providers 100% of their contract value throughout the year to date to account for the additional costs required to deliver services during the COVID-19 pandemic, including enhanced <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. As a result, dental providers that have delivered less than 45% of their pre-COVID-19 contracted activity value should not need to claim for reimbursement of their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs between 27 February and 31 December.</p>

<p>Practices which have delivered over 45% of their pre-COVID contracted activity should submit a claim for any additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs they have incurred, and which is not already covered by the full contract payment or pre-COVID <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs. For non-<abbr title="urgent dental care">UDC</abbr> (urgent dental care) practices, this period of activity is between the reopening of dental practices on 8 of June to 31 of December, meaning this threshold is equivalent to 26% of annual contracted delivery between 1 April and 31 December. For practices which are UDCs, this period is from 27 February 2020 to 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>Where a practice has delivered below 45% of their pre-COVID contracted activity but believes they have incurred legitimate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs over the threshold set out, they should submit a claim. This will be considered an exceptional claim. More information on exceptional claims can be found below.</p>

<p>Claims will be subject to an amendment to account for the full contract payment already made to cover additional <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs. More information will be provided on this via the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> COMPASS system when it is live.</p>

<h2>Dental claims process</h2>

<p>Dental practices should submit their claims via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/compass" rel="external">COMPASS</a> system, which is administered by <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> reimbursement scheme go-live dates will be communicated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The information the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> COMPASS System will require to process your claim are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>quantity and type of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased being claimed in this process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>time period of purchasing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>associated evidence of spend, for example invoices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff risk assessments and clinical assessments to support claims for any items not listed above</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>claims declaration form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All claims will need to be submitted with associated evidence of spend, for example invoices in line with the guidance.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> will approve claims for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> reimbursement in line with the eligibility criteria within this guidance.</p>

<p>Practice claims will be defined as either standard or exceptional claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>standard claims: the practice is a <abbr title="urgent dental care">UDC</abbr> or has delivered over 45% of their contracted dental activity and is claiming for the period between 27 February and 31 December 2020</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exceptional claims: cover any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> purchased between 27 February 2020 and 31 December 2020 in excess of the standard claim value and/or outside the standard COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items and to be used prior to 31 March 2021. Practices delivering less than 45% of their full contractual dental activity, but who believe they are entitled to reimbursement fall into this route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The thresholds for standard claims are based on modelling to benchmark valid monthly costs that practices would have incurred for medical-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as outlined in infection control guidance.</p>

<h2>Standard and exceptional claims</h2>

<p>Where a standard claim is received for COVID-19 <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> has determined satisfies the reimbursement criteria and is within the claim thresholds detailed above then payment can be made.</p>

<p>Where an exceptional claim is received that exceeds the claim thresholds or does not meet the reimbursement criteria then the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> may require explanation or further evidence to be submitted.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> will assess all claims against the following criteria before authorising payment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>invoices for the period covered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>practice open during the claim period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> costs for the practice are not already covered by variable costs proportion of their undelivered activity (activity delivered to date is over 45% of their contract value)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>date practice signed up to the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal to receive free COVID-related <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For any claims that fall outside of standard criteria and are exceptional, the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> may in some cases request further evidence such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff risk assessments for any higher-grade <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>activity levels for the claim period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the practice is a designated <abbr title="urgent dental care">UDC</abbr> site</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where claims relate to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that is outside the standard – type IIR masks, FFP2/3 respirator masks, gowns, aprons, gloves, eye wear (visors and goggles), hand sanitiser and clinical waste bags – the practice will need to be able to evidence the clinical need for that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> if requested to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> when reviewing the claim will undertake checks to ensure any duplicate or previously paid claims are disregarded.</p>

<p>Where more information is required before the claim can be approved, the <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> will reject and return to the practice to review and resubmit if appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Should a practice exceed claim threshold by 25%, <abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHSBSA</abbr> will refer to the claim for review to a commissioning support unit.</p>

<p>Where a claim significantly exceeds the threshold or is contentious in nature, it may be referred to the Department of Health and Social Care.</p>

<h2>Assumptions underpinning modelling of ‘standard’ claims</h2>

<p>Modelled costs within ‘standard’ claim thresholds take into account the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>activity assumptions based on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>average face-to-face activity based on FP17 submissions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>adjustment by proportion of contractors registered on the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> e-Portal by September 2020</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements based on assumed activity under Public Health England infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cost of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> based on March to June wholesaler prices</p>
  </li>
</ul>
