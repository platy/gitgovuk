<p>Details of any changes to the previous version can be found in paragraph 1.2 of this notice.</p>

<p>This notice has been updated as a result of the UK leaving the EU.</p>

<p>This notice has also been amended to show the UK rules and requirement for transitional movements. The systems and procedures in this notice no longer apply to movements between Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and the EU. If you are importing or exporting excise goods to or from the EU after the end of the transition period you should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197">Receive goods into and remove goods from an excise warehouse (Excise Notice 197)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> About this notice</h3>

<p>This notice sets out the UK’s requirements for the commercial importation of excise goods already released for consumption in an EU member state. Such goods are referred to throughout this notice as duty-paid goods, and are normally available for purchase from cash and carries, supermarkets and wholesalers in the member state of dispatch.</p>

<p>It describes the standard scheme for importing such goods as an Unregistered Commercial Importer, as well as the Registered Commercial Importer and tax representative schemes.</p>

<p>It contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>general conditions and requirements</li>
  <li>application procedures</li>
  <li>duty payment procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>It also sets out your rights and obligations as an importer of duty-paid goods.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, the information given in this notice relates to the standard scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> What’s changed</h3>

<p>This notice has been amended to show the Great Britain rules and requirements for transitional movements.</p>

<h4>EU Exit transitional movements</h4>

<p>For further information about the transitional arrangements for movements between Great Britain and the EU, that started before the end of the transition period but are still in transit at the end of the transition period please see paragraph 1.3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/receive-goods-into-and-remove-goods-from-an-excise-warehouse-excise-notice-197">Notice 197 receipt into and removal from an excise warehouse of excise goods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Who should read this notice</h3>

<p>You must read this notice if you want to commercially bring into Northern Ireland excise goods from EU member states, which have already been duty-paid in the member state of dispatch. This includes traders in EU countries who are selling such goods remotely to private individuals in Northern Ireland (for example using the internet or mail order), and anyone wanting to act as a tax representative on behalf of such traders.</p>

<p>The fact that duty has been paid on the goods in an EU member state does not affect the requirement to secure the UK duty on commercial supplies of those goods, before they’re dispatched to Northern Ireland.</p>

<span class="number">3.2 </span> Do all duty-paid movements follow the same process</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, the information given in this notice relates to the standard scheme (also known as the Unregistered Commercial Importer (<abbr title="Unregistered Commercial Importer">UCI</abbr>) scheme).</p>

<p>The Registered Commercial Importer (<abbr title="Registered Commercial Importer">RCI</abbr>) scheme is almost identical to the standard one, but with a different accounting procedure. For further information about specific Registered Commercial Importer requirements, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect8">section 8</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want to sell duty-paid goods from an EU member state to private individuals in Northern Ireland (known as distance selling), for example, using the internet, you must appoint a Northern Ireland tax representative to account for the UK duty. For further information on distance selling and tax representatives, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect11">sections 11</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect12">12</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> How the standard duty-paid scheme works</h3>

<p>To take advantage of the standard duty-paid scheme you must follow a few basic procedures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>before undertaking any duty -paid movements of excise goods, you must provide the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> with advance information about the consignment by completing and returning form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-%20eu-member-state-hm4">Request to import excise goods bought duty -paid in an EU member state (HM4)</a> and secure payment of the UK duty due on the goods</li>
  <li>provide your supplier with evidence that the UK duty has been secured (the endorsed form HM4)</li>
  <li>notify any changes to the Duty-paid Movements team immediately</li>
  <li>advise the Duty-paid Movements team immediately of the arrival of the goods at the delivery address</li>
  <li>on completion of the movement, make sure that the duty and VAT due is paid in full, and</li>
  <li>if required, provide a certificate of receipt to your supplier</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find a link to a simplified flowchart of the standard duty-paid scheme in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect17">section 17</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Registering to receive goods which have been duty-paid in an EU member state</h3>

<p>You can receive goods through the standard duty-paid system without the need to be registered. HMRC will authorise each movement on a consignment by consignment basis on the receipt of a completed form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">Request to import excise goods bought duty-paid in an EU member state (HM4)</a> and payment of the UK duty on the goods.</p>

<p>However, if you want to pay the duty using deferment arrangements, you’ll need to apply to be authorised as a Registered Commercial Importer. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect8">section 8</a> for further information.</p>

<p>In addition, if you want to account for the duty on EU goods that are dispatched to a private individual in the UK (known as distance selling) then you must be authorised as a tax representative. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect12">section 12</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Receiving excise goods from suppliers based in non-EU countries</h3>

<p>You cannot use this scheme to receive goods from suppliers based in non-EU countries. This scheme can only be used to receive goods from EU member states.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Combining a purchasing trip with a holiday</h3>

<p>You can do this, but you must use one of the schemes for importing commercial duty-paid goods into the UK, as detailed in this notice. You must complete and return form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a> and secure the UK duty before you leave the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Using the UK duty-paid scheme if you’re based in an EU member state</h3>

<p>You can use the UK duty-paid scheme, as long as you follow all the procedures set out in this notice and comply with any conditions in force in your own member state. However, if the goods being imported are being delivered to a private individual in Northern Ireland, you must appoint a UK tax representative to account for the UK duty on your behalf (see sections 11 and 12).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> If you want to receive goods you’ve purchased from an EU supplier for personal use</h3>

<p>This form of transaction is known as ‘distance selling’ and the arrangements set out at <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect11">section 11</a> must be followed.</p>

<p>If you wish to receive excise goods in this manner, the person who sells you the goods is responsible for ensuring that the UK duty is paid before the goods are dispatched to you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Bringing excise goods in from an EU country</h3>

<p>If you want to import duty-paid goods, then you must follow one of the schemes set out in this notice.</p>

<p>If you want to import excise goods in duty-suspension, you may choose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for approval as a Registered Consignee and comply with the procedures described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-203a-registered-consignees">Excise Notice 203a: Registered Consignees</a>
</li>
  <li>use the services of a Registered Consignee acting on your behalf</li>
  <li>apply for approval as a Temporary Registered Consignee and comply with the procedures described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-204a-temporary-registered-consignees">Excise Notice 204A: Temporary Registered Consignees</a>, or</li>
  <li>use the services of an authorised warehousekeeper who receives goods on your behalf into an ‘excise warehouse’ (if you are the owner of goods held in duty-suspension, in an excise warehouse, you must be registered under the Warehousekeepers and Owners of Warehoused Goods Regulations 1999) - for more details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors/excise-notice-196-excise-goods-registration-and-approval-of-warehousekeepers-warehouse-premises-owners-of-goods-and-registered-consignors">Excise Notice 196: excise goods - registration and approval of warehousekeepers, warehouse premises, owners of goods and registered consignors</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Marking requirements for excise goods</h3>

<p>Subject to certain exceptions, alcohol in bottle sizes of 35cl or more with an alcoholic strength of 30% or more which are intended for retail sale in the UK must bear a duty stamp.</p>

<p>You can find more information about duty stamps in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect13">section 13</a> of this notice and in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme">Excise Notice DS5: UK Duty Stamps Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there are fiscal marking and health warning requirements that you must be aware of and follow if you intend to import tobacco products such as cigarettes or hand-rolling tobacco.</p>

<p>You can find more information about fiscal marking in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-476-tobacco-products-duty">Excise Notice 476: Tobacco Products Duty</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4.Before </span> you can receive goods</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Notifying HMRC of a consignment</h3>

<p>You should set aside enough time to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allow HMRC to receive and process your completed form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a> (including postal delays)</li>
  <li>allow your payment to clear, particularly if you choose to secure the duty using an unguaranteed cheque</li>
  <li>tell your supplier that the duty has been secured</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as we receive accurate and complete details from you, we aim to process your form HM4 within 15 working days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Information you must provide in support of your application</h3>

<p>Before HMRC returns your form HM4, endorsed with your unique reference number for that consignment, we will check that you’ve given us all the required information regarding trading details and information about the consignment.</p>

<p>This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name, address and business phone number</li>
  <li>details of your supplier and customers</li>
  <li>the Northern Ireland delivery address (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#para411">paragraph 4.11</a>)</li>
  <li>details of the consignment you want to import (for example, brand and quantities)</li>
  <li>details of the transporter you’ll use (including vehicle registration details), and</li>
  <li>details of any excise goods on which duty stamps should be affixed (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect13">section 13</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cannot provide these details we may not be able to process your form.</p>

<p>However, we accept that you may not know the details of the transporter or the vehicle registration number at the time of completion. You should let the Duty-paid Movements team know these details as soon as possible and certainly before arrival in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> How to complete form HM4</h3>

<p>There are notes for completion, which accompany the form. These provide full details of how to complete it.</p>

<p>If you are still in doubt after reading the notes, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Once completed, this form should be returned to the Duty-paid Movements team at the address given on the form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Tell us about any changes</h3>

<p>You need to immediately notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> of any changes to the information you’ve supplied.</p>

<p>We would expect you to notify us of these changes as soon as they become known, and certainly before arrival in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Failure to notify these changes may render the goods liable to forfeiture and you liable to a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> How to work out the duty</h3>

<p>We have given examples of how to calculate the duty for excise goods in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect18">Section 18</a>. Please refer to these and to <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect7">section 7 Calculation of the duty</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> When to pay the duty payable on the consignment</h3>

<p>Under the standard scheme, you must secure the total duty due on each consignment at the time of submitting your completed form HM4 to the Duty-paid Movements team for authorisation.</p>

<p>This amount becomes an actual duty payment once you’ve notified us of the receipt of the goods. Should the amount of duty payable subsequently change, for example, due to excesses or shortages, either a further payment may be required or, if you can show that you’ve overpaid excise duty, you’ll be entitled to a refund of that overpayment.</p>

<p>If you want to use a deferment account to secure the duty, you must apply to be authorised as a Registered Commercial Importer. For further information please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect9">section 9</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> Methods of payment</h3>

<p>HMRC will accept a Bacs payment, banker’s draft, postal order or cheque.</p>

<p>You should be aware that if you present a non-guaranteed cheque it can take up to 10 working days to clear. We are unable to fully process your form until your cheque has cleared.</p>

<p>If you pay by cheque and also need duty stamps to affix to bottles of spirits (see section 13), we will not provide them until the cheque clears.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> How to show you’ve secured the UK duty</h3>

<p>Once you’ve secured the UK duty, form HM4 will be returned to you, endorsed with a unique reference number for that consignment. If required, this reference number can be used to verify that you’ve secured the UK duty on those goods.</p>

<p>Goods should not be dispatched until you’ve notified your supplier of the unique reference number, which should then accompany the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> How to account for VAT</h3>

<p>If you are registered for VAT, you should account for acquisition VAT on your VAT return for the period covering the date of acquisition of the goods. You’ll find more details about this in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-725-the-single-market">VAT on movements of goods between Northern Ireland and the EU</a>.</p>

<p>If you are not registered for VAT, you must make arrangements to pay the VAT at the current rate on the total value of the goods, including the excise duty. You may use form HM4 to pay VAT, but you’ll not be able to calculate the actual VAT payable until you’ve obtained the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span> If you want to take delivery of more than one consignment</h3>

<p>You’ll need to apply for a separate form HM4 for each consignment.</p>

<p>If you are using the standard scheme you can only have a single valid <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a> at any one time.</p>

<p>This means that HMRC will only authorise another HM4 for a second consignment once you’ve notified us that the previous consignment has been received and you’ve paid any outstanding duties or taxes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span> If goods are to be delivered to more than one address</h3>

<p>If you are using the standard scheme, the goods must be delivered to your business premises, as stated on form HM4.</p>

<p>If you are authorised as a Registered Commercial Importer, you may arrange for the goods to be delivered to a business address, which must be stated on form HM4 for that movement. You’ll need to complete a separate form HM4 for each delivery address.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span> If your intended supplier does not have the goods you need</h3>
<p>As long as you notify HMRC before the goods are dispatched, you can change your intended supplier.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.13 </span> Changing your mind over the quantity and/or type of goods you want to import</h3>

<p>As long as you notify HMRC before the goods are dispatched, you can change your mind over the quantity or type of goods you want to import. Any additional duty must be secured with us before the movement can take place, which may affect the dispatch date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.14 </span> If you lose reference number</h3>

<p>If you lose your reference number for a particular consignment, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> by phone as soon as possible and ask them to provide you with a reminder.</p>

<p>It is very important that you know the reference number for a particular consignment, as you’ll need to quote it when contacting HMRC about any aspect of the movement, including informing us of the receipt of the goods. This number should also accompany the goods during the movement to avoid undue delay if stopped by the Border Force on arrival in Northern Ireland. For this purpose, we recommend that you arrange for form HM4, which we have endorsed with the reference number, to accompany the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.15 </span> If you do not need the reference number</h3>

<p>If you find that your circumstances have changed and you no longer need the reference number, you should notify the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team immediately</a>. They’ll advise you of what to do next.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.16 </span> Completed form accompanying the movement</h3>

<p>There is no legal requirement for the original form to accompany the movement. However, HMRC recommends that the goods are at least accompanied by the reference number provided by the Duty-paid Movements team for that consignment, to avoid any undue delay should it be stopped on arrival in Northern Ireland. As we endorse your form HM4 with this reference number, you may want to have a copy of this form to accompany the goods. Alternatively, your supplier may choose to add the reference number to the commercial documentation which must accompany the goods.</p>

<p>If the person transporting the goods is unable to provide a valid reference number for a movement, the goods may be delayed whilst checks are carried out to verify that the movement has been notified to us and the UK duty has been secured.</p>

<p>You should keep a copy of the form for your records. You should also quote your reference number when contacting us about your duty-paid consignment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.17 </span> Documents that must travel with the goods</h3>

<p>Unless they’re consigned under distance selling arrangements (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect11">section 11</a>), duty-paid movements of excise goods must be accompanied by a Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>) (copies 2 and 3) that complies with EU requirements. The goods must also be consigned to the person shown on the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> as the recipient.</p>

<p>It is normally up to your supplier to produce the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>, however you may produce one on behalf of your supplier. HMRC does not provide supplies of this document. Details of what information an <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> must include are contained in EU Commission Regulation 3649/92/EEC.</p>

<p>A commercial document can be used instead of an <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> provided that it contains the same information. The layout of data on commercial documents can differ, however each item of information must have the same box number as on the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>. You must make sure that such commercial documents are marked, ‘Simplified accompanying document (excise goods) for fiscal control purposes.’</p>

<p>If you import, or arrange for the importation of, excise goods without the appropriate and correctly completed accompanying documentation, and without prior payment of duty, the goods and vehicle will be liable to forfeiture, and you may be liable to civil penalty and may even face prosecution.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> After the goods have been received</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> When you receive the goods</h3>

<p>As soon as you receive the goods, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform the<a class="govuk-link" href="#movements"> Duty-paid Movements team</a>, by phone, of their arrival</li>
  <li>complete the certificate of receipt on the accompanying <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>
</li>
  <li>calculate, and account for, the UK VAT payable on the consignment</li>
  <li>return form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a> to the Duty-paid Movements team along with a copy of the receipted <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> and payment for any outstanding duty or VAT</li>
  <li>make sure that any goods which are required to bear a duty stamp have one affixed within 14 days of the importation of the goods (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect13">section 13</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll find further accounting information in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect7">section 7</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Certificate of receipt to provide to your supplier</h3>

<p>After unloading and checking the goods are complete, you must endorse copy 2 and 3 of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> to acknowledge receipt. Show the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date and place of receipt of the goods</li>
  <li>a description of the goods received</li>
  <li>if the goods agree with the accompanying document’s description, the words ‘consignment checked’ (if the goods do not agree with the consignor’s description, please follow the procedures set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect6">section 6</a> as appropriate)</li>
  <li>your reference number</li>
  <li>an authorised signature</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep in your records copy 2 of the accompanying document together with the receipted copy 3 (either the original, or a photocopy of this, where your supplier requires the original).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Documents to provide to HMRC</h3>

<p>You must get form HM4 to our Duty-paid Movements team within 4 business days of receipt of the goods. You should also supply a copy of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> for that movement. Please keep a copy of the form for your records. If you are not VAT registered, you should also enclose a banker’s draft, guaranteed cheque, or postal order for the total amount of UK VAT payable on the consignment.</p>

<p>We may not issue further HM4s where there are consignments still outstanding. It is in your interest, therefore, to return the correctly completed documentation to us within the required timescales.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Irregularities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> If the goods arrive without the accompanying document (<abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>)</h3>

<p>You must inform our Duty-paid Movements team immediately by telephone.</p>

<p>Excise goods found to be travelling in Northern Ireland without the appropriate accompanying document are liable to forfeiture, therefore you should take steps to make sure that a <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> travels with the goods at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> If the goods are not what you ordered</h3>

<p>If the goods are not what you ordered (for example, a different brand or product) you should still take full account of the goods when they arrive and advise the Duty-paid Movements team immediately by telephone.</p>

<p>If you subsequently decide to return the goods to the sender, then you may be able to reclaim the UK duty you’ve paid on them through the excise duty drawback scheme. For further information on the conditions and requirements for claiming drawback, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback">Excise Notice 207: Excise duty drawback</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> If you discover shortages on receipt</h3>

<p>You should bring any shortages to HMRC’s attention when submitting the completed form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you enter the actual goods received in your records.</p>

<p>The Duty-paid Movements team will advise you what steps to take to account for the duty on any chargeable losses in the consignment. If you can demonstrate that the loss is the result of the actual nature of the goods or an accident, we may not require payment of the duty. You should provide full details to the Duty-paid Movements team for us to consider on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>If you’ve over-paid any duty, you must submit a written request for repayment to us. Please enclose all relevant supporting documentation (for example, dispatch note, invoice, and copy of <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> If you discover excesses on receipt</h3>

<p>You must account for the UK duty on all excesses. Notify the Duty-paid Movements team immediately and they’ll give you advice on how to proceed.</p>

<p>If you subsequently decide to return the goods to the sender, then you may be able to reclaim the UK duty you’ve paid on them through the excise duty drawback scheme. For further information on the conditions and requirements for claiming drawback, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback">Excise Notice 207: Excise duty drawback</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not pay duty on any excess goods you receive they’ll be liable to forfeiture.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> If the goods do not arrive on the intended date</h3>

<p>As soon as you become aware that the goods will not arrive on the intended date of arrival indicated on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a>, or have not arrived on the expected date, you should notify the Duty-paid Movements team.</p>

<p>Any changes of more than 24 hours to the expected date of arrival must be notified to the Duty-paid Movements team immediately. They’ll advise you what steps to take.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Calculation of the duty</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> How to work out the duty payable</h3>

<p>You are responsible for working out the correct UK duty due on each consignment, even if someone else works out the duty value on your behalf.</p>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determine the correct 3 digit tax type code for each product</li>
  <li>use the correct code for each class of goods received</li>
</ul>

<p>You should then calculate the duty due on the consignment. Section 16 provides examples to help you with your duty calculation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Rate to use</h3>

<p>You must use the rate in force for the type of goods you intend to receive at the time when the goods are received.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Finding more information about tax types and duty rates</h3>

<p>Current duty rates and tax types are published in Volume 1 of the Integrated Tariff of the UK. You can find the current duty rates in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rates-and-allowances-hm-revenue-and-customs">Rates and allowances</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Duty account</h3>

<p>You must keep a duty account in accordance with our guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-206-revenue-traders-records">Excise Notice 206: revenue traders’ records</a> summarising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all your transactions</li>
  <li>the duty which you are liable to pay</li>
</ul>

<p>The duty account and its supporting documents must show:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the duty due in each accounting period</li>
  <li>the excise duty point for each consignment</li>
  <li>the date and method of payment of any duty due</li>
  <li>any adjustments made to the amount of duty due in current or earlier accounting periods (for further information see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect13">section 13</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You should make sure that your duty account is kept fully up to date and a separate duty account must be kept for each scheme you use.</p>

<p>The account must have an audit trail. This means that each entry in the account must be traceable back to the relevant source document. Similarly it must be possible to trace any source document to the relevant entry in the duty account.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Registered Commercial Importers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> What a Registered Commercial Importer is</h3>

<p>A Registered Commercial Importer, legally defined in Northern Ireland HMDP as a Northern Ireland Registered Commercial Importer, is someone who is able to import goods into Northern Ireland that are already duty-paid in an EU member state, and defer payment of the duty using their own or someone else’s duty deferment account. Under this arrangement the duty is guaranteed by the duty deferment guarantee.</p>

<p>Apart from the difference in payment method and the ability to have the goods delivered to other business addresses, the same procedures apply to Registered Commercial Importers as to those traders using the standard duty -paid scheme (see sections 4 to 7).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> How to apply to become a Registered Commercial Importer</h3>

<p>To apply to become a Registered Commercial Importer you must complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-application-to-register-as-a-registered-commercial-importer-hm3">Application to register as a Registered Commercial Importer (HM3)</a> and return it to the address on the form. Further information on the registration and approval process can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect9">section 9</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Requirements you must meet before you can apply to become a Registered Commercial Importer</h3>

<p>To become a Registered Commercial Importer you must:</p>

<ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Who needs to apply for approval</h3>

If you want to receive goods as an Unregistered Commercial Importer using the standard duty -paid scheme, then there is no approval required, although you must still follow the rules as laid down in this notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> Information you must provide in support of your application</h3>

<p>You must provide all the information requested in the application form. You must provide HMRC with details of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your business (including whether you are VAT registered)</li>
  <li>the type or types of goods that you want to be registered to receive</li>
  <li>any current or previous excise authorisations or approvals (including any applications that were refused)</li>
  <li>any unspent convictions under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (<abbr title="Rehabilitation of Offenders Act">ROA</abbr>) (other than for minor motoring offences), or any compounded settlements accepted during the preceding 3 years</li>
  <li>any deferment arrangements that you have in place</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> If you provide false or misleading information</h3>

<p>If you provide false or misleading information on your application form, HMRC may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>revoke any registration or approval which we have granted</li>
  <li>impose penalties</li>
  <li>prosecute you</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span> If your application is rejected</h3>

<p>HMRC may refuse to approve you. In particular, we reserve the right not to approve and register anyone who (at the time of applying) has an ‘unspent’ conviction under <abbr title="Rehabilitation of Offenders Act">ROA</abbr> (other than for minor motoring offences) or has accepted a compounded settlement during the preceding 3 years. In the case of partnerships and limited companies, this also applies to all the partners or key officials of the company.</p>

<p>You should not assume that we will agree to approve you. In particular, you should not place orders or enter into any binding financial agreements on the assumption that we will grant approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span> When your application is accepted</h3>

<p>If HMRC accepts your application we will issue you with a certificate of registration. You should check the accuracy of the details on the certificate which should be kept in a safe place and made available to our officers on request.

<span class="number">9.6 </span> Tell us about business changes</h3>

<p>You must notify us of any changes to the core detail on your certificate of registration, for example, a change of address. If the legal status of your business or company changes, for example, a sole proprietor becomes a partnership, the new legal entity must apply in its own right. We will not automatically approve the new applicant. Where registration is no longer required you must advise us in order that we may cancel your approval (see paragraph 9.10).</p>

<p>You should also tell us when there are significant changes to your corporate structure affecting the day to day running of the business, for example a change of directors.</p>

<p>You must advise the <abbr title="Excise Processing Team">EPT</abbr> in writing within 7 days of the change taking effect. They’ll either provide you with a new certificate or an amendment to your current one, depending on the change.</p>

<p>You must destroy the previous certificate as soon as you receive the replacement certificate.</p>

<p>Failure to advise us of any changes may result in the revocation of your approval.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.10 </span> When we can revoke or vary the terms of your approval</h3>

<p>We can revoke or vary the terms of your approval immediately at any time for reasonable cause. For example, where appropriate due diligence checks are not being carried out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Accounting for duty using deferment arrangements</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Deferment arrangements to account for duty</h3>

<p>Anyone approved as either a Registered Commercial Importer or a tax representative in Northern Ireland can use deferment arrangements to account for the UK duty on duty-paid goods they receive. Anyone using the standard duty -paid scheme may not defer the duty, but must secure it before the goods are dispatched, as described in paragraph 4.6.</p>

<p>Any deferment account used to account for Registered Commercial Importer or tax representative transactions must have a guarantee in place which covers 100 % of the total duty liability.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> Applying for a duty deferment account</h3>

<p>Find more information about how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-which-type-of-account-to-apply-for-to-defer-duty-payments-when-you-import-goods">check which type of account to apply for to defer duty payments when you import goods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> How to get authorisation to use another person’s deferment account</h3>

<p>If you are a Registered Commercial Importer, you must get written authority, on form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-authority-to-use-another-traders-deferment-approval-number-hm8">HM8</a>, from the person whose duty deferment account you want to use. You must send the completed form to the Duty-paid Movements team. Once they’ve received this form, they’ll notify you of the date from which you may use the third party deferment account. You should get confirmation from the duty deferment account holder, that the duty deferment guarantee level is sufficient to cover the duty for the period of use. A separate form must be completed and sent to us for each third party deferment account you want to use.</p>

<p>If you are a tax representative, you may not use another person’s deferment account so must have your own deferment account in place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> If your duty deferment account number changes</h3>

<p>You must tell HMRC if your duty deferment account number changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span> How to account for the duty on consignments received</h3>

<p>At the end of each calendar month accounting period you must calculate the duty due for each tax type and complete the relevant return form with this information. For Registered Commercial Importers this is form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-excise-duty-return-for-registered-consignees-or-registered-commercial-importers-hm2">HM2</a> and for tax representatives it is form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-return-of-excise-duty-for-tax-representatives-hm10">HM10</a>. If you are a Registered Commercial Importer using other people’s deferment accounts, a separate return must be used for each deferment account you intend duty to be paid through. Each return must include all goods on which the duty is being paid using that deferment account. If you are authorised as both a Registered Commercial Importer and a tax representative you must use separate returns for each scheme.</p>

<p>Your return (or returns) must be completed and delivered to the Duty-paid Movements team within 4 consecutive working days (3 if a non-business day intervenes) after the end of the accounting period.</p>

<p>HMRC may allow you to submit plain paper returns as long as they contain the same information as the official return. If you want to submit plain paper returns you should send an example of your proposed document to the Duty-paid Movements team so they can consider your proposal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span> Time limit to how much duty you can declare in each period</h3>

<p>You must declare all duty due within each accounting period, so there is no limit to how much you can declare on each return. However, due to Bacs payment scheme restrictions HMRC can no longer collect direct debits in excess of £20 million. If you have a payment to make which exceeds £20 million, you should make arrangements to pay us, on the due date, by an alternative payment method such as CHAPS.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span> The rate to use</h3>

<p>For Registered Commercial Importers, duty is due on the goods at the rates in force at the time when the goods are received at the Registered Commercial Importer’s registered address.</p>

<p>For tax representatives, duty is due on the goods at the rates in force at the time that the goods are imported. However, if you do not know the time of importation, you may use the rates in force at the time of dispatch.</p>

<p>You can find the current duty rates in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rates-and-allowances-hm-revenue-and-customs">Rates and allowances</a> section on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span> If the duty rate changes during an accounting period</h3>

<p>When you are completing your returns you should check that you are using the correct rate of duty in force at the duty point.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.9 </span> Your accounting period</h3>

<p>You must use calendar monthly accounting periods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.10 </span> If you fail to submit returns on time</h3>

<p>If you fail to submit your returns in time, HMRC may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>impose civil penalties</li>
  <li>revoke your approval</li>
</ul>

<p>If you disagree with our actions, you have the right to appeal. For further information on what you should do if you want to appeal, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect15">section 15</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.11 </span> Nil returns</h3>

<p>Yes. You must submit a return for accounting periods in which your duty liability is ‘nil’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.12 </span> If you find errors in any accounting period</h3>

<p>For all errors on returns submitted, you must make the necessary adjustments clearly in your records by tax type for the current accounting period in a way which makes it easy for us to check. You must draw attention to the adjustment by ticking the relevant box on your next return.</p>

<p>For errors amounting to a total net duty of £2,000 or more, you must also inform the Duty-paid Movements team in writing as soon as the errors are found.</p>

<p>These procedures do not apply where HMRC has begun to examine your accounts for the periods in which the errors were made. Nor do they cover any case where you are aware that an irregularity has occurred which involves a breach of the law.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.13 </span> If you’ve overpaid</h3>

<p>If you’ve overpaid duty to us, those sums must usually be offset against the same tax type code on subsequent declarations made using the same deferment account.</p>

<p>However, if you can justify a request for direct repayment you should complete form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-claim-for-repayment-of-excise-duty-hm6">Claim for repayment of excise duty (HM6)</a> and submit it to the Duty-paid Movements team. HMRC will accept such requests only if we are satisfied that you cannot make the adjustment through your normal systems, for example, if you have an unusually high duty liability for a particular tax type in one particular accounting period. We will only repay the holder of the deferment account which was originally debited.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.14 </span> If we find errors</h3>

<p>If we discover errors we will tell you what you must do. We will also tell you if we decide to impose sanctions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.15 </span> How to pay</h3>

<p>HMRC will check your return and debit the appropriate sums from the relevant deferment account on the next ‘payment day’.</p>

<p>The payment day for both Registered Commercial Importer and tax representative transactions is the 15th of each month following each accounting period (except for beer which is the 25th of each month).</p>

<p>If the payment date falls on a non-banking day (when banks are closed) the payment date is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the last banking day before the 25th of the month for beer</li>
  <li>the first banking day after the 15th of the month for all other goods</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.16 </span> Statements</h3>

<p>Seven days before the payment day we will send each deferment account holder a statement showing the amount being debited.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.17 </span> Queries about your deferment holder’s statement</h3>

<p>If you identify a discrepancy in the statement you should check your records thoroughly and establish it relates to Registered Commercial Importer or tax representative transactions. If it does, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> who will advise on the appropriate action to be taken.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Distance selling</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> What distance selling is</h3>

<p>Distance selling is the sale of excise goods by a vendor in one EU member state to a private individual in a member state. For example, this could be sales over the internet.</p>

<p>It does not apply to sales to Northern Ireland from outside the EU. For information on the rules regarding non-EU sales, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-143-a-guide-for-international-post-users">Notice 143: a guide for international post users</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Requirements for distance sales</h3>

<p>To account for the UK duty on goods sold through a distance sales transaction, you must be authorised as a tax representative in Northern Ireland (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect12">section 12</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Buying goods from a member state, for example, over the internet</h3>

<p>The vendor in the member state of dispatch is responsible for ensuring that the UK duty is paid before they send the goods. However, the vendor is likely to pass on this cost in the purchase price. If the vendor does not make sure that the UK duty is paid, the goods are liable to forfeiture on arrival in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> How to account for the Northern Ireland duty as a vendor in an EU member state</h3>

<p>You must appoint a tax representative in Northern Ireland to account for the duty on your behalf (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect12">section 12</a>). The UK duty must be secured before the goods are dispatched; otherwise the goods are liable to forfeiture on arrival in the Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> How to tell that UK duty has been paid, as a purchaser</h3>

<p>You should expect the price you pay to reflect the payment of UK duty - if the price is very low, it is likely that the vendor does not intend to pay the UK duty. In addition, some websites openly advertise that they’ll misdeclare goods, to try to avoid paying the UK duty. In both of these circumstances, the goods would be liable to forfeiture on arrival in Northern Ireland, so you should be very careful about where you purchase your goods from.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.6 </span> If the UK duty has not been paid before the goods are dispatched</h3>

<p>There is no facility to pay the UK duty due on goods sent from an EU member state when they arrive in the Northern Ireland. If the duty has not been paid before the goods are dispatched, the goods are liable to forfeiture on arrival in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Tax representatives</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> What a tax representative is</h3>

<p>A tax representative, legally defined in Northern Ireland HMDP as a Northern Ireland tax representative, is approved and authorised to account for excise duty on distance sales on behalf of vendors in EU member states.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> How to become a Northern Ireland  tax representative</h3>

<p>You must apply to become a Northern Ireland tax representative by completing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-application-to-be-a-tax-representative-hm9">Application to register as a tax representative (HM9)</a>. You must provide all the information requested on the form. Further information on the registration and approval process can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect9">section 9</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span> How to account for UK duty as a tax representative</h3>

<p>As a tax representative, you should account for the duty using deferment arrangements; therefore you should make sure that you have a deferment account in place before you apply for authorisation as a tax representative. You may not use someone else’s deferment account to account for the duty on distance sales. For more information on accounting for duty using deferment arrangements, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#sect10">section 10</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span> You can only be a tax representative if you are established in Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>To become a tax representative, you must be <a class="govuk-link" href="#gloss">established</a> in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span> Keep a separate duty account and records for any consignments for which you act as a tax representative</h3>

<p>Your duty account should easily identify each distance sale that you accounted for as a tax representative from any other Northern Ireland excise transactions you may have been responsible for. For further information on the type of information that you should record in your duty account, see paragraph 7.4.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> UK duty stamps</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span> Goods that must have a stamp</h3>

<p>All bottles and other retail containers of spirits, and wine or made-wine, with a strength of 30% alcohol by volume or more, with a capacity of 35cl or more, are required to have a duty stamp when removed to home use in the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.2 </span> Different types of duty stamp</h3>

<p>The duty stamp comes in 2 formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a product specific stamp (known as a type A or free-standing stamp) which must be attached directly to the bottle</li>
  <li>a label stamp (referred to in the law as a type B stamp), which is incorporated into bottle labels and printed by the industry’s own label printers</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want label stamps you must be authorised as a Registered Commercial Importer or a tax representative.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.3 </span> When the stamps must be affixed</h3>

<p>If you are receiving unstamped products from the EU through either the standard or Registered Commercial Importer schemes, you must affix stamps within 14 days of the arrival of your goods in Northern Ireland. Alternatively, you can receive goods which already bear either a free-standing or label stamp which has been affixed by a person in a member state.</p>

<p>If you are a tax representative, any product you receive must be stamped before the goods arrive in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>If you are required to and fail to affix stamps within the correct time period the goods are liable to forfeiture. You may also be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of up to £5,000, or a civil penalty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.4 </span> How to get duty stamps</h3>

<p>Unless you are approved as a Registered Commercial Importer or a tax representative, you should request duty stamps from our Commercial Importer team by completing the duty stamps declaration part of form <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-movements-request-to-import-excise-goods-bought-duty-paid-in-another-eu-member-state-hm4">HM4</a>. HMRC will then provide you with free-standing duty stamps for your consignment at the same time as they return your completed form HM4, endorsed with your reference number. We will only supply sufficient stamps for the consignment you are importing.</p>

<p>If you’ve been approved by HMRC as a Registered Commercial Importer or a tax representative, you must apply to become registered to get duty stamps. Once registered, you may acquire free-standing stamps or the design specification for the label stamp.</p>

<p>If you are a tax representative importing distance sales the stamps must be affixed before the goods are dispatched to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>You’ll find more details on the requirements for registration and how to get stamps in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme/excise-notice-ds5-uk-duty-stamps-scheme">Excise Notice DS5: UK Duty Stamps Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.5 </span> Information you’ll need to give on your duty stamp declaration</h3>

<p>You’ll need to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address</li>
  <li>the delivery address for the stamps (this must be the address where you intend affixing the stamps)</li>
  <li>the type of product you are importing, that is, whisky, gin, vodka, rum, brandy, or other product and its alcoholic strength</li>
  <li>the number of bottles you are importing and their size</li>
</ul>

<p>You must also sign a declaration confirming that the goods will not already bear duty stamps when they’re imported.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.6 </span> If you receive goods that already have a stamp</h3>

<p>If the goods you receive already have duty stamps, and you’ve received free-standing stamps from the Duty-paid Movements team for that consignment, you must return them to HMRC. Failure to do so may render you liable to a civil penalty for each stamp that you fail to return.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.7 </span> If you do not have enough free-standing stamps</h3>

<p>If you receive more goods than you ordered, you are required to notify the Duty-paid Movements team. When they’ve received payment of the additional duty due, they’ll provide sufficient additional stamps.</p>

<p>You should note that, where this happens, stamps must still be affixed to the goods within 14 days of their arrival in Northern Ireland. It is therefore in your interests to make sure that HMRC receives payment of any additional duty as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.8 </span> If your stamps are lost, stolen or damaged</h3>

<p>In these circumstances you should inform the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a> by the end of the business day following the day on which the loss or the discovery of the loss occurred. Depending on the circumstances, they’ll then provide you with replacement stamps.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.9 </span> If you do not have the correct stamps for the goods you receive</h3>

<p>In these circumstances you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#movements">Duty-paid Movements team</a>. They’ll then advise you of the correct action to take.</p>

<p>Normally HMRC will require you to return the incorrect stamps and reissue you with appropriate replacements. However, you must also confirm that the Alcohol By Volume (<abbr title="alcohol by volume">ABV</abbr>) and volume of the product are identical to the detail originally notified to us. If they’re not, then you must also arrange for any outstanding duties to be paid before we will provide replacement stamps.</p>

<p>While our officers are on your premises you must make sure their safety at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.4 </span> What to expect</h3>

<p>We will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify ourselves by name on arrival, and produce an identity card</li>
  <li>explain the main purpose of the visit</li>
  <li>be polite and considerate and deal with your tax affairs confidentially</li>
  <li>keep claims on your and your staff’s time to a minimum</li>
  <li>where possible, try to resolve matters during the visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.5 </span> How you can help</h3>

<p>You can help by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advising us as soon as possible about the reasons for any significant changes in the tax or duties you’ve declared or the systems used to calculate the declarations. You should do this by contacting our Duty-paid Movements team</li>
  <li>keeping your records, declarations and payments up to date</li>
  <li>providing us with the information and explanations we request</li>
  <li>asking us if you are unsure of any matter connected with the duty or tax. We may not look at all aspects of your records and business, so you cannot assume that you are accounting for everything correctly just because no errors are found - so it is in your own interest to ask if you are unsure</li>
  <li>helping us to understand your business and records</li>
  <li>replying to enquiries within the specified time</li>
  <li>quoting your reference number when you contact us</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">14.6 </span> If you disagree with a decision</h3>

<p>If you disagree with a decision, discuss it first with the visiting officer.</p>

<p>If you still disagree, then you should read section 15 Review and appeals process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Review and appeals process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> What if I disagree with an HMRC decision</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against we will tell you and offer you a review. We will explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree.</p>

<p>For example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a civil penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to duty-paid movements</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you’ve been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Time limits</h3>

<p>If you want HMRC to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter, within 30 days of the date of that letter.</p>

<p>We will complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until the 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we have told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we will ask you whether you are willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld.</p>

<p>We will write to tell you this and, you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> What to include in your request for a review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with HMRC and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> If you do not want a review</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the Tribunals Service within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Examples of duty calculation</h2>

<p>Unless HMRC has approved the use of an alternative method of calculating the duty that does not disadvantage the revenue, you must work out each constituent stage of the calculation process to a minimum of 4 decimal places.</p>

<p>The amount of duty due should be rounded down to 2 decimal places (for example, £2,957.3532 should be expressed as £2,957.35).</p>

<p>The following examples may assist you in calculating Excise duty. The rates used are only examples and are not the current duty rates.</p>

<p>Current rates of excise duty for all excise goods can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rates-and-allowances-hm-revenue-and-customs">Rates and allowances</a> 
 section of GOV.UK, or in Part 12, Volume 1 of the Tariff.</p>

<h3>Wines and cider</h3>

<p>Excise duty on wine and cider is charged on the total hectolitres of product. It is charged in bandings, according to the strength of the product (its abv) and whether it is still or sparkling. It is calculated by converting the bulk litres of product into hectolitres and then applying the current rate of excise duty.</p>

<p>To find the excise duty on a case of still wine containing 12 bottles of 75cl at 7% abv:</p>

<ul>
  <li>convert the total volume to bulk hectolitres (hl). This is done by multiplying the number of bottles by their volume in litres and then multiplying that figure by the number of cases. This gives you the bulk volume in litres, therefore you need to divide this figure by 100 to convert it into hectolitres. In this case you get: 12 x 0.75 / 100 = 0.09 hl.</li>
  <li>the duty rate for the product is then applied to the bulk volume calculated</li>
  <li>multiply the bulk hectolitres by the current rate of duty for the relevant product and duty banding. For the purposes of this calculation we will use a rate of £214.02 per hl.</li>
  <li>therefore the duty on the case in this example is: 0.09hl x £214.02 = £19.26</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beer</h3>

<p>Beer Duty is charged on the hectolitre % of alcohol in the beer. It is calculated by converting the bulk litres of beer into hectolitres and multiplying by the alcohol by volume (abv) figure declared. The current excise duty rate is then applied to this figure. There are 3 main types of Beer Duty:</p>

<ol>
  <li>General Beer Duty (<abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr>). The standard rate of <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> applies to all beer with an abv exceeding 2.8% but not exceeding 7.5%.</li>
</ol>

<p>To find the excise duty on 327 cases of beer each containing 24 bottles of 33cl at 5% abv:</p>

<ul>
  <li>convert the total volume to bulk hectolitres. This is done by multiplying the number of bottles by their volume in litres and then multiplying that figure by the number of cases. This gives you the bulk volume in litres, therefore you need to divide this figure by 100 to convert it into hectolitres. In this case you get: 24 x 0.33 x 327 / 100 = 25.8984 hl</li>
  <li>the bulk hectolitre figure is then multiplied by the declared abv amount: 25.8984 x 5 = 129.492 hl %</li>
  <li>multiply the hl % amount by the <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> rate. For the purposes of this calculation we will use a rate of £18.57</li>
  <li>therefore the duty on 327 cases in this example is: £18.57 x 129.49 = £2,404.62</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>High Strength Beer Duty (<abbr title="High Strength Beer Duty">HSBD</abbr>) is payable on beer exceeding 7.5% abv. It is payable in addition to <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr>. For the purposes of the calculation below we have used a <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> rate of £18.57 (as in the previous example) and a <abbr title="High Strength Beer Duty">HSBD</abbr> rate of £4.64 (25% of the General Beer Duty rate).</li>
</ol>

<p>To find the total excise duty on 450 cases of beer each containing 24 bottles of 27.5cl at 8% abv:</p>

<p>First work out the hl % of alcohol in the consignment (as shown in the previous example):</p>

<p>24 x 0.275 = 6.6 litres per case<br>6.6 x 450 = 2,970 litres in total<br>2,970 / 100 = 29.7 hl in total<br>29.7 x 8 = 237.6 hl % 
Then multiply this amount by both the <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> and <abbr title="High Strength Beer Duty">HSBD</abbr> rates:</p>

<p>237.6 x <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> rate of £18.57 = £4,412.232, truncated to £4,412.23237.6 x <abbr title="High Strength Beer Duty">HSBD</abbr> rate of £4.64 = £1,102.464, truncated to £1,102.46</p>

<p>Total duty payable</p>

<p><abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> + <abbr title="High Strength Beer Duty">HSBD</abbr> = £4,412.23 + £1,102.46 = £5,514.69</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is also a reduced rate of general beer duty for lower strength beer (that is, beer exceeding 1.2% abv but not exceeding 2.8% abv). For the purposes of the calculation below we have used a <abbr title="General Beer Duty">GBD</abbr> rate of £18.57 (as in the previous examples) and a reduced rate of £9.29 (50% of the General Beer Duty rate)</li>
</ol>

<p>To find out the total excise duty on 375 cases of beer each containing 24 bottles of 27.5cl at 2.8% abv:</p>

<p>First work out the hl % of alcohol in the consignment (as shown in the previous examples)</p>

<p>24 x 0.275 = 6.6 litres<br>6.6 x 450 = 2,970 litres in total<br>2,970 / 100 = 24.75 hl in total<br>24.75 x 2.8 = 69.3 hl % 
To calculate the actual duty due, multiply the hl %amount by the duty rate</p>

<p>69.3 x £9.29 = £643.797, truncated to £643.79.</p>

<p>Beer that qualifies for small brewery relief is eligible for different reduced rates of duty. For further information on how to calculate the duty on small brewery beer please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-226-beer-duty">Excise Notice 226: Beer Duty</a>.</p>

<h3>Spirits</h3>

<p>Duty is charged on the alcohol content of the spirit (that is, the litres of pure alcohol). This is calculated by multiplying the bulk litres by the alcoholic strength (abv). The excise duty is then obtained by multiplying this amount by the spirit duty rate.</p>

<p>To calculate the excise duty on 79 cases of 43% whisky each containing 12 x 70cl.</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate the volume per case by multiplying the number of bottles per case by their volume in litres: 12 x 0.70 = 8.4 litres</li>
  <li>the alcohol volume per case is then calculated by multiplying the total volume per case by the abv expressed as a decimal: 8.4 x 0.43 = 3.612 litres of alcohol</li>
  <li>the total alcohol volume for the consignment is obtained by multiplying by the number of cases: 3.612 x 79 = 285.348 litres of alcohol</li>
  <li>multiply the total litres of alcohol by the spirits duty rate. For the purposes of this calculation we will use a rate of £22.64 per litre of alcohol</li>
  <li>therefore the duty on 79 cases in this example is: 285.34 x £22.64 = £6,460.09</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span> The due diligence condition</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.1 </span> What due diligence is</h3>

<p>Due diligence is the appropriate reasonable care a company exercises when entering into business relations or contracts with other companies, and how it responds in a deliberate reflexive manner to trading risks identified.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.2 </span> Why is a due diligence condition required?</h3>

<p>Without effective safeguards in place, there are considerable risks to all businesses along alcohol supply chains of becoming implicated in illicit trading.</p>

<p>This condition requires that all excise registered businesses operating in the alcohol sector consider the risk of excise duty evasion as well as any commercial and other risks when they’re trading. Doing so will help to drive illicit trading out of alcohol supply chains, and reduce the risk to businesses of financial liabilities associated with goods on which duty has been evaded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.3 </span> What is expected of you</h3>

<p>It is   a condition of your approval as a Registered Commercial Importer or tax representative that you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>objectively assess the risks of alcohol duty fraud within the supply chains in which you operate</li>
  <li>put in place reasonable and proportionate checks, in your day to day trading, to identify transactions that may lead to fraud or involve goods on which duty may have been evaded</li>
  <li>have procedures in place to take timely and effective mitigating action where a risk of fraud is identified</li>
  <li>document the checks you intend to carry out and have appropriate management governance in place to make sure that these are, and continue to be, carried out as intended</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.4 </span> How to assess the risks in my supply chains</h3>

<p>The fraud risks within a supply chain are unique to each business, and objective assessment of the likelihood of your trading activities contributing to fraud is an essential first step to developing effective due diligence procedures. You’ll need to consider the full range of trading relationships you’ve established and the potential for fraud in each.</p>

<p>The main risks within the alcohol sector include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>involvement in the supply of goods for fraud</li>
  <li>receiving goods that have been smuggled or diverted into the UKNorthern Ireland</li>
  <li>inadvertently facilitating fraud by providing import or warehousing services</li>
</ul>

<p>A key feature of the smuggling or diversion of alcohol to the UK Northern Ireland market is the ability to source product either where the excise duty has been suspended or it has been refunded under drawback provisions. To assess your exposure to this risk you’ll need to objectively assess if there is potential for duty evasion resulting from your trading activity. You’ll need to know who you are selling to and where the goods are destined for and understand the market for these products. Without this, there is a risk of supplying goods directly or through a third party into illicit supply chains.</p>

<p>Import and warehousing procedures are often exploited to provide cover for the illicit movement of goods. Fraudsters will seek to distribute duty evaded goods as well as counterfeit alcohol into legitimate retail supply chains. To assess your exposure to this risk you’ll need to objectively consider whether the supply chain and trading activity is credible which includes knowing who you source goods from and provide a service to.</p>

<p>High level indicators of risk include goods being received from unusually complex or apparently uneconomic supply routes, for example, regular supplies of UK produced goods that have been shipped out to a member state and then re-imported. If you are sourcing duty-paid goods you’ll also need to consider the credibility of suppliers and the level of evidence you can get to demonstrate the provenance and duty status of goods.</p>

<p>Paragraph 19.9 of this notice provides further detail on risk indicators.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.5 </span> Checks to carry out</h3>

<p>Once you’ve established the main risks of fraud you may be exposed to, your regular checks during trading should be of a type and level sufficient to establish the integrity of the excise transactions and supply chains you are trading in. This level needs to be reasonable and proportionate to the risk.</p>

<p>Depending on the nature of your business and complexity of your transactions, checks will need to be individually tailored. In particular, they must be sufficiently sensitive, yet robust enough, to pick up potential fraud risks. These checks should provide protection from the threat of fraud or you becoming inadvertently involved in fraudulent activity.</p>

<p>As a general rule ‘FITTED’ checks should normally focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>financial health of the company you intend trading with</li>
  <li>identity of the business you intend trading with</li>
  <li>terms of any contracts, payment and credit agreements</li>
  <li>transport details of the movement of the goods involved whether or not you are directly involved in this</li>
  <li>existence/Provenance of goods - where goods are said to be duty-paid you should normally seek sufficient detail to satisfy yourself of the status of the goods</li>
  <li>the Deal, understanding the nature of the transaction itself, including:
    <ul>
      <li>how the cost of the goods is built up, for example, whether it includes appropriate taxes, transport etc</li>
      <li>why is it being offered</li>
      <li>whether it is too good to be true</li>
      <li>how the deal compares to the market generally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Paragraph 19.10 of this notice provides more examples.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.6 </span> How to respond to a fraud risk in your supply chains</h3>

<p>It is expected that your due diligence procedures will provide effective control over the risks of fraud within your supply chains. Where your checks indicated real concerns, we would normally expect aspects of your supply chain to be changed to address this, for example, the supplier or the destination of the goods. However, a decision of whether or not to trade with another party remains a commercial decision for your business to take.</p>

<p>If your checks lead you to suspect duty fraud you should also inform our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-excise-and-vat-fraud-reporting">Customs Hotline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.7 </span> HMRC reviews</h3>

<p>As part of our enforcement and general audit programmes, we will consider whether or not the steps you’ve taken to embed anti-fraud due diligence into your trading activity are sufficient and timely to address fraud risks in your supply chains. We will aim to establish whether you have objectively assessed the risks in your supply chain, and you must be able to demonstrate that you have put in place reasonable and proportionate checks and effective procedures to respond to fraud risks when they arise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.8 </span> If your due diligence checks are found to be insufficient</h3>

<p>If your due diligence procedures are considered insufficient to address fraud risks, we will carefully consider the facts of the case before taking further action, but where appropriate we will seek to support you to strengthen your procedures.</p>

<p>In more serious cases such as a failure to consider the risks, undertake due diligence checks or respond to clear indications of fraud, we will apply appropriate and proportionate sanctions. For serious non compliance, such as ignoring warnings or knowingly entering into high risk transactions, we may revoke excise approvals and licences.</p>

<p>You are also reminded that handling goods liable to excise duty held outside a duty- suspension arrangement may cause you to become liable for any excise duty due on those goods and an excise wrongdoing penalty. Any of those goods you currently hold could also be liable to forfeiture.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 19.9 and 19.10 of this notice provide further details on risk indicators and outline some of the checks that you may carry out to identify high risk transactions. These are not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive.</p>

<p>Once you’ve established the most appropriate due diligence tests for your business, these should be used to test both new and existing transactions and supply chains linked to your business. Some checks may be more appropriate to your business than others.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.9 </span> Examples of due diligence risk indicators</h3>

<p>You should be concerned about a prospective transaction where you identify one or more of the following indicators in both suppliers and customers, the presence of which may lead you to make further inquiries. This list is not exhaustive.</p>

<h4>Financial health of the company you intend trading with</h4>

<ul>
  <li>there is no, or poor, credit ratings but it is still able to finance substantial deals</li>
  <li>there are high levels of debt</li>
  <li>they’re buying high value goods on extended credit</li>
  <li>they’re a new company with little or no trading history</li>
  <li>there are little or no fixed assets</li>
</ul>

<h4>Identity of the business</h4>

<ul>
  <li>there is a lack of detail about the business’ identity, for example, no address details, or HMRC approval number</li>
  <li>they do not appear to be on Companies House records as originally described</li>
  <li>they’re dealing in high value goods from short term lease accommodation or residential addresses</li>
  <li>there is no general visibility of the company you intend trading with, for example, they do not appear to advertise or have a website</li>
  <li>they’ve returned only partly completed application or trading forms</li>
  <li>if you are a warehousekeeper, receiving duty suspension goods on behalf of a third party who is not WOWGR registered where they would otherwise be required to be registered</li>
</ul>

<h4>Terms of contract, payment and credit agreements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>an insistence on dealing in cash, especially where the deal is a high value one</li>
  <li>cash payments made using money couriers</li>
  <li>offers of credit appear to be outside normal business practice. Payment terms are normally 21, 31 or 45 days but high-risk transactions may have short payment terms, for example, 48 hours</li>
  <li>you are asked to make payment to an account or person which does not appear to be linked to the seller, or other unusual payment arrangements requested by the seller. The same applies to customers</li>
  <li>a valid pro-forma or purchase invoice is not or will not be provided</li>
  <li>the circumstances of the trading arrangement seem false or contrived. For example, a supplier provides you with the details of a customer for the goods he is selling to you, or offers you a contract with no financial loss to you</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<p>The goods are to be received from an unusual source or supply route, for example, UK produced goods are sourced from another country and directly compete with those from a more direct supply route.</p>

<h4>Existence or provenance of goods</h4>

<ul>
  <li>the goods are claimed to be duty-paid but your supplier (or person on whose behalf you are storing the goods) cannot provide reasonable evidence of duty payment to support the status of the goods.(For further detail about what constitutes evidence of duty payment please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-207-excise-duty-drawback">Excise Notice 207: excise duty drawback</a>)</li>
  <li>individuals in the company have little knowledge of your trade sector</li>
  <li>where samples are provided or the goods have been received
    <ul>
      <li>for spirits there is no duty stamp in circumstances where there should be one or the duty stamp does not fluoresce (refer to guidance)</li>
      <li>the goods appear counterfeit, in that, the quality of labels and or packaging is poor when compared to the genuine article</li>
      <li>the supporting paperwork seems false</li>
      <li>the goods are older than supporting evidence (such as documents demonstrating duty payment) suggest, for example, the best before dates indicate an earlier production date whereas documentation gives the impression you were buying newer stock</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the company has only been trading for a very short period of time but has managed to achieve a large income in that short period of time</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Deal</h4>

<ul>
  <li>customer demand for specific brands in other countries exceeds expected levels of consumption there</li>
  <li>the goods are to be moved in an unusual supply route that in itself would add significant logistic costs and bring into question the economics of that trade (unless duty was to be evaded)</li>
  <li>supplies are offered through unsolicited emails or flyers received out of the blue</li>
  <li>goods are offered at incredibly low prices which seem too good to be true</li>
  <li>free gifts of similar or other excise goods not fully documented and in themselves would place a question over the deal as a whole</li>
  <li>there are other incentives such as contingency discounts which overall make the deal sound too good to be true</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">19.10 </span> Examples of due diligence checks</h3>

<h4>Financial health</h4>

<ul>
  <li>obtain, undertake credit checks or other background checks on the business you intend trading with</li>
  <li>where a poor credit rating is identified, establish how the transactions will be funded, what security can be offered that you’ll be paid</li>
  <li>where credit is offered by the business, who is providing the credit facility</li>
  <li>what payment terms are offered and are they commercially viable</li>
</ul>

<h4>Identity</h4>

<ul>
  <li>check company details provided to you against other sources, for example website, letterheads, telephone directories</li>
  <li>ask whether your customer or supplier is a member of a relevant trade association</li>
  <li>get copies of certificates of incorporation, VAT registration certificates and excise registration certificates where appropriate and where a trade class is quoted on these, check whether or not it relates to the type of trade you are engaging in</li>
  <li>verify VAT and excise registration details with HMRC (we recommend that these checks are undertaken regularly for new trading arrangements and proportionately longer for trusted ones, unless you suspect a problem)</li>
  <li>if you are a warehousekeeper receiving duty- suspended goods into your warehouse then you should be satisfied that the owner of the goods is registered under WOWGR where required</li>
  <li>get signed letters of introduction on headed letter paper and references from other customers or suppliers</li>
  <li>insist on personal contact with a senior official of the prospective supplier and where necessary, make an initial visit to their premises. You should use this opportunity to confirm the identity of the person you intend doing business with and keep a record of your meeting</li>
  <li>establish what your customer’s or supplier’s history in the trade is. Can this be evidenced?</li>
  <li>get the prospective customer’s or supplier’s bank details. In the case of an import or export, does the supplier or recipient share the same country of residence as their bank?</li>
  <li>establish who you’ll be paying. Is this the same company as the one you are directly dealing with?</li>
  <li>if you are providing a service who will be paying for it?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Terms of any contracts, payments and credit agreements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>carefully consider the terms of any contracts and credit agreements before entering into these and challenge elements which appear unusual</li>

      <li>how competitive is the broker’s pricing to those from a more direct route?</li>

    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<h4>Transport</h4>

<ul>
  <li>establish where the goods will be sourced from. Is this the country of production? If not why are the goods being routed in this way?</li>
  <li>who is responsible for the transport? Is the cost of the goods inclusive of transport? If so, does this mean that the potential logistical costs make the unit price unrealistic?</li>

  <li>are they in good condition and not damaged?</li>
  <li>do the quantities on offer seem credible for the type of business you intend trading with?</li>
  <li>where goods are said to be duty-paid, seek sufficient detail to satisfy yourself that they are, this will be easier the closer you are in the supply chain to production, this point is also important where you intend holding goods on behalf of a third party</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Deal</h4>

<ul>
  <li>the nature of the transaction, including
    <ul>
      <li>does it just look too good to be true?</li>
      <li>is the demand for the type of alcohol credible? If the demand is purportedly from abroad what is the real market (consumption) for them in that country?</li>
      <li>if the alcohol has come from abroad but is of UK origin, how did this occur and why?</li>
      <li>where incentives are offered, when these are taken into consideration does this make the overall deal seem too good to be true?</li>
      <li>why is it being offered?</li>
      <li>have normal commercial practices been adopted in negotiating prices?</li>
      <li>how does the price compete with that offered by competitors?</li>
      <li>what is the age of the goods? If the stock is old you should seek an explanation as to its provenance</li>
      <li>does the price seem realistic? You should be aware of unit cost when duty and VAT values are removed</li>
      <li>if you are already established in a trading agreement we would also recommend that you continue to monitor correspondence and business paperwork to identify changes in those arrangements and take any follow up action as necessary</li>
