<p>Walking and cycling are the least carbon-intensive ways to travel.</p>

<p>However, walking currently accounts for only 4% of the total distance travelled by households with access to a car. Journeys under 2 miles made up around 45% of all urban trips in England, in 2019, and journeys below 5 miles made up 58% of all car trips.</p>

<p>Many of these trips could be walked or cycled, which would help to reduce the 68 metric tons (<abbr title="metric ton">Mt</abbr>) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emitted from cars in 2019. This would benefit local economies, as well as improve people’s health.</p>

<p>More active travel will also make roads quieter, safer and more attractive for people to walk and cycle – a virtuous cycle.</p>

<p>As we decarbonise transport, making all cars, public transport and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) zero emission is part of the solution, but relying solely on zero emission road vehicles isn’t enough.</p>

<p>Road traffic, even on pre-COVID-19 trends, was predicted to grow by 22% from 2015 to 2035, much of it in cities where building new roads is physically difficult and disadvantages communities.</p>

<p>To help avoid a car-led recovery from the pandemic, the government wants walking, cycling or public transport to be the natural first choice for journeys.</p>

<p>Local authorities can play an important role in increasing walking and cycling. Through influencing planning and taking a wider, strategic view of travel infrastructure across their area, authorities can ensure that active travel infrastructure connects residents to services.</p>

<p>As local leaders, authorities have a wide sphere of influence and can lead by example in adopting, promoting and providing infrastructure to enable and encourage active travel with their staff.</p>

<p>Authorities can also work with local businesses, industrial estates and business improvement districts to design specific interventions and behaviour change programmes to enable active travel with their employees and customers.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The primary actions for local authorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs)</li>
  <li>develop and implement Travel Demand Management Plans</li>
  <li>plan for and improve active travel infrastructure</li>
  <li>promote behaviour change to enable active travel</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>What active travel means</h2>

<p>Active travel refers to modes of travel that involve a level of activity.</p>

<p>The term is often used interchangeably with walking and cycling, but active travel can also include trips made by wheelchair, mobility scooters, adapted cycles, e-cycles, scooters, as well as cycle sharing schemes (adapted from the definition in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-mobility-urban-strategy">Future of Mobility: urban strategy</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://wheelsforwellbeing.org.uk/types-of-cycles/" rel="external">Wheels for Wellbeing</a> explains that cycling includes a wide range of cycle types, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bicycles</li>
  <li>handcycles</li>
  <li>tricycles</li>
  <li>recumbent tricycles</li>
  <li>go-karts</li>
  <li>cycles for 2 (tandem, side by side, wheelchair tandem and duet bikes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent changes in active travel</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2020">2020 National Travel Survey</a> found that while the number of walking trips decreased during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average number of miles walked increased to its highest level – 220 miles a year – in 18 years. The number of people walking over 1 mile on average increased in 2020 by 34% from 2019.</p>

<p>Cycling also increased to its highest level in 2020. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/walking-and-cycling-statistics-england-2020/walking-and-cycling-statistics-england-2020#factors-influencing-cycling-rates">National Travel Survey</a> reported that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>47% of people over 5 years had access to a bike, up from a 3-year average of 42%</li>
  <li>more people (an increase of 23%) cycled for part of their trip, and the average number of trips by bike increased by 26%</li>
  <li>average miles cycled per person increased by 62% (from 54 to 88 miles) – over double the average of 39 miles in 2002.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wave 5 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-attitudes-study-wave-5/national-travel-attitudes-study-wave-5">National Travel Attitude Survey</a> focused on cycling with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>segregated cycle paths (55%), safer (53%) and well-maintained surfaces (49%) the most common measures that respondents said would encourage them to cycle more</li>
  <li>64% supporting the creation of dedicated cycle lanes, at the expense of road space for cars</li>
</ul>

<h3>E-cycles</h3>

<p>E-cycles are growing in popularity and make cycling accessible to more people, build users’ confidence and enable cycling in more challenging terrain.</p>

<p>The definition of e-cycle includes all electrically assisted pedal cycles, electric cycles, e-bikes and e-trikes.</p>

<p>E-cycles offer assistance only when the rider is pedalling and must comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs/electrically-assisted-pedal-cycles-eapcs-in-great-britain-information-sheet">electrically assisted pedal cycles (EAPCs) regulations</a>.</p>

<p>To be classified as an <abbr title="electrically assisted pedal cycles">EAPC</abbr> and not treated as a motor vehicle, when used on roads, a cycle fitted with an electric motor must comply with the requirements of the <abbr title="electrically assisted pedal cycles">EAPC</abbr> Regulations 1983. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it must be fitted with pedals that are capable of propelling it</li>
  <li>the maximum continuous rated power of the electric motor must not exceed 250 watts</li>
  <li>electrical assistance must cut off when the vehicle reaches 15.5 miles an hour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cycle sharing</h3>

<p>Cycle sharing describes any setting where bikes can be borrowed by the public or an employee (for workplace schemes).</p>

<p>CoMoUK offers more <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-bikes/how/" rel="external">information and guidance on cycle sharing schemes</a> and identifies different scheme types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public – growing rapidly, these can include e-cycles. They integrate well with other modes of transport and are established in Belfast, Brighton, Cardiff, Glasgow, Liverpool and London</li>
  <li>station-based – bikes are located at train stations and at various points across the town or city, at staffed or unstaffed hubs, docking stations or in a geo-fenced area. Some can be returned to any dock and others must be returned to the starting location</li>
  <li>free-floating – where bikes can be left anywhere within the urban boundary, often with guidance on not causing obstructions when parking</li>
  <li>bike libraries – allow users to rent bikes for short periods and include bike hubs in community locations (such as libraries and sports centres)</li>
  <li>peer-to-peer – where owners rent their bike out for a fee</li>
  <li>pool bikes – generally housed at workplaces or community locations and borrowed by members of staff or the community. These schemes may share public facilities such as cycle storage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementing active travel: bikes sharing in Scotland</h4>

<p>In 2020, the grant programme Paths for All, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pathsforall.org.uk/smarter-choices-smarter-places-1" rel="external">Smarter Choices, Smarter Places</a>, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, worked to increase the uptake of bike-sharing. This generated almost 18,000 new users and a 38% increase in trips in 3 months.</p>

<p>Users reported an improvement in their physical and mental health, and 10% went on to buy their own bike. Further details are available from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/free-rides-report/" rel="external">CoMoUK</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>The benefits of active travel</h2>

<p>Encouraging mode shift to walking and cycling is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing transport emissions, as outlined in the transport decarbonisation plan.</p>

<p>Walking and cycling can decrease congestion, air and noise pollution, and both are linked to health and economic benefits.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk/insight/segregated-cycleways-and-e-bikes-future-urban-travel" rel="external">Friends of the Earth</a> produced a briefing on the role and benefits of segregated cycleways and e-cycles in urban areas. They report that improvements could deliver benefits for health, carbon and local economies, and make recommendations to maximise the effectiveness of funding.</p>

<h3>Carbon emissions and air pollution</h3>

<p>Sustrans, the national travel charity, estimates that 28,000 to 36,000 early deaths occur each year in the UK due to air pollution worsening heart and lung disease. They report that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/policy-positions/all/all/our-position-on-improving-air-quality/" rel="external">80% of roadside nitrogen dioxide (<abbr title="nitrogen dioxide">NO2</abbr>) pollution</a> is from road transport where limits are being broken.</p>

<p>As more of our short journeys (43% of all urban and town journeys are under 2 miles) are cycled or walked, the carbon, air quality, noise and congestion benefits will be complemented by significant improvements in public health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>It is estimated that active travel can deliver between 1 MtCO2e  and 6 MtCO2e savings from 2020 to 2050 in the transport decarbonisation plan.</p>

<p>Active travel can reduce the proportion of people driving children to school by up to 33%. Through projects such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ibike.sustrans.org.uk/resources/the-big-pedal/" rel="external">Big Pedal</a>, 8.5 million car miles could be saved, resulting in a decrease of 2,500 <abbr title="tons of carbon dioxide equivalent">tCO2e</abbr> and reductions in <abbr title="nitrogen dioxide">NO2</abbr> levels.</p>

<p>Future active travel spending is expected to deliver £20 million to £100 million savings from air quality improvements as well as providing opportunities to improve green space and biodiversity.</p>

<h3>Physical health</h3>

<p>Physical inactivity costs the NHS up to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-case-for-active-travel-the-health-benefits">£1 billion each year</a>, with additional indirect costs of £8.2 billion according to a report by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) in 2014 on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-case-for-active-travel-the-health-benefits">the economic benefits of walking and cycling</a>. This report also highlights a link between adult obesity levels and travel behaviour as countries with the highest levels of cycling and walking generally have the lowest obesity rates.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/decarbonising-transport-growing-cycle-use" rel="external">Growing Cycle Use</a>, the Local Government Association (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>) reports that if cycling rates were elevated to London levels across other UK cities, this would avoid at least 34,000 incidences of 8 life-threatening conditions between 2017 and 2040.</p>

<p>Regular commuting by bike is linked to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-mobility-urban-strategy">lower risk of cancer or heart disease</a> compared to other forms of transport. This may be partly due to cyclists and walkers being exposed to less air pollution than drivers and passengers inside vehicles on the same routes.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/walking-or-cycling-to-work-is-great-for-your-health/" rel="external">Sustrans</a> identifies further health benefits: a 3-mile commute will achieve recommended levels of activity each week.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/active-travel-benefits-walking-and-cycling/" rel="external">Energy Saving Trust</a> reports that walking strengthens muscles, lungs, bones and joints.</p>

<p>Physical activity has also been shown to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/health-benefits-of-cycling-and-walking/" rel="external">reduce incidences of heart disease, asthma, diabetes and cancer</a>, as well as benefiting those with bad backs.</p>

<h3>Mental health</h3>

<p>Exercise can protect against anxiety and depression, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-health-benefits" rel="external">according to the NHS</a>. Any exercise is beneficial but exercising outdoors can have additional benefits.</p>

<p>Research in the British Medical Journal suggests that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e013542" rel="external">exercise can also help reduce stress</a>. Guidance from the UK Chief Medical Officers’ on physical activity suggests that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-guidelines-uk-chief-medical-officers-report">30 minutes of moderate activity per day almost halve the odds of experiencing depression</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-plan-for-england">Gear Change</a> states that completing 20 minutes of exercise each day cuts the risk of depression by 31% and increases worker productivity.</p>

<h3>Economic benefits</h3>

<p>Increasing active travel will reduce road congestion, particularly at peak times, leading to increased productivity and improved movement of goods and services. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/the-benefits-of-being-a-cycle-friendly-employer" rel="external">Sustrans estimates</a> that congestion costs £10 billion per year in 2009 in urban areas, and that this cost could rise to £22 billion by 2025.</p>

<p>Well-planned walking improvements can lead to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justeconomics.co.uk/education-employment-and-economic-development/the-pedestrian-pound" rel="external">40% increase</a> in shopping footfall.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> highlights how, after a Canadian <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/decarbonising-transport-growing-cycle-use" rel="external">council reallocated high street parking as bike lanes or cycle parking for a year, businesses benefitted</a> from increased footfall (20% increase), spend (16% increase) and increased frequency of return visits (13% increase).</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan">Transport decarbonisation plan</a> states that bike manufacture, distribution, retail and sales contribute £0.8 billion per year to the economy and support around 22,000 jobs.</p>

<h3>For organisations</h3>

<p>As an employer, promoting active travel can help with corporate social responsibility, reduce the impact of business traffic (including commuting) locally and reduce demand for parking spaces.</p>

<p>Active travel can also improve the health and wellbeing of staff, increase productivity and motivation, and aid the recruitment and retention of skilled workers. More information is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/the-benefits-of-being-a-cycle-friendly-employer/" rel="external">Sustrans website</a>.</p>

<h2>Actions for local authorities</h2>

<p>Local authorities are well placed to plan and provide space for inclusive active travel infrastructure and accompanying behavioural change programmes. For Local Transport Authorities (LTAs) and combined authorities, doing so is part of their responsibilities on highways and road safety.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>, as part of their decarbonising transport series, produced guidance on how authorities can grow cycle use. They note that measures will be most effective if implemented as part of a comprehensive active travel plan, integrated with wider transport, climate and housing strategies.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-city-ambition-programme-2013-to-2018-review">final evaluation report of the Cycle City Ambition programme</a> makes suggestions for local policymakers and practitioners on the most effective ways to increase active travel. It found that improving infrastructure is effective in increasing cycling and improving health equity, but requires significant investment and may take some time for impacts to be fully realised.</p>

<p>Sustrans can assist local authorities to develop active travel policy and guidance. It can also help promote active travel and provide feedback on walking and cycling schemes. Its website has sections for professionals, policy, and a resource library to enable authorities to make the case for active travel.</p>

<p>Wheels for Wellbeing is a national charity that supports disabled people to access and enjoy cycling. As part of its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wheelsforwellbeing.org.uk/campaigning/infrastructure-for-all/" rel="external">Infrastructure for All campaign</a>, it has highlighted the most significant barriers to cycling for disabled cyclists, including inaccessible cycling infrastructure and inadequate facilities to secure adapted cycles.</p>

<p>It recommends that authorities looking to install or upgrade cycling infrastructure follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk/dmrb/search/4b59ebc3-065b-467f-8b43-09d2802f91c8" rel="external">CD195 guidance</a> on designing for cycle traffic from Highways England, or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/streets-toolkit" rel="external">London Cycling Design Standards</a> inclusive cycle concept.</p>

<p>Wheels for Wellbeing has published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wheelsforwellbeing.org.uk/campaigning/guide/" rel="external">Guide to Inclusive Cycling</a> that promotes best practice in designing inclusive cycling infrastructure.</p>

<h4>Implementing active travel: Greater Manchester</h4>

<p>Using funding from the Cycle Cities Ambition programme, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/building-cycle-infrastructure-in-manchester">Greater Manchester built 3 miles of cycle lanes along one of the city’s busiest bus routes in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Infrastructure installed included a mix of on-road and fully segregated cycle lanes and shared-use paths, along with 26 bus stop bypass lanes for cyclists.</p>

<p>The cycling measures were planned as part of a holistic design to improve the environment and maximise opportunities for cycling, walking and improved bus travel along the corridor.</p>

<p>The overall scheme included widened footways and improved crossing facilities for pedestrians and the removal of general traffic from a section of the road at certain times of day, improving bus journey time reliability. Mitigation measures to address traffic displacement onto parallel routes were also introduced.</p>

<p>Surveys found that in 2018, cycling 2 miles from the city centre was up 85% against a 2015 baseline.</p>

<p>For 2018, analysis identified more than a million journeys along one section of the route, saving an estimated 873.5 tonnes of CO2.</p>

<p>Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plans (LCWIPs) are part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy">2017 cycling and walking investment strategy</a>.</p>

<p>Although not mandatory, their aim is to help authorities in England take a strategic approach to improving conditions for walking and cycling and ensure that consideration is given to walking and cycling within local planning and transport policies.</p>

<p>Developing an LCWIP will help an authority make a strong case for future investment in active travel infrastructure. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-cycling-and-walking-infrastructure-plans-technical-guidance-and-tools">guidance and tools on developing an LCWIP</a>.</p>

<p>The main outputs from an LCWIP are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mapped network plan for walking and cycling that identifies preferred routes, current and future travel patterns, and core zones for further development</li>
  <li>prioritised programme of infrastructure improvements for future investment in the short, medium and long term that contributes towards meeting broader local goals</li>
  <li>report that sets out the underlying analysis, including the barriers and enablers for walking and cycling, and provides a narrative to support the improvements identified</li>
</ul>

<p>As of September 2020, 45 of the 46 local authorities that took part in the original <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> LCWIP pilot scheme had submitted an LCWIP.</p>

<p>Cycling measures, infrastructure and networks identified in an LCWIP should follow the best practice guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120">Local Transport Note 1/20</a> on delivering high-quality cycling infrastructure.</p>

<p>Authorities can ensure that new infrastructure is inclusive by following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wheelsforwellbeing.org.uk/campaigning/guide/" rel="external">Wheels for Wellbeing guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Wave 5 of the National Travel Attitudes Survey identified safety as a major concern among those who would like to cycle more often. One action to boost cycling is to provide dedicated road space for cyclists. The development of a network of high-quality, segregated cycling infrastructure, through inclusion in LCWIPs, will encourage growth.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> notes that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/decarbonising-transport-growing-cycle-use" rel="external">a mixture of measures is needed alongside segregated infrastructure to develop safe cycling networks</a>, including vehicle speed and volume management.</p>

<p>To support the development of LCWIPs, Sustrans produced a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/research/all-themes/all/common-misconceptions-about-active-travel-investment/" rel="external">report addressing 9 misconceptions</a> about implementing cycling infrastructure.</p>

<p>For each myth, it provides evidence and sample messages to support a communications campaign and make the case for increased investment in active travel.</p>

<p>On 6 July 2022, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> published the second statutory <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-second-cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS 2)</a>, which covers the period between 2021 and 2025. The strategy includes new and updated objectives including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increasing levels of walking and walking to school</li>
  <li>doubling cycling</li>
  <li>increasing the proportion of journeys in towns and cities that are walked or cycled</li>
</ul>

<p>It also sets out the funding in place to achieve these objectives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Develop a Travel Demand Management Plan</h2>

<p>LTAs in England can assist in encouraging active travel by developing a Travel Demand Management (TDM) plan.</p>

<p>These aim to manage pressure on a transport network under times of heightened demand and uncertainty. An effective TDM plan can contribute data to the development of an LCWIP, as well as strengthen the case for investment.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-demand-management-toolkit-for-local-authorities">toolkit for LTAs on developing TDM plans</a>, produced by Mott MacDonald, can be used to support LTAs in developing TDM plans following COVID-19.</p>

<p>The toolkit also allows authorities to manage other scenarios where there are pressures on the transport network or times of higher demand. The toolkit includes worked scenarios, a template action plan and sample questions to answer during the data-gathering exercise.</p>

<p>To be effective, TDM plans need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>leadership, support and endorsement from all agencies within the LTA area</li>
  <li>clear identification of the problem and size of the challenge</li>
  <li>range of alternative travel options available</li>
  <li>strength of message to influence travel</li>
  <li>good communication channels to ensure messages reach their intended audience</li>
  <li>focused approach with audience and mode segmentation</li>
  <li>trust and credibility (from the audience) in the quality of information provided</li>
  <li>consistent message across all stakeholders built around the core narrative</li>
  <li>time and resources to implement the plan</li>
  <li>ability to track and monitor impacts</li>
</ul>

<h4>Implementing active travel: TDM in the West Midlands</h4>

<p>Transport for the West Midlands (TfWM) developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.activetravel.org.uk/case-studies/" rel="external">TDM programme</a>, including a strategy and delivery plan, in August 2020, in anticipation of pupils returning to school following COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>

<p>TfWM worked with districts and transport operators to implement measures designed to avoid a mismatch between travel demand and supply. Travel planners undertook surveys to identify schools in need of support and produced a toolkit and supporting communications material.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing active travel: TDM in North Yorkshire</h4>

<p>North Yorkshire County Council developed a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.activetravel.org.uk/case-studies/" rel="external">TDM plan</a> to support modal shift from cars to active travel when schools returned from lockdown. It focused on behaviour change to raise awareness of transport options, particularly active travel and road safety.</p>

<p>A brand identity and core messaging were developed, along with a social media content plan to target specific demographics and signpost to resources such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://opennorthyorkshire.co.uk/" rel="external">Open North Yorkshire</a>. Since then, 18% of trips have switched to non-car travel – 9% to active travel and 9% to public or school transport.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Plan for active travel</h2>

<p>As planning and transport authorities, local authorities play a significant role in enabling residents to use active travel modes.</p>

<p>Concepts such as low traffic or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tcpa.org.uk/the-20-minute-neighbourhood" rel="external">20-minute neighbourhoods</a> can ensure that developments, and redevelopments, consider and make provision for active travel, ensuring that a car is not the only practical way to access services.</p>

<p>The government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan">Transport decarbonisation plan</a> contains a commitment to embed the transport decarbonisation principles in spatial planning and an ambition to make walking, cycling and public transport the first natural choice for journeys.</p>

<p>One of the commitments of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gear-change-one-year-on-review">Gear Change</a> was the establishment of Active Travel England (ATE). ATE launched as an executive agency in January 2022, with one of its stated objectives being to improve the provision of cycling and walking infrastructure.</p>

<p>ATE will be a statutory consultee in the spatial planning system, approve and inspect cycling and walking schemes and support local authorities through the sharing of knowledge and good practice.</p>

<p>As the <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> reports, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/decarbonising-transport-growing-cycle-use" rel="external">easy access to destinations such as employment, education, healthcare and leisure facilities, will encourage take-up</a>, as will incorporating green routes, parks and water features into infrastructure. More direct and better connected routes and secure bike parking at critical points to allow inter-modal journeys, help to extend the reach of cycling.</p>

<p>Sustrans’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/research/all-themes/all/inclusive-cycling-in-cities-and-towns/" rel="external">Cycling for Everyone</a> report looks at how to improve access to cycling and reduce inequality through improvements to governance, planning and decision-making. It includes recommendations on making cycling more inclusive encompassing scheme design, public engagement and user safety.</p>

<h3>Low traffic neighbourhoods</h3>

<p>Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (<abbr title="Low Traffic Neighbourhoods">LTNs</abbr>) consist of residential side streets that are closed to through motor traffic to prevent rat-running. They have a physical barrier or, increasingly, an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) camera. No street is closed entirely – you can still drive to or from any point in an <abbr title="Low Traffic Neighbourhood">LTN</abbr>, but you might have to take a longer way round.</p>

<p><abbr title="Low Traffic Neighbourhoods">LTNs</abbr> have been shown to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase physical activity through more walking and cycling</li>
  <li>benefit local businesses through increased sales and higher spend</li>
  <li>create new public space</li>
  <li>improve air quality and reduce pollution</li>
  <li>decrease car use for short trips</li>
  <li>strengthen communities and increase social interaction between neighbours</li>
</ul>

<p>Sustrans provides <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/for-professionals/infrastructure/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design/an-introductory-guide-to-low-traffic-neighbourhood-design-contents/" rel="external">guidance on introducing low traffic neighbourhoods</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">20-minute </span> neighbourhoods</h3>

<p>The implementation of <abbr title="Low Traffic Neighbourhoods">LTNs</abbr> can support the creation of 20-minute neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Sustrans identifies them as places where residents can live without needing a car. Central to their development is aligning spatial and transport planning to allow residents to walk, cycle or use public transport to access services they need (including shops, jobs, education, open space, entertainment and GPs) and ensure that neighbourhoods are inclusive, accessible and equitable.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2020/in-your-community/what-is-a-20-minute-neighbourhood" rel="external">Research shows</a> that people are happy to walk for 20 minutes to get to the places they need to go. Eighty percent of journeys under a mile are made on foot, which usually equates to around a 20-minute walk.</p>

<p>Both 20-minute and low traffic neighbourhoods may be challenging to implement in rural areas, and some communities may share services so that one destination meets multiple needs. Good public transport options will be essential in rural areas.</p>

<p>The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tcpa.org.uk/guide-the-20-minute-neighbourhood" rel="external">introductory guide to 20-minute neighbourhoods</a> for local authorities in March 2021.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing active travel: Levenshulme and Burnage Active Neighbourhood</h4>

<p>Sustrans worked with Manchester City Council, Bespoke Transport Consulting, Transport for Greater Manchester and local community groups as part of the Bee Network to create the first ‘active neighbourhood’ in the Levenshulme and Burnage area of South Manchester. An active neighbourhood aims to prioritise the movement of people over motor traffic.</p>

<p>This scheme intends to create an Active ‘filtered’ Neighbourhood, using planters to reduce traffic in the area and encourage residents to use other forms of sustainable transport – particularly walking and cycling.</p>

<p>Consultations are currently underway and the scheme is expected to be completed by March 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://activetravel.tfgm.com/schemes/manchester/levenshulme-and-burnage-active-neighbourhood/" rel="external">Levenshulme and Burnage Active Neighbourhood</a> is now being managed by Manchester City Council.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Develop a behaviour change programme for active travel</h2>

<p>Authorities can stimulate a shift to active travel for short journeys through effective communication, design and implementation of behaviour change interventions.</p>

<p>As local leaders, planning authorities, transport authorities and employers, authorities can demonstrate best practice by modelling approaches to increase walking and cycling and promote the benefits of embedding active travel within staff engagement and carbon reduction plans.</p>

<p>Active Travel behaviour change interventions could include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>cycle and e-cycle hire schemes</li>
  <li>business grants to provide facilities or equipment</li>
  <li>travel planning</li>
  <li>cycling skills courses (for children, adults and families)</li>
  <li>walking and cycling engagement events</li>
  <li>school-focused initiatives</li>
  <li>measures to improve cycle security</li>
  <li>measures to tackle inclusion and accessibility barriers</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence shows that it is more effective to develop behaviour change and infrastructure projects together, rather than in isolation.</p>

<p>Developing and implementing a programme of behaviour change initiatives for staff and residents will enable use of new infrastructure and reduce reliance on cars.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/decarbonising-transport-growing-cycle-use" rel="external">Growing Cycle Use</a> suggests that local authorities should embed cycling in local culture through integration into school, workplaces and towns.</p>

<p>Designing inclusive approaches that take advantage of, and build on, existing programmes that have high value for money, such as Living Streets’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.livingstreets.org.uk/walk-to-school" rel="external">Walk to School</a> Outreach and Cycling UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cyclinguk.org/bigbikerevival" rel="external">Big Bike Revival</a>, and engaging with national events, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cyclinguk.org/bikeweek" rel="external">Bike Week</a> or Walk to School week, can drive uptake. Initiatives targeted at school-age children especially would help to create a local active travel culture from an early age.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing active travel: gamification to encourage active travel</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140521003054" rel="external">Research by Cardiff Metropolitan University</a> has highlighted the benefit of combining infrastructure for active travel with novel behaviour change techniques. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.beatthestreet.me/" rel="external">Beat the Street</a> is an active travel engagement platform that encourages players to use active travel to move around their area, swiping their cards at consecutive locations to earn points.</p>

<p>Evaluation conducted by researchers on levels of active travel before and after intervention found that the number of players doing less than 30 minutes of activity per week decreased by 7% and those reporting more than 150 minutes of activity increased by 13%. The study also reported 53% fewer cars and vans in the morning commute and 33% fewer cars in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Cycle training</h3>

<p>Providing cycle training for staff and residents can enable greater uptake of cycling through increasing confidence and skill of participants.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-standard-for-cycle-training">national standard for cycle training</a> describes the skills and understanding needed to cycle safely and responsibly and to enable others to cycle. Any cycle training to support safe cycling on the road should be based on the national standard.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bikeability.org.uk/about-cycle-training/" rel="external">Bikeability cycle training</a> is the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>-approved and funded method of delivering national standard training. It is a practical training programme, enabling trainees to cycle safely and confidently on today’s roads and learn basic cycle maintenance skills. It must be delivered by trained and registered instructors, registered and quality assured by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bikeability.org.uk/" rel="external">Bikeability Trust</a>.</p>

<p>Your local authority may have an in-house team of registered Bikeability instructors or hold a contract with an independent training provider. Contracts are usually managed by road safety, active or sustainable travel teams.</p>

<p>Outside London, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> provides funding to local highway authorities to deliver Bikeability in schools and the community. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bikeability.org.uk/about/funding-and-delivery/" rel="external">Grants for Bikeability training</a>  are managed by the Bikeability Trust.</p>

<p>In London, cycle training is funded by Transport for London (TfL) and the boroughs. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cycling.scot/" rel="external">Scotland</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cardiffcycleworkshop.org.uk/" rel="external">Wales</a> have separate arrangements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>-funded Bikeability is managed and arranged via a school games organiser (<abbr title="school games organiser">SGO</abbr>) host school, rather than by the local authority. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bikeability.org.uk/about/funding-and-delivery/" rel="external">list of SGOs in receipt of Bikeability grants</a> is available on the Bikeability website.</p>

<p>While Bikeability is primarily associated with children and the majority of Bikeability training is delivered through the school’s programme, the scheme also includes modules aimed at adults and family groups.</p>

<p>Since the programme started in 2007, more than 3 million children have received Bikeability training, and <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and the Bikeability Trust are working together to develop plans so that every child and adult can take up an offer of training.</p>

<h3>Promoting active travel to work</h3>

<p>Authorities can lead by example by promoting active travel to their staff and working with local businesses to promote active travel to employees.</p>

<p>Research carried out by the behavioural insights team (<abbr title="behavioural insights team">BIT</abbr>), working with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>, sets out to develop <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/increasing-uptake-of-cycling-following-covid-19-travel-disruption">policy options to convert high levels of cycling during the COVID-19 pandemic into more long-term travel habits</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.activetravel.org.uk/moment-of-change/" rel="external">A Moment of Change: Guidance for local authorities on promoting an active return to work</a> focuses on the cycle to work policy option from the <abbr title="behavioural insights team">BIT</abbr> research, and provides a comprehensive toolkit to support local authorities in the design, implementation and evaluation of behaviour change programmes that promote an active return to work.</p>

<p>It covers developing, funding and choosing a model for a behaviour change programme, as well as suggested initiatives, case study examples of different interventions and resources to help build a business case and important messages.</p>

<p>Suggested actions from the guidance include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure your policies support and promote active travel where appropriate</li>
  <li>undertake a travel survey to find out how your staff currently travel and the barriers to active travel or public transport use</li>
  <li>consider developing staff travel plans to identify practical lower-carbon commuting options</li>
  <li>provide safe and secure cycle storage at your offices</li>
  <li>provide e-cycle charging to encourage those with a slightly longer commute to cycle</li>
  <li>provide access to showers for those who choose to run or cycle in. This can be in your office, or at a nearby leisure centre</li>
  <li>appoint an active travel champion. They could organise a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/how-to-become-a-bike-buddy/" rel="external">bike buddy</a> scheme, coordinate participation in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/get-active/2019/everyday-walking-and-cycling/how-to-use-competition-to-change-the-way-your-staff-commute-to-work/" rel="external">active travel challenges</a> or organise bike maintenance sessions</li>
  <li>sign up to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bicycleassociation.org.uk/download/ba-guide-c2w/" rel="external">cycle to work</a> scheme, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/" rel="external">Cyclescheme</a> or the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.greencommuteinitiative.uk/" rel="external">Green Commute Initiative</a>. These are a form of employee benefits that allow staff to purchase bikes and accessories at a reduced cost, which is reclaimed through an employee’s pay</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.activetravel.org.uk/funding/" rel="external">Active Travel Portal</a> has a guide to the funding options available to local authorities, including annual allocations that can support active travel, as well as competitive funds.</p>

<p>The UK government’s capability fund was announced in July 2021 and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/capability-fund-local-transport-authority-allocations">allocated revenue funding to all local authorities (outside London)</a> to enable more walking and cycling in their local areas through developing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120"><abbr title="Low Traffic Neighbourhood">LTN</abbr> 1/20</a> compliant infrastructure plans and undertaking behaviour change activity.</p>

<p>Guidance issued to all authorities as part of the capability fund allocation highlights the need to monitor and evaluate the impact of schemes delivered through the fund. Authorities are required to report their progress and share the findings of their evaluation with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The capability fund will be followed by a capital grants fund, allocated to authorities based on the quality of the plans developed.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bikeability.org.uk/professionals/for-grant-recipients/" rel="external">Funding for Bikeability Cycle training in schools and the community</a>  in England (outside London) is available from <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and training is delivered by Bikeability.</p>

<p>Local authorities agree their funding allocation and training activities with the Bikeability Trust at the start of the calendar year.</p>

<p>Any local authority wishing to discuss their allocation should contact the Bikeability Trust in the first instance.</p>
