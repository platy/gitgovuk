<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This user guide accompanies the Home Office collection ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/animals-in-science-statistics">Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain</a>’. The statistics in the collection relate to regulated scientific procedures performed using living animals under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/308593/ConsolidatedASPA1Jan2013.pdf.">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Uses of the statistics</h3>

<p>The expected uses of the statistics are listed using the standard categorisation for Official Statistics.</p>

<p>a) Informing the general public’s choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>about the state of the economy, society and the environment – figures on animal scientific procedures are used by the media</li>
  <li>about the performance of government and public bodies – figures on levels and trends in animal scientific procedures are requested via Parliament Questions and Freedom of Information Act request</li>
</ul>

<p>b) Government policy making and monitoring</p>

<p>c) Resource allocation – typically by central and local government</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Data coverage and source</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Legislation and purpose of collection</h3>

<p>The annual statistics publication relates to scientific procedures performed using living animals subject to the provisions of ASPA. Section 21A ASPA requires licensing and oversight of all places, projects, and people who want to conduct scientific procedures on living animals. The act also states that annual statistics on protected animals (this release) should be published annually and laid in parliament.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Data source</h3>

<p>All scientific procedures carried out on living animals in the UK, subject to ASPA, must be authorised under a project licence, granted by the Home Secretary. The statistics are collected via online data returns submitted by project licence holders at the end of each calendar year, or within 28 days of the termination of the licence when this occurs during the year. Since the 2021 collection, this data is held in and extracted from the Animals in Scientific Procedures e-Licensing (ASPeL) system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Data coverage</h3>

<p>Within the UK, the Home Office collects and publishes information on regulated procedures for Great Britain, while in Northern Ireland the Department of Health separately collects and publishes this information under devolved arrangements.</p>

<p><strong>Regulated procedures</strong> are defined in ASPA as any procedure applied to a protected animal for an experimental or other scientific purpose, or for an educational purpose, that may have the effect of causing an animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice.</p>

<p><strong>Protected animals</strong> are defined in the ASPA as any living vertebrate other than man and any living cephalopod. As ASPA indicates, the breeding of an animal is a regulated procedure if the animal is bred from, or is the descendant of, an animal whose genes have mutated or been modified.</p>

<p>The annual statistics publication predominately focuses on experimental procedures and procedures counted under the creation and breeding of genetically altered (GA) animals separately.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental procedures</strong> include all animals used in basic research, regulatory use, translational/applied research, protection of the natural environment, higher education and training, preservation of species and forensic enquiries.</p>

<p>The <strong>creation and breeding of GA animals</strong> includes some animals that were bred with the intention of producing GA animals, but resulted in non-GA animals being born. In addition, some animals used for the creation of a new genetic line would also have been genetically normal animals e.g. those used for superovulation (production of eggs). These animals were not used in experimental procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Counting rules</h3>

<p>The figures provided in the statistical report refer to the numbers of procedures (completed) rather than the numbers of animals used (for the first time), unless indicated otherwise. However, in most cases, the number of procedures corresponds to the number of animals used. In instances where the number of procedures is higher than the number of animals used, this is due to a re-use of animals.</p>

<p>Each procedure (which may consist of several stages) is counted once for the year in which it was completed.</p>

<p>A study involving procedures on a number of animals is counted once for each animal. Where an animal that has previously been used in a completed procedure is used again for a further procedure (‘re-use’) it is counted as a separate procedure, but the animal itself is not recounted. The circumstances in which the re-use of an animal is permitted are limited (see section 5.19 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662364/Guidance_on_the_Operation_of_ASPA.pdf" rel="external">Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a>).</p>

<p>Procedures on adult or free-living animals (including neonatal and juvenile mammals, and newly hatched birds) are counted. Details of procedures on immature forms (e.g. larvae, embryos) are not counted unless they have reached the free-feeding stage (e.g. zebrafish from five days post-fertilisation and tadpoles).</p>

<p>Animals in the wild involved in rodenticide trials are also not counted. A rodenticide trial is the testing of any substance that is used to kill rats, mice, and other rodent pests. Information is collected on the number of project licences which undertake rodenticide trials.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Exclusions</h3>

<p>The controls of ASPA, and therefore the statistics in the annual release, exclude:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-experimental agricultural practices</li>
  <li>non-experimental clinical veterinary practices</li>
  <li>practices undertaken for recognised animal husbandry</li>
  <li>the administration of any substance or article to an animal for research purposes in accordance with an animal test certificate granted under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/2033/contents" rel="external">Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013 Sect 3 (2) (b)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The annual statistics also exclude:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘genetically normal’ (i.e. non-GA) animals that were bred for scientific procedures but were killed or died without being used in procedures</li>
  <li>animals that were subject to procedures for the purposes of genotyping (the process of investigating the genetic makeup of an animal)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Home Office published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/additional-statistics-on-breeding-and-genotyping-of-animals-for-scientific-procedures-great-britain-2017">additional statistics on breeding and genotyping of animals for scientific procedures for 2017</a> as experimental statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Data quality and methodology</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Data quality</h3>

<p>The UK Statistics Authority has designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, signifying compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/the-code/" rel="external">Code of Practice for Statistics</a>.</p>

<h4>National Statistics status</h4>

<p>National Statistics status means that our statistics meet the highest standards of 
trustworthiness, quality, and value, and it is our responsibility to maintain compliance with these standards.</p>

<p>The designation of these statistics as National Statistics was confirmed in 2007 following a compliance check by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/osr/" rel="external">Office for Statistics Regulation</a>. The statistics last underwent a full <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/images-assessmentreport203statisticsonscientificproceduresonlivinganimal_tcm97-41802.pdf" rel="external">assessment against the code of practice</a> in 2012.</p>

<p>Since the latest review by the Office for Statistics Regulation, we have continued to comply with the Code of Practice for Statistics, and have made the following improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transitioned to a new online data collection system, with data validation to prevent invalid combinations of data being entered</li>
  <li>created a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) to automate quality assurance processes and the production of statistical outputs, in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/" rel="external">RAP principles</a>
</li>
  <li>for the 2017 data onwards, data collected on ‘other’ species is subject to data quality checks which have allowed for further analyses of the animals returned under ‘other’ (non-Schedule 2) species categories</li>
  <li>each year, we consult with colleagues in the Animals in Science Regulation Unit to ensure the collection remains suitable for its purpose</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Quality assurance</h3>

<p>These statistics are compiled by statisticians within the Home Office. They undertake a wide range of quality assurance checks with the expert assistance of colleagues in the Animals in Science Regulation Unit, and with follow-up contact with data suppliers as needed. These checks follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/images-settingthestandar_tcm97-44370.pdf" rel="external">QAAD guidance</a> (Quality Assurance of Administrative Data) and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compiling the administrative data to highlight outliers and possible errors</li>
  <li>variance checks, i.e. investigating substantial changes in figures compared with the previous year</li>
  <li>including safeguards within the return to improve data quality</li>
  <li>ensuring all returns are accounted for, and that no duplicate returns are provided</li>
  <li>querying incomplete data, or invalid data/combinations of data, provided in returns</li>
  <li>investigating returns which contain unusual data or unusual combinations of data</li>
  <li>explaining to users about the data quality and the impact upon the statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Data quality issues</h3>

<h4>Changes to data collection from 2014</h4>

<p>Following the European Directive 2010/63/EU being transposed into UK law (the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/14/contents" rel="external">animals in scientific procedures act 1986</a>) in January 2013, the 2014 collection underwent substantial changes. As a result, some inconsistencies were expected in the reporting of the 2014 information.</p>

<p>Previously the Home Office counted ‘procedures started’ but post 2014 this changed to ‘procedures completed’.  As a result, procedures started before 2014 but completed in 2014 should have been reported in both the pre-2014 and 2014 figures.</p>

<p>Additionally, there were discrepancies of a small number of duplicate returns, and misclassifications of reported severity in the 2014 collection. Home Office statisticians have since reviewed their processes and quality assurance checks in light of these issues.</p>

<h4>Rounding</h4>

<p>Data may be rounded to simplify the presentation of the figures. However, all numeric and percentage calculations are based on unrounded data. Where data are rounded, they may not sum to the totals shown, or, in the case of percentages, to 100%, because they have been rounded independently.</p>

<p>The rounding conventions used in the release, unless otherwise stated, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>over 1 million</strong> - presented as millions and rounded to two decimal places e.g. 2,121,582 = 2.12 million</li>
  <li>
<strong>10,000 to 999,999</strong> - rounded to the nearest thousand e.g. 343,465 = 343,000</li>
  <li>
<strong>1,000 to 9,999</strong> - rounded to the nearest hundred e.g. 8,465 = 8,500</li>
  <li>
<strong>10 to 999</strong> - rounded to the nearest ten e.g. 47 = 50</li>
  <li>
<strong>less than 10</strong> - unrounded, whole numbers</li>
  <li>
<strong>percentages greater than 1%</strong> - rounded to the nearest percent e.g. 1.43% = 1%</li>
  <li>
<strong>percentages less than 1%</strong> - rounded to one significant figure e.g. 0.43% = 0.4%, and 0.043% = 0.04%</li>
</ul>

<p>The data in the data tables are unrounded. All percentages in the data tables are rounded to the nearest 0.1%.</p>

<h4>Revisions</h4>

<p>It is standard practice across all Home Office statistical releases to incorporate revisions to previous years’ data in the latest release. Corrections and revisions follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/341674/ho-compliance-state-aug14.pdf">Home Office’s statement of compliance</a> with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Great Britain</h3>

<p>On 8 November 2018 the Home Office published ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/additional-statistics-on-breeding-and-genotyping-of-animals-for-scientific-procedures-great-britain-2017">Additional statistics on breeding and genotyping of animals for scientific procedures, Great Britain 2017</a>’. These experimental statistics were collected by the Home Office under the EU Directive (2010/63/EU) and cover the number of ‘genetically normal’ (i.e. non-genetically altered (non-GA)) animals that were bred for scientific procedures but were killed or died without being used in procedures, and the number of animals (GA and non-GA) subject to tissue sampling for the purposes of genotyping.</p>

<p>The statistics presented in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-of-scientific-procedures-on-living-animals">Statistics on animals in scientific procedures</a> have been collected since 2001 and are available online. Data was collected under different categories prior to 2014, meaning some of the data (e.g. for species, purpose, genetic status, severity) is not comparable or does not exist.</p>

<p>Older editions of this statistical release may be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100613204643/http:/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/scientific1.html" rel="external">the national archives</a>. However, not all previous publications are available online. Annual publications giving detailed figures for scientific procedures under ASPA have been published as ‘Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals’ since 1987. Detailed figures for experiments on living animals under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 were published as ‘Statistics of experiments on living animals’ between 1977 and 1986. Less detailed information about experiments on living animals for the years prior to 1977 was published in the form of a ‘Return to an Address of the Honourable the House of Commons’.</p>

<p>Forthcoming publications are pre-announced on the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/announcements">Statistics: release calendar</a>’ on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Northern Ireland</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/statistics-scientific-procedures-living-animals-northern-ireland" rel="external">Statistics for scientific procedures in Northern Ireland</a> can be found on the Northern Ireland Department for Health website. The data for Northern Ireland are collected in the same manner and undergo similar quality assurance processes as the data for Great Britain, meaning the two datasets can be used for comparison.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>European Union</h3>

<p>In 2018, ASRU made arrangements for EU exit by preparing legislation, known as a Statutory Instrument, to amend ASPA and deliver EU exit. This Statutory Instrument, UK Statutory Instrument 2019 No.72 The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, was enacted on 31 January 2020, the day of EU exit. The legislation had the result of removing the requirements for mandatory reporting of information on scientific procedures to the European Commission (EC).</p>

<p>The UK will no longer submit information on scientific procedures on animals to the EC. Therefore, UK data will no longer be incorporated into EC published reports on procedures on living animals in the EU.</p>
