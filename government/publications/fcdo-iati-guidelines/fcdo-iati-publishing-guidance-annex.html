<h2>Annex: How to build your publication</h2>

<p>An important advantage of IATI is its flexibility. Programmes and underlying projects can be “modelled” in an IATI activity file in multiple ways. FCDO has developed some suggested models to make it easier to combine data from various publishers and create a full picture of how aid is delivered.</p>

<p>These models are not exhaustive, and you may need to combine elements from different models to best represent your activities. Use what is most appropriate for your organisation’s context.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>The roles and responsibilities of different participating organisations need to be clearly defined. IATI recognises different roles for participating organisations: Funding, Accountable, Implementing and Extending.</p>

<p>When publishing to IATI, each organisation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only publishes the activities for which it is responsible, and therefore accountable for</li>
  <li>only mentions partner organisations with which it has a direct relationship. For example, if FCDO funds Organisation B who in turn funds Organisation C, Organisation C only refers to Organisation B as a funder, and not ‘up the chain’ to FCDO</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example models</h3>

<p>The first step in structuring your data is to determine which model best fits your organisation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Project funding: if your organisation manages a project, spending or transferring funds to other organisations.</li>
  <li>Programme funding: if your organisation manages a large programme made up of smaller projects. Funds are generally managed at the “parent” programme level, while transfers or spending usually take place at the “child” project level. This model also works for basket or pooled funds and situations where co-funding is received directly at the child level.</li>
  <li>Partnerships: if your organisation works in a network or strategic alliance. Funding is generally received by a lead organisation and divided amongst partners on a programme level. Each member of the alliance or network then deploys its own activities.</li>
  <li>Core funding: if your organisation receives unearmarked funding, from which you fund one or more activities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have identified a model or combination of models that best represent your programme, you can begin creating your IATI data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1) </span> Project funding model</h2>

<p>This model is for organisations that run an activity as a single project. Your organisation might implement the project yourselves or through organisations you fund.</p>

<p>Your organisation (Organisation B in the diagrams below) will publish a single IATI activity for the project, listing yourselves as accountable for the funding you receive and as an implementing organisation if applicable.</p>

<h3>Project funding with a single implementing organisation</h3>

<p>Narrative: 
Organisations A and B both publish an IATI activity file.</p>

<h4>Organisation A publishes Activity A (the funding activity)</h4>
<p>For this activity Organisation A is the funding organisation and accountable organisation. Organisation B is the implementing organisation.</p>

<p>Organisation A refers to Organisation B through its transactions with receiver organisation B.</p>

<h4>Organisation B publishes Activity B</h4>
<p>For this activity Organisation A is the funding organisation. Organisation B is accountable (towards Organisation A) and implementing.</p>

    </tr>

</table>

<p>Narrative: Organisations A, B and C each publish an IATI activity file.</p>

<h4>Organisation A publishes Activity A.</h4>

<p>For this activity Organisation A is the funding organisation and accountable organisation, and Organisation B is the implementing organisation.</p>

<p>Organisation A refers to Organisation B through its transactions, with receiver organisation B.</p>

<h4>Organisation B publishes Activity B.</h4>

<p>For this activity Organisation A is the funding organisation. Organisation B is accountable (towards Organisation A). Organisations B and C are implementing.</p>

<p>Organisation B refers to Organisation A through incoming commitment or incoming funds transactions, with provider organisation A and Activity A’s IATI identifier as provider-activity-id.</p>

<p>Organisation B refers to Organisation C through its transactions, with receiver organisation C.</p>

<h4>Organisation C publishes Activity C.</h4>

<p>For this activity Organisation B is the funding organisation, Organisation C is accountable (towards Organisation B), and Organisation C is implementing.</p>

<p>Organisation C refers to Organisation B through incoming commitment or incoming funds transactions, with provider organisation B and Activity B’s IATI identifier as provider-activity-id.</p>

<p>Note: if in this example Organisation B only disburses funds to Organisation C and does not work on implementation of the activity itself, Organisation B would mention only Organisation C as the implementing organisation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2) </span> Programme funding model</h2>

<p>This model is for a larger programme with underlying projects. Your organisation will publish multiple IATI activities in this instance – one for the overall programme and one for each of the projects. Incoming funds will be received for the programme, split between underlying projects, then spent or disbursed on to other organisations.</p>
