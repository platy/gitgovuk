<h2>
<abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr> board effectiveness review (“<abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr>”) principles</h2>

<p>The overarching principles that should underpin the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> must provide a robust review of the board’s effectiveness - including whether it has the structure, processes, people and performance to deliver. It must consider how it interacts with the executive and stakeholders, and whether respective roles are clear. It must involve feedback and&nbsp; perspectives from outside the board and consider best practice elsewhere;</li>
  <li>A <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> should focus on both outcomes and behaviours;</li>
  <li>In deciding the scope of the Review it is recognised that ‘no one size fits all’ for <abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr>. However, <abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr> should be comfortable in explaining why they have not complied with this guidance if they deviate from it;</li>
  <li>The department and <abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr> board should work together to implement its recommendations; and</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="board effectiveness reviews">BERs</abbr> should consider, and be considered by, any <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr> review that has been undertaken or is proposed for the body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed principles on the process are as follows.</p>

<h3>Preparation, including ‘who’ is responsible for delivery</h3>

<h4>The chair</h4>

<p>The chair must lead the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> and has overall responsibility for the process. If relevant, the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> should involve the senior independent director (<abbr title="senior independent director">SID</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> and other <abbr title="non-executive directors">NEDs</abbr> as appropriate. The chair should consider ways to obtain feedback from the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>’s employees and other stakeholders on the performance of the board.</p>

<h4>The Sponsoring Department</h4>

<p>The Sponsoring Department must be provided with a copy of the of the proposed scope of the review, and given an opportunity to feed into the scope and process of the review as appropriate. However, they should not seek to substitute their own views, or role, for that of the board.</p>

<h3>Frequency</h3>

<p>The chair must conduct a <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> annually and ensure that <abbr title="board effectiveness reviews">BERs</abbr> are externally facilitated every three years (see below).</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>The scope and areas of focus should be appropriate to the specifics of the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>. No one size fits all.</p>

<p>Areas which must be considered as part of the annual review include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How the board and its committees support the Accounting Officer in meeting the requirements set out within <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-public-money">Managing Public Money</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Areas which may be considered as part of the annual review include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The overarching culture and tone set by the board. Clarity of, and leadership given to, the purpose, direction and values of the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>;</li>
  <li>How the board has appropriately considered whether the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>’s policies and actions support Ministers’ strategic aims;</li>
  <li>The quality of relationships between all board members and its relationships with the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>’s stakeholders. In particular, relationships between the executive and non-executive members, the board and its sponsoring department and Ministers;</li>
  <li>How the board communicates with, listens and responds to, its organisation and other stakeholders;</li>
  <li>The composition of the board and its committees; including the balance of skills, experience, knowledge, and diversity (including diversity in its broadest sense, i.e. diversity of place);</li>
  <li>Processes for identifying, reviewing and managing risks;</li>
  <li>Succession and development plans;</li>
  <li>Progress on the implementation of recommendations made in the last annual review;</li>
  <li>Quality of the general information provided on the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr> and its performance, in particular KPIs used;</li>
  <li>Evidence that the board is using high quality performance data to assess whether outcomes and KPIs are being achieved, and how the board is challenging whether the data it is provided represents best practice;</li>
  <li>Quality and timing of papers and presentations to the board;</li>
  <li>Quality of discussions around individual proposals and time allowed. The process the chair uses to ensure sufficient debate for major decisions or contentious issues - including how constructive challenge is encouraged;</li>
  <li>Effectiveness of board committees, including their Terms of Reference, and how they are connected with the main board; and</li>
  <li>How the board’s practices, relationships and cultural norms compare with other <abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr> / best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further advice on the scope of reviews, and key areas to cover, can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/61232f60-a338-471b-ba5a-bfed25219147/2018-Guidance-on-Board-Effectiveness-FINAL.PDF" rel="external">Guidance on Board Effectiveness</a> from the Financial Reporting Council.</p>

<h3>Post-appraisal activities</h3>

<p>The chair must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure there is full transparency of both the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> process and the outcome between the organisation and the sponsor department;</li>
  <li>Ensure the processes and findings of the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> are included in the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>’s Annual Report and Accounts; and</li>
  <li>There is a clear programme of follow up actions and a plan to implement them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The chair and senior sponsor must ensure findings from the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> are considered in <abbr title="non-executive director">NED</abbr> and chair appraisals.</p>

<h2>Externally facilitated board effectiveness reviews</h2>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>An external review allows the board an opportunity for candid self-reflection, which can be difficult when the board is undertaking the review itself. An external reviewer may call upon wider best practice to support the review.</p>

<h3>When</h3>

<p>Must take place at least every three years. Boards should be willing to undertake an externally facilitated review outside of this cycle as appropriate, such as if there are special circumstances that might warrant an outside opinion.</p>

<h3>Who</h3>

<p>The chair should commission an external individual or organisation to undertake the external review.&nbsp;This could include asking an experienced <abbr title="non-executive director">NED</abbr> or chair from a different <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr> to undertake the review.</p>

<p>There may be a case, by exception, for the sponsor to take a more direct role in the review, i.e. if there are concerns about the chair’s performance.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>An external review is typically more detailed than an internal one, with greater focus on specific issues e.g. relationships and behaviours.</p>

<h3>Post-appraisal</h3>

<p>The chair must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure there is full transparency of both the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> process and the outcome between the organisation and the sponsor department;</li>
  <li>Ensure the processes and findings of the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> are included in the <abbr title="arm's length body">ALB</abbr>’s Annual Report and Accounts;</li>
  <li>There is a clear programme of follow up actions and a plan to implement them;</li>
  <li>Ensure findings from the <abbr title="board effectiveness review">BER</abbr> are considered in <abbr title="non-executive director">NED</abbr> and chair appraisals; and</li>
  <li>Make the final report available to the senior sponsor, the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) as well as relevant Ministers.</li>
</ul>
