<p>[DATE]</p>

<p>Dear [NAME]</p>

<p>Enforced removals to [DESTINATION COUNTRY] by charter flight on [DATE]</p>

<p>The Home Office intends to operate a charter flight to [ARRIVAL CITY], [DESTINATION COUNTRY]. The flight will have capacity for up to [X] persons liable to removal. As this is a chartered flight the aircraft may have to close its doors and move away from the stand shortly before the allocated time to comply with the departure slot. This could be up to 30 minutes before the departure slot.</p>

<p>Those [COUNTRY] nationals whom the Home Office intends to remove to [COUNTRY] will have been notified of their liability to be removed to [COUNTRY]. All persons to whom the special arrangements policy applies, will have been served with an assertive letter no less than five working days prior to removal from the United Kingdom informing them that they are to be removed by charter flight and that the special arrangements policy applies. The special arrangements policy is set out in the Immigration Enforcement general instruction on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1097656/Judicial_reviews_and_injunctions.pdf" rel="external">judicial reviews and injunctions</a>.</p>

<p>The special arrangements policy will not be applied to returnees on the charter flight who have not been served with an assertive letter. Judicial reviews lodged by persons not subject to the special arrangements policy will be considered under the relevant section of the Immigration Enforcement General Instructions (IEGI) on judicial reviews and injunctions.</p>

<p>If the Court issues an injunction for a person on the flight, this should be notified to the Home Office’s Operational Support and Certification Unit (<abbr title="Operational Support and Certification Unit">OSCU</abbr>) or the National Command and Control Unit (<abbr title="National Command and Control Unit">NCCU</abbr>) as per the instructions to judges considering urgent applications, by email and if possible confirmed by telephone. It would also assist us if the Court could notify the Home Office of injunctions which have been refused in the same way.</p>

<p>If judges considering urgent applications, or their clerks, require further information or copies of documentation on individual cases, they may contact the <abbr title="Operational Support and Certification Unit">OSCU</abbr> Duty Officer between the hours specified in the accompanying email to this letter. <abbr title="National Command and Control Unit">NCCU</abbr> will be available after these times.</p>

<p>For any urgent email communication, please follow with a telephone call to the <abbr title="Operational Support and Certification Unit">OSCU</abbr> Duty Officer to confirm receipt.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>[NAME]</p>

<p>For the Home Office</p>
