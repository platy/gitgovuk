<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political</h2>
<p>Uganda is a democratic republic with a multi-party system. President Yoweri Museveni and the National Resistance Movement (NRM) have been in power since 1986. President Museveni was re-elected in the January 2021 elections. While voting itself was conducted in relative calm, significant concerns raised in Uganda and internationally regarding the treatment of opposition candidates and journalists in the run-up to and since the elections, as well as the shut-off of the internet during the elections.</p>

<p>President Museveni has ambitions for Uganda to become a middle-income country by 2040 and in line with this, his government is prioritising investment in agriculture, infrastructure, and Uganda’s nascent oil industry.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Economic</h2>
<p>Uganda has been an economic success story in recent decades, with economic growth leading to GDP approximately doubling each decade from 1990 to 2010. Stable macroeconomics and a broadly supportive environment for private sector growth have provided the foundations, and enabled the country to remain resilient in the face of economic shocks.</p>

<p>More recently, Uganda’s trend rate of growth seemed to have fallen. Average annual economic from 1990 to 2009 was around 7%, but this fell to around 5% from 2010 to 2019. Furthermore, in 2020 GDP growth fell to 3%, driven by domestic measures which restricted parts of the economy to control the covid-19 virus coupled with external shocks from the pandemic including reduced foreign direct investment (FDI), tourism exports, cross-border trade and remittance flows. Agricultural production provided a fallback source of income for many Ugandans, and meant GDP growth significantly outperformed the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (3% versus -2%).</p>

<p>While Uganda has a hard-earned reputation for macroeconomic stability, its widening deficits on the fiscal and current accounts driven by the pandemic have left it more exposed to external shocks. Its growing debt burden (49% of GDP) recently influenced the IMF to judge that Uganda is at “moderate risk of debt distress”.</p>

<p>Resilience to the pandemic has also been helped by strong liquidity support from a Central Bank that is ready to act. Nevertheless, Uganda has requested their first IMF loan of $1bn to fund the COVID-19 recovery and mitigate constraints on their external position and public finances. Uganda also recently signed on to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) for 2021.</p>

<p>Key challenges faced by businesses in Uganda include high interest rates partly driven by government borrowing, high energy costs compared to other regions of Africa, and deficits in road, water and power in many parts of the country. Furthermore, the WEF ranked Uganda’s relatively weakest areas of competitiveness as being poor ICT adoption and poor skills development, both issues likely to be exacerbated by Uganda closing schools for two years during the pandemic – more than any other country in the world.</p>

<p>The Government of Uganda has taken measures to improve the business environment such as a  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ebiz.go.ug/" rel="external">‘One Stop Centre’</a> for starting a business. Ugandan Revenue Authority has adopted modern customs processes and e-services to speed up processes for clearing goods and payment of trade taxes. The development of the East African Community (EAC) Customs Union and increased EAC cooperation is helping strengthen regional trade.</p>

<p>Uganda has signed and ratified a number of trade and investment agreements providing access to a large regional and international market including the East African Community Customs Union, Common Market for East and Southern Africa and the new Continental Africa Free Trade Area. Regional integration is a key part of Uganda’s development strategy with the President championing closer integration across the African continent. With duty free access for most commodities to the regional market, numerous business opportunities exit. Uganda has delivered a strong COVID-19 trade response ensuring that trade continues. Challenges do however remain with timely clearance at borders impacting previous gains.</p>

<p>The FCDO funded Trademark East Africa programme is supporting Uganda to achieve reductions in the cost and time of trade through improved trade competitiveness and promotion of trade-led growth and poverty reduction. Key interventions include trade logistics facilities, one stop border posts and measures to reduce non-tariff barriers and increased cross border trade. Transport times for containers moving from Mombasa port to Kampala have declined providing clear evidence of the impact of improvements on trade.</p>

<p>Uganda introduced the Public Private Partnership Act in 2015 and has shown an appetite for foreign direct investment, especially in infrastructure. However, there remains an urgent need to improve access to power, transport infrastructure, reduce red tape and non-tariff barriers.</p>

<p>Uganda’s economy has undergone significant structural change since 1990. The contribution of agriculture to GDP fell from over 50% in 1992 to 23% in 2019 due to other sectors growing at a faster rate (though agribusiness contributes a large amount to the manufacturing sector), with industry contributing 21% and services 54%. Progress has been made to diversify the export base, with primary commodities (including agricultural produce) comprising 28% of Uganda’s goods exports in 2020. Uganda’s largest goods exports in 2020 were gold (56%), coffee and tea (16%), and fish (4%) .</p>

<p>Uganda has significant mineral resources, including oil, and mineral exports have grown exponentially in recent years and future oil exports are expected to bring in much needed revenue contributing to development.</p>

<p>Exports of services have also grown strongly recently – from 4% of GDP in 1990 to 14% in 2020 – with tourism and ICT driving the growth. The destination of goods exported has also changed, with a large shift to regional exports, with over 50% destined for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region.</p>

<p>The UK has invested heavily in the agriculture, infrastructure and energy sectors. UK expertise is well-respected and is exemplified by UK companies winning strategically important commercial deals to build an international airport in northern Uganda and construct the largest industrial park in Uganda. Uganda is open to foreign direct investment and significant opportunities are available for UK companies, especially in agriculture, infrastructure and energy which the Government of Uganda see as key for Uganda’s economic transformation. However, it should be noted that their appetite for taking on additional debt is limited to the most urgent needs.</p>

<p>Uganda accesses UK GSP preferences under the Least Developed Country Framework that provides duty free, quota free access on all products except arms/ammunition. Please note that goods exported from Uganda to the EU which are subsequently exported to the UK must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trading-with-developing-nations">non-manipulation rule</a> or else they will be treated as imports from the EU and therefore subject to tariffs.</p>

<p>In 2019 Uganda was ranked 115th (out of 141) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2019.pdf" rel="external">World Economic Forum’s Global Competiveness Index</a> and 116 (out of 190) in the discontinued World Bank’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/business-enabling-environment/" rel="external">‘Ease of Doing Business’</a> Index.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Bribery and Corruption</h2>
<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Corruption is endemic in Uganda which was ranked 144th (out of 180) in the 2021 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/uganda" rel="external">Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (CPI)</a>, (for the last 10 years scores between 25 and 27 out of 100). While publicly acknowledging the problem, the government needs to do more to address it. Anti-Money Laundering legislation was enacted in 2013.</p>

<p>Uganda risks being blacklisted by the Financial Action Task force (FATF), an international body that fights money laundering and corruption. In 2020, after being grey-listed by FATF, Uganda made a commitment to address its significant shortfalls by May 2022. A number of issues in Uganda’s Action Plan are still outstanding. This could impede attracting Foreign Direct Investments and elongate due diligence requirements in the banking sector. Some structural measures on this may be relevant to consider.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>Intellectual Property (IP) rights are territorial, that is, they only give protection in the countries where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, then you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets. There are a number of legal provisions pertaining to the administration and enforcement of copyright and intellectual property rights in Uganda. The Copyright Act 2008 makes provision for copyright of literary, musical and artistic works, cinematography pictures, gramophone records and broadcasts.</p>

<p>Piracy, IP rights infringement and counterfeiting are a problem in Uganda, cutting across all forms of goods and services. Uganda’s counterfeit problem is aggravated by the lack of adequate enforcement of trademark laws and weak punitive measures. The institutions currently responsible for enforcing the Trademark Act are the Uganda National Bureau of Standards, Uganda Revenue Authority, National Drug Authority and the Uganda Police.</p>

<p>According to the Uganda Revenue Authority, the most commonly counterfeited products are electric cables, electronic equipment, cosmetics, toothpaste, medicines (pharmaceutical products), pens, plastics, foods and beverages. Counterfeiting is also prevalent in agricultural produce such as herbicides and maize seeds.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Uganda Revenue Authority introduced digital tax stamps to goods to combat illicit trade, seal revenue leakages and boost collection and increased efficiency in managing taxpayer compliance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Human Rights</h2>
<p>Some areas of human rights have seen progress in the last decade, including the development of a comprehensive institutional framework for the protection of human rights through the Uganda Human Rights Commission, Human Rights Committee in parliament and establishment of human rights desks in key institutions.</p>

<p>However, there are concerns around restrictions to political and civic space (particularly in relation to democracy, freedom of assembly, association and expression), discrimination against vulnerable and marginalized groups, rule of law (e.g. lengthy pre-trial detention, detention without charge and poor prison conditions), use of torture, and limitations to freedom of expression via the usage of internet shutdowns.</p>

<p>The judiciary is perceived to be mostly independent. However, there are concerns about corruption in the judicial system. Whilst often a strong check on government decisions, the courts are not immune to political pressure. The commercial courts are effective but have capacity constraints. The judiciary has a large backlog of cases, many of which are land related (including disputes over ownership and tenancy). Uganda has ratified a number of international conventions on labour rights and transposed these into domestic legislation but has a mixed record on implementation and reporting.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Terrorism Threat</h2>
<p>Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Uganda. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners. Information on the terrorism threat in Uganda can be found in the  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/uganda">FCDO travel advice</a> for Uganda.</p>
