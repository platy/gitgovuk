<p>You must be tested for tuberculosis (TB) if you are coming to the UK for more than 6 months and are from South Africa, Lesotho or Swaziland.</p>

<p>Your test must be from a clinic approved by the Home Office. We won’t accept a TB test certificate from a clinic we haven’t approved.</p>

<p>Your test must be from a clinic approved by the Home Office and will need to obtain an IOM medical certificate confirming that they are free from TB. We will not accept a TB test certificate from a clinic we have not approved.</p>

<p>You do not need a certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a diplomatic passport holder travelling on official business or on a posting to the UK</li>
  <li>qualify for an exempt visa</li>
  <li>are applying for a certificate of entitlement</li>
  <li>applying as a returning residents</li>

<h2>Attending the clinic</h2>

<p>You should contact the clinic to book an appointment for a TB screening examination. You should not go to the clinic directly without receiving confirmation of your TB screening appointment through the clinic.</p>

<p>You should make it clear that you need the test for a UK visa application. You can expect to get an appointment within a few days of your request. At busy times you may have to wait 10 days for an appointment, especially during the UK student visa peak season between June and September. We cannot arrange or prioritise appointments for you.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a chest x-ray<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-tb-screening-for-the-uk-leaflet"> to test for TB</a>. If the result of the x-ray is not clear you may also be asked to give a sputum sample (phlegm coughed up from your lungs).</p>

<p>If your test shows that you do not have TB, you’ll be given a certificate which is valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray. Include this certificate with your UK visa application.</p>

<h3>Minors</h3>

<p>Applicants under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a <strong>parent or guardian</strong> who can provide consent and make decisions on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy</h3>

<p>Women of child-bearing age may be requested to provide a urine sample to test for pregnancy before undergoing a chest X-ray. If you are pregnant and undergoing a migration health assessment, you may choose to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proceed with the chest X-ray with a double leaded shielding to protect you and your unborn baby; or</li>
  <li>opt for sputum testing, where you will be requested to provide a sputum sample on 3 consecutive days; or</li>
  <li>wait to proceed with the migration health assessment until after giving birth</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to proceed with the chest X-ray, you will be requested to sign an additional consent form.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis</h3>

<p>TB is a contagious bacterial infection that is spread from person to person through tiny droplets in the air. TB can be either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Latent TB: when you have the bacteria in your body, but you don’t have any clinical manifestations.</li>
  <li>Active TB: when you have the bacteria and have clinical, radiological or laboratory manifestations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might be asked to undergo further testing if the doctor suspects you have active TB. In such an event, you will be provided with additional counselling and more information during your appointment.</p>

<p>You will be requested to provide 3 sputum samples over 3 consecutive days. These samples are then tested in a laboratory; it can take up to 8-10 weeks to obtain a result. The certificate is valid for 6 months from the date of medical exam and not from the date of sputum report.</p>

<h2>What you should bring with you:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>your passport or UNHCR/MHA registration documents</li>
  <li>proof of payment of the test fee (printed)</li>
  <li>online booking reference number</li>
  <li>photocopy of your identity document (<strong>Hatmed only</strong>)</li>
  <li>passport photo (<strong>Hatmed only</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like an appointment with a female clinician, please ask when you schedule your appointment.</p>

<p>If you need to cancel your appointment you should contact the clinic and refer to their cancellation policy and procedure.</p>

<p>The cost of the test is in addition to the visa application fee. You are unable to pay at the clinic.</p>

<h4>Payment details (IOM only)</h4>

<p>You must pay your fee using the following banking details before you arrive at the clinic.The booking reference number given must be used on the payment slip.</p>

  <li>Branch: Brooklyn</li>
  <li>Branch Code: 251345</li>
  <li>Swift Code: FIRNZAJJXXX</li>
</ul>

<p>The fee is not refundable if the person is tested positive for TB or decides not travel to the UK, or their visa is refused. For most applicants, this is where the testing process will end and your certificate will then be issued.</p>
