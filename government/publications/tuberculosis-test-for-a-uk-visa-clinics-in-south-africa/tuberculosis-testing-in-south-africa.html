<p>You must be tested for tuberculosis (TB) if you are coming to the UK for more than 6 months and are from South Africa, Lesotho or Swaziland.</p>

<p>Your test must be from a clinic approved by the Home Office and you will need to obtain an IOM medical certificate confirming that you are free from TB. We won’t accept a TB test certificate from a clinic we have not approved.</p>

<p>You do not need a certificate if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a diplomatic passport holder travelling on official business or on a posting to the UK</li>
  <li>qualify for an exempt visa</li>
  <li>are applying for a certificate of entitlement</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no approved clinics in Lesotho or Swaziland so if you’re from either of these countries you must travel to South Africa to be tested.</p>

<p>The approved clinics are:</p>

<h2>Attending the clinic</h2>

<p>You should contact the clinic to book an appointment for a TB screening examination. You should not go to the clinic directly without receiving confirmation of your TB screening appointment through the clinic.</p>

<p>You should make it clear that you need the test for a UK visa application. You can expect to get an appointment within a few days of your request. At busy times you may have to wait 10 days for an appointment, especially during the UK student visa peak season between June and September. We cannot arrange or prioritise appointments for you.</p>

<p>If you need to cancel your appointment, you should contact the clinic and refer to their cancellation policy and procedure.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a chest x-ray<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tuberculosis-tb-screening-for-the-uk-leaflet"> to test for TB</a>. If the result of the x-ray is not clear, you may also be asked to give a sputum sample (phlegm coughed up from your lungs).</p>

<p>If your test shows that you do not have TB, you’ll be given a certificate which is valid for 6 months from the date of your x-ray. Include this certificate with your UK visa application.</p>

<h3>Minors</h3>

<p>Applicants under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who can provide consent and make decisions on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy</h3>

<p>Women of child-bearing age may be requested to provide a urine sample to test for pregnancy before undergoing a chest x-ray. If you are pregnant and undergoing a migration health assessment, you may choose to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proceed with the chest x-ray with a double leaded shielding to protect you and your unborn baby</li>
  <li>opt for sputum testing, where you will be requested to provide a sputum sample on 3 consecutive days</li>
  <li>wait until after giving birth to proceed with the migration health assessment</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to proceed with the chest x-ray, you will be requested to sign an additional consent form.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis</h3>

<p>TB is a contagious bacterial infection that is spread from person to person through tiny droplets in the air. TB can be either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Latent TB: when you have the bacteria in your body, but you don’t have any clinical manifestations.</li>
  <li>Active TB: when you have the bacteria and have clinical, radiological or laboratory manifestations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might be asked to undergo further testing if the doctor suspects you have active TB. In such an event, you will be provided with additional counselling and more information during your appointment.</p>

<p>You will be requested to provide 3 sputum samples over 3 consecutive days. These samples are then tested in a laboratory; it can take up to 8-10 weeks to obtain a result. The certificate is valid for 6 months from the date of medical exam and not from the date of sputum report.</p>

<h2>What you should bring with you</h2>

<ul>
  <li>your passport or UNHCR/MHA registration documents</li>
  <li>proof of payment of the test fee (printed)</li>
  <li>online booking reference number</li>
  <li>photocopy of your identity document (<strong>Hatmed only</strong>)</li>
  <li>passport photo (<strong>Hatmed only</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like an appointment with a female clinician, please ask when you schedule your appointment.</p>

</table>

<p>The cost of the test is in addition to the visa application fee. You are unable to pay at the clinic.</p>

<h4>Payment details (IOM only)</h4>

<p>You must pay your fee using the following banking details before you arrive at the clinic. The booking reference number given must be used on the payment slip.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bank: FNB</li>
  <li>Account name: International Organisation for Migration</li>
  <li>Account number: 62165532724</li>
  <li>Branch: Brooklyn</li>
  <li>Branch code: 251345</li>
  <li>Swift code: FIRNZAJJXXX</li>
</ul>

<p>The fee is not refundable if you test positive for TB or decide not travel to the UK, or your visa is refused. For most applicants, this is where the testing process will end and your certificate will then be issued.</p>

<h2>Step-by-step procedures (IOM only)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the medical examination will be processed on Tuesdays (chest x-ray) and on Wednesdays (physical exam)</li>
  <li>all visa applicants must attend the clinic for the assessment with all the required documents</li>
  <li>the initial examination will include a counselling session and signing a consent form</li>
  <li>applicants aged 10 and under will go through a medical examination by the physician before a certificate is issued</li>
  <li>applicants aged 11 and above will have a chest x-ray done; applicants will then be reviewed by the doctor with the chest x-ray result before a certificate is issued</li>
  <li>additional sputum smears and cultures medical procedures may apply in case of abnormal chest x-ray findings and could take up to 8 weeks to get the final results</li>
  <li>a TB clearance certificate will be issued to the applicant on the day of the examination if the examination result is considered free of active pulmonary TB disease</li>
  <li>if you do not return within 7 days for sputum collection, you will not get a TB clearance certificate</li>
  <li>you will be given further testing or told to contact your own health care provider if the examination results are abnormal but the abnormality is not related to TB disease</li>
  <li>the TB clearance certificate expires 6 months from the chest x-ray date if you had a chest x-ray done, or 6 months from the physical examination date if you don’t need a chest x-ray</li>
  <li>the TB clearance certificate is valid for 3 months if you have been in contact with a family member with active pulmonary TB</li>
  <li>female applicants may be requested to undergo a pregnancy test, in case there is uncertainty as to whether they may be pregnant</li>
  <li>pregnant applicants can decide not to get a chest x-ray examination and instead either give sputum for a TB test on 3 consecutive mornings or delay the TB screening until after giving birth</li>
