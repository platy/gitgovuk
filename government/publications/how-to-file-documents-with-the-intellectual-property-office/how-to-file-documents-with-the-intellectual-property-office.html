<p>Our web filing service asks you a series of questions about your filing and prompts you to upload accompanying documents as PDF files. The system creates the completed patent form, filing receipt and fee sheet for you.</p>

<p>With this system you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply for a UK patent</li>
  <li>request entry of an International application (UK) into the national phase</li>
  <li>file certain patent forms and/or documents for pending application</li>
  <li>request an electronic uncertified office copy from a published UK patent or patent application</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1. </span> European Patent Office’s (<abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr>) online services</h3>

<p><abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr> online services is the package of software for secure online services. With this software you can electronically file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK national patent applications and associated forms</li>
  <li>European patent applications</li>
  <li>International <abbr title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</abbr> patent applications and other documents</li>
  <li>UK national patent forms and other documents</li>
</ul>

<p>To join you must complete the following processes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get your <a class="govuk-link" href="http://nrm2.epoline.org/myepoline/pcf/mainMenu.html" rel="external">smart card from the <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr></a>
</li>
  <li>to enrol to file at the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> you must hold a customer account with us. This can either be a deposit or cash account but if you do not have an account, you can open one by telephoning us on +44(0)16 3381 4939 or you could <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/about-epo-feedback.htm?maildest=6165&amp;src=38294" rel="external">send us a deposit or cash account request</a>
</li>
  <li>insert your smart card in the reader and fill in the on-line <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://olf.ipo.gov.uk/olf/enrol/" rel="external">auto enrolment tool</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have an existing <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr> smart card and move organisations, but still wish to file UK national patent forms and documents, a new smart card will be required. Unlike the <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr>, the UK Intellectual Property Office links the smart card number to the organisation’s deposit account, when the smart card was auto enrolled with the UK Intellectual Property Office.</p>

<p>You will need to make sure your UK software is kept update to date with the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/download.htm" rel="external">UK <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr> online service software</a>. Further information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.epo.org/applying/online-services/online-filing.html" rel="external"><abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr> online service</a> is available from the <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr>. If you have problems setting up or using the software, or have any concerns about <abbr title="European Patent Office'">EPO</abbr> online services, please contact us by telephone 0300 300 2000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2. </span> ePCT</h3>

<p>ePCT is the World Intellectual Property Office’s secure online service for filing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>International <abbr title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</abbr> patent applications</li>
</ul>

<p>You can join the service by creating a <abbr title="World Intellectual Property Office">WIPO</abbr> account, setup strong authentication and file via a web browser-based system, from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/faqs/index.html" rel="external">World Intellectual Property Office (<abbr title="World Intellectual Property Office">WIPO</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3. </span> Priority Document Access Service</h3>

<p>The Priority Document Access Service enables GB applicants to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>electronically file a GB application and request that an electronic copy be held in a secure database</li>
  <li>substantiate a claim to priority from an earlier application by utilising a copy of the priority document held in or accessible via a secure database at <abbr title="World Intellectual Property Office">WIPO</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4. </span> Further information</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> File by email</h2>

<p>For services that are not available online please email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:forms@ipo.gov.uk">forms@ipo.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>In the subject line of your email enter the form number, the IP right number and (optionally) your own reference. Provide these in the example format: TM16-UK00002345678-P1234GBAW</p>

<p>You must not email anything which you think might include information of relevance to national defence and security.</p>

<p>To avoid processing delays, when you send information to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:forms@ipo.gov.uk">forms@ipo.gov.uk</a>, follow this guide:</p>

<h4>Best practise:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>attach all files as PDFs and attach any supporting documents required to the same email as your form<br>
</li>
  <li>if you have more than one form to file, use a separate email for each form<br>
</li>
  <li>use plain text when sending emails to us. HTML emails can potentially be blocked by our email security, as can encrypted mail<br>
</li>
  <li>if you haven’t had an automated reply within an hour, call the information centre<br>telephone: 0300 300 2000<br>outside the UK: +44 (0)1633 814000</li>
  <li>If you email hasn’t been actioned within 10 working days, call the information centre</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do not:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>send copies of your email to any other <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> mailboxes; this will cause duplicate processing, delays and could mean multiple payments being taken<br>
</li>
  <li>use the forms@ipo.gov.uk inbox for anything other than filing forms and documents. Email other enquiries to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:information@ipo.gov.uk">information@ipo.gov.uk</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will accept typed or electronic signatures on forms and other documents that you file by email.
If you need support on saving your Word document as a PDF, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-or-convert-to-pdf-or-xps-in-project-desktop-d85416c5-7d77-4fd6-a216-6f4bf7c7c110#ID0EAADAAA=Windows" rel="external">Microsoft’s help page</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1. </span> File patent applications where s22 directions are required</h3>

<p>Patent applications where directions under s22 are required, for example when a government department, foreign government or classified government contract requires secrecy, should be filed in person between 9am and 5pm in envelopes marked ‘For the attention of Room GR70’.</p>

<p>The receptionist should also be informed that the application is for GR70 rather than the usual Front Office.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pedestrian access to the Newport site</h3>

<p>All visitors who are not pre-registered with us will need to remain outside the perimeter until a member of the information team (public searches etc) or their host can identify them before being allowed on site.</p>

<p>During core hours members of the public who come to deposit applications unannounced will be met at our reception by a member of our information centre.</p>

<p>Visitors arriving outside of core hours to file applications, will need to press the buzzer on arrival at the main gate and inform the security guard (who will be in the CCTV room), that they wish to deposit an application.</p>

<p>The guard will buzz them through giving them directions to <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> main reception following them using the CCTV on route.</p>

<p>Only send us the original documents as confirmation copies for Patent Cooperation Treaty (<abbr title="Patent Cooperation Treaty">PCT</abbr>) applications and for evidence, such as a statutory declaration. Please clearly mark these documents.</p>

<p>Each document you send must be legible and you are responsible for ensuring we can read it. If we cannot understand any part of the document received we will not give a filing date to that part.</p>

<p>Should you wish to be reassured we have received your request, please contact the <abbr title="Intellectual Property Office">IPO</abbr> on 0300 300 2000 or e-mail <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:information@ipo.gov.uk">information@ipo.gov.uk</a>. The office is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm, excluding bank holidays.</p>

<p>Please consider documents which incorporate photographic or other forms of representation, such as colour, may not transmit clearly.</p>
