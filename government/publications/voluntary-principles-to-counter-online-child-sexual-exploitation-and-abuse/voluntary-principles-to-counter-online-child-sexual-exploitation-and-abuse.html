<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Online child sexual exploitation and abuse is a
global crime that demands a global response.
In an increasingly digital and borderless world,
this crime is becoming easier to commit,
more extreme in nature and growing in scale.
These crimes have a devastating and lasting
impact on victims and survivors, and offenders
continuously adapt and diversify their methods
as technology rapidly evolves.</p>

<p>Keeping children safe from online sexual
exploitation and abuse and limiting their
revictimisation by preventing the sharing and
viewing of child sexual abuse material can
only be achieved through systematic crosssector collaboration. Only by strengthening
collaboration among governments, industry
and others and drawing on our collective skills
and resources will we achieve the safe online
environment that our children and the global
community expect and deserve.</p>

<p>Digital industry delivers many benefits through
its services and ability to connect people. This
industry is also instrumental in preventing
online services and platforms from being used
to facilitate online child sexual exploitation and
abuse. Platforms and services, including but not
limited to social media, gaming, livestreaming,
messaging services, app stores and devices, and
infrastructure providers such as internet service
providers, web-hosting and virtual private
networks can all play a part in combating online
child sexual exploitation and abuse. These
varying parts of the ecosystem will respond and
the principles will apply differently depending
on the provider’s role, available technology, the
nature of their terms of service and contractual
obligations.</p>

<p>Governments acknowledge the extensive
existing industry efforts to combat these crimes.
Companies have dedicated significant resources
to develop and deploy policies, tools and
processes in the fight to protect children online
and to detect, disrupt and identify offenders.
While significant progress has been made, there
is much more to be done to strengthen existing
efforts and enhance collective skills.</p>

<p>Our goal is the prevention of child sexual
exploitation and abuse. To this end, our five
Governments, having consulted with a wide
range of stakeholders including a leading group
of industry representatives, have developed this
set of voluntary principles.</p>

<p>The principles aim to provide a framework to
combat online child sexual exploitation and
abuse, and are intended to drive collective
action. It is anticipated that they will evolve over
time, as they are discussed with and adopted
by a much broader range of companies and
stakeholders. The WePROTECT Global Alliance,
which currently comprises 97 governments,
25 technology companies and 30 civil society
organisations, will promote and support the
adoption of the principles at a global level to
drive collective industry action.
to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that every service to
which these principles may apply is different.
Some services’ primary risk in combating
online child sexual exploitation and abuse
will relate to the sharing of abuse material,
while others may be more likely to be used for
grooming or livestreaming. As a result of the
services they offer, many companies will have
a combination of risk factors. A company’s
risk profile will determine the way in which it
applies the voluntary principles, and which ones
are relevant. When applying these principles,
companies will take into account technical
limitations, available resources, and legal and
privacy considerations.</p>

<p>These principles are intended to provide
a consistent and high-level framework for
industry actors that is flexible and can be
applied across different services. Some
companies have already implemented measures
similar to those outlined in these principles.
Regardless of whether a company chooses
to adopt these principles, existing laws and
regulations in relevant jurisdictions continue
to apply to all companies. Nothing in these
principles overrides or is contrary to the need
for companies to act according to law.</p>

<p>Examples of the types of things a company may
want to do to apply these principles include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review existing safety processes against each
of the applicable principles</li>
  <li>understand the level and nature of the online
child sexual exploitation and abuse threat
and areas of high risk on its platform</li>
  <li>identify gaps, consider where existing
measures can go further, and improve and
invest in innovative tools and solutions</li>
  <li>respond to the evolving threat and changing
societal and offending behaviours to reduce
foreseeable and unexpected risks for users.</li>
</ul>

<p>The voluntary principles are part of wider
efforts to protect children, both on and offline.
Governments, law enforcement agencies,
industry companies, non-governmental
organisations and other partners all have a
critical role to play as set out in the WePROTECT
Global Alliance’s Model National Response.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>The Voluntary Principles</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Prevent child sexual abuse material</h3>

<h4>Principle 1</h4>

<p>Companies seek to prevent
known child sexual abuse material from being
made available to users or accessible on their
platforms and services, take appropriate action
under their terms of service, and report to
appropriate authorities.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Companies, non-governmental
organisations and law enforcement agencies
have done significant work to identify and
catalogue child sexual abuse material.
This process can prevent the continued
circulation of such materials and avoid further
revictimising the children depicted. These
children suffer ongoing and additional trauma
each time materials depicting their abuse are
viewed. Reducing the availability of known
material can also help avoid further offending,
including offences concerning distribution.
Interventions where offenders are sharing
material on mainstream platforms without
actually transmitting files are also critical.</p>

<h4>Note on reporting to appropriate authorities</h4>
<p>(applicable to all relevant principles 1-5)</p>

<p>For companies based in the United States
of America, reporting is mandated via the
National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children (NCMEC). In other jurisdictions,
different reporting frameworks will apply
(whether under law or as otherwise arranged).
All reporting to authorities must be compliant
with applicable legislative frameworks.</p>

<h4>Principle 2</h4>

<p>Companies seek to identify
and combat the dissemination of new child
sexual abuse material via their platforms and
services, take appropriate action under their
terms of service, and report to appropriate
authorities.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>The threat to children depicted
in new materials is often different to the
threat to children in known materials. Newly
generated material is more likely to indicate
current and ongoing offending, such as
against an unidentified victim who continues
to be abused or a child being groomed and
coerced into producing new abusive images.
The identification of these materials and their
referral to appropriate authorities is time
critical.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Target online grooming and preparatory behaviour</h3>

<h4>Principle 3</h4>

<p>Companies seek to identify and
combat preparatory child sexual exploitation
and abuse activity (such as online grooming
for child sexual abuse), take appropriate action
under their terms of service, and report to
appropriate authorities.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Online grooming is a preparatory
phase in which someone builds trust and
rapport with a child or a third party (such as
their guardian or sibling) in order to gain access
to that child for the purposes of sexual activity.
Online grooming may include offenders
encouraging the victim to engage in sexual
activity or to send the offender sexually explicit
material. It may lead to offenders meeting the
victim, or blackmailing them to produce more
abuse material (for example by threatening to
send images and videos to friends and family).
Offenders may also convince a victim to migrate
to other platforms in the grooming phase to
evade detection.</p>

<h4>Principle 4</h4>

<p>Companies seek to identify and
combat advertising, recruiting, soliciting, or
procuring a child for sexual exploitation or
abuse, or organising to do so, take appropriate
action under their terms of service, and report
to appropriate authorities.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Disrupting preparatory actions such
as procuring a child for sexual abuse is one
potential intervention that can prevent more
serious harm from occurring. These types of
actions are often undertaken by offenders
seeking to obtain greater access to a child
with the intent of committing more serious
online or contact offences. They also make
it easier for like-minded offenders to work
together to enhance individual and collective
access to children for the purposes of sexual
exploitation and abuse.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Target livestreaming</h3>

<h4>Principle 5</h4>

<p>Companies seek to identify and
combat the use of livestreaming services for the
purpose of child sexual exploitation and abuse,
take appropriate action under their terms of
service, and report to appropriate authorities.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Whilst other emerging technologies
may be used to commit child sexual
exploitation and abuse, livestreaming is
particularly complex because it allows
offenders to interact with child sexual abuse
production in real-time and leave limited
evidence. Adult offenders may direct the child
abuse whilst the acts are streamed live to an
audience of offenders. Alternatively, offenders
may entice or coerce children into using
livestreaming platforms to produce child
sexual abuse material. In some cases, a
livestream is captured and distributed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Search</h3>

<h4>Principle 6</h4>

<p>Companies seek to prevent search
results from surfacing child sexual exploitation
and abuse, and seek to prevent automatic
suggestions for such activity and material.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Prevention efforts such as addressing
the avenues used to access child sexual abuse
material are fundamental to ending this
abuse. Searching for child sexual exploitation
and abuse using related terms gives current or
potential offenders an easy way to access child
sexual abuse material. Mainstream routes of
access to this material normalise the process
of seeking it out. Algorithms that suggest child
sexual abuse material could have the effect
of encouraging or inspiring new offending,
as well as increasing revictimisation of those
who are victims of abuse. Providing the user
with details of how to report illegal material
and, when appropriate and where available,
information on interventions for those who
are at risk of offending (for example, providing
links to support services) is also critical.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>A specialised approach for children</h3>

<h4>Principle 7</h4>

<p>Companies seek to adopt
enhanced safety measures with the aim of
protecting children, in particular from peers
or adults seeking to engage in harmful sexual
activity with children; such measures may
include considering whether users are children.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>There are identified risks that are
unique to children online. These include
content risks (which generally position the
child as the recipient of unwelcome and
inappropriate content), contact risks (where
a child participates in risky communication,
possibly unwittingly or unwillingly), and
conduct risks (where a child’s behaviour
contributes to risky content or contact
within a wider peer-to-peer or adult-to-child network). These risks require taking a
considered approach to the safety of users,
which may include efforts to understand
whether users are children when appropriate
and where possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Victim/survivor considerations</h3>

<h4>Principle 8</h4>

<p>Companies seek to take
appropriate action, including providing reporting
options, on material that may not be illegal
on its face, but with appropriate context and
confirmation may be connected to child sexual
exploitation and abuse.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Material depicting child sexual
exploitation and abuse is illegal. However,
certain images, videos, discussions and other
recordings may fall below this threshold but
still warrant action.</p>

<p>Appropriate context and confirmation is
required to demonstrate that material in the
following and other relevant examples is
connected to child sexual exploitation
and abuse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>self-generated materials,</li>
  <li>materials that form part of an abuse series
(and may show content directly before or
after the abuse occurred),</li>
  <li>discussions relating to victims depicted in
child sexual abuse material (including
where offenders are discussing non-illegal
imagery of a victim as a child or an adult),
and</li>
  <li>otherwise innocent materials that have
been misappropriated and used in
connection with child sexual exploitation
and abuse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying and taking appropriate action on
this material can reduce new and ongoing
opportunities for victimisation. For example,
self-generated images can indicate a child is
being groomed and coerced into producing
images, or can be shared beyond the original
recipient causing significant distress to the child.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Collaborate &amp; respond to evolving threat</h3>

<h4>Principle 9</h4>

<p>Companies seek to take an
informed global approach to combating online
child sexual exploitation and abuse and to take
into account the evolving threat landscape
as part of their design and development
processes.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Criminal means and methods evolve
quickly as offenders exploit new technology
to commit online child sexual exploitation and
abuse. To respond effectively to the evolving
threat and changing behaviours, companies
should seek to design their products with
child safety in mind. This includes routinely
reviewing efforts to tackle child sexual
exploitation and abuse, adapting internal
processes and technology, participating in
multi-stakeholder processes to keep up to date
with the threat landscape, collaborating across
industry and considering the privacy interests
of their users alongside safety protections for
children.</p>

<h4>Principle 10</h4>

<p>Companies support
opportunities to share relevant expertise,
helpful practices, data and tools where
appropriate and feasible.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Companies have been working
together, sharing helpful practices, data, tools
and techniques for many years via a range of
collaborative forums and non-governmental
organisations. Companies plan to continue
to expand this collaborative work, sharing
outcomes and outputs across the technology
sector.</p>

<h4>Principle 11</h4>

<p>Companies seek to regularly
publish or share meaningful data and insights
on their efforts to combat child sexual
exploitation and abuse.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>Regular and transparent reporting will
improve available data about the production,
distribution, blocking and removal of child
sexual exploitation and abuse. Combined with
data from governments and non-governmental
organisations, this will result in a better
understanding of the threat and provide
support for ongoing initiatives to combat this
crime. Reporting will also ensure cooperative
efforts between governments, law enforcement
agencies, companies and other stakeholders
are focussed on areas of greatest need.</p>
