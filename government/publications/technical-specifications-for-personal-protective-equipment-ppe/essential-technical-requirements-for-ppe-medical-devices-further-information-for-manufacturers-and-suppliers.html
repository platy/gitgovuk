<p>These <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specifications-for-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">technical specification documents</a> are for new suppliers and manufacturers when they are using the tendering process for the supply or manufacture of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. The guidance is intended to ensure that these parties understand our regulatory requirements and that all products must comply with the stated standards, legislation and/or directives (as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time).</p>

<p>You will need to meet the essential technical specifications, as published here, if you wish to propose through the tendering process the supply of any of these products to the UK to protect NHS patients and health and social care workers from coronavirus (COVID-19) and your proposed product does not have a CE mark, or you wish to propose the alternative use of an existing CE marked product against the following relevant legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if intended to protect the wearer: EU regulation 2016/425 on personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</li>
  <li>if intended to protect the patient: Medical Devices Regulations (MDR 2002) which implements Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices</li>
  <li>if you claim it is dual purpose (MD and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>), the product must comply with MDR. In addition, they must meet the relevant essential health and safety requirements (EHSR) of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Directive</li>
</ul>

<p>The documents set out the essential technical requirements for the named categories of products, including what is ‘essentially acceptable’ in the context of the COVID-19 threat and how to then apply for a derogation to the MDR or regulatory flexibilities for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where new suppliers have current or proposed products that they consider meet these requirements, they will apply the specifications as part of our tender process for national procurement for health and social care settings across the UK. Further detail on that tendering process will be published here in the future but the process is already being effectively used by current and new manufacturers and suppliers.</p>

<h3>Advice on the essential technical requirements</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specifications-for-personal-protective-equipment-ppe/essential-technical-requirements-for-ppe-medical-devices-further-information-for-health-and-social-care-providers">Essential technical requirements for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and medical devices: further information for health and social care providers</a> gives advice to health and social care providers on the essential technical requirements and how these impact any existing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> stocks, direct supply, donation or purchasing which they may now also be conducting or receiving outside of the national procurement model for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>The documents make clear that the essential technical requirements apply to all suppliers or manufacturers. Regulatory approval against the essential technical requirements for production or supply is required before any <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> without a CE mark or being used for an alternative purpose than its current CE mark is used from the individual manufacturer within the health and social care system, including where this has been received as a donation.</p>
