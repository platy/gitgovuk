<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for citizens from all countries outside the UK interested in training to teach in England.</p>

<p>The Department for Education’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student" rel="external">Get into Teaching website</a> gives an overview of the steps to train to teach in England and is a good place to start your research.</p>

<p>You can also get help from a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">train to teach adviser</a>.</p>

<p>You will need the information on this page when you are ready to apply for teacher training.</p>

<p>Different rules about visas and funding will apply to you if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>have settled or pre-settled status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Check <a class="govuk-link" href="#rate">find out about fees and financial support</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#visa">apply for your visa</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>To train to teach in England you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a university degree (UK or non-UK)</li>
  <li>a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in <a class="govuk-link" href="#GCSE"><abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> English and mathematics</a>
</li>
  <li>a confirmed offer of a training place from an English teacher training provider</li>
  <li>an immigration status which allows you to train to teach in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the health and physical capacity to train to teach</li>
  <li>undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks carried out by your training provider or employer</li>
  <li>show your training provider you meet their standards for maths and English</li>
</ul>

<p>The guidance on this page takes you through the process of applying for teacher training, step by step. When you have successfully completed your training, you will be awarded <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status</a> (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>). <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> allows you to teach in all schools in England.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Check your qualifications</h2>

<p>To teach children aged 11 to 18 in secondary school, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bachelor’s degree (this can be from a university outside the UK)</li>
  <li>to meet a standard in English and mathematics equivalent to a grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To teach children aged 3 to 11 in primary school you will also need to meet a standard in physics, chemistry or biology equivalent to a grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16. <a class="govuk-link" href="#qualifications">We can help you</a> show your English, maths and science qualifications are the same standard as a grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>If you do not have qualifications that are equivalent to GCSEs, you may be able to sit a test set by training providers to show your knowledge of English, maths and science. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="#qualifications">contact us for advice about this</a>.</p>

<h3>If you do not have a university degree</h3>

<p>If you do not have a degree, you can apply to study a 3 to 4 year <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucas.com/explore/subjects/teaching" rel="external">undergraduate course in England</a> which combines a teaching degree with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts"><abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr></a>. When you have completed your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.</p>

<p>Visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/" rel="external">UK Council for International Student Affairs</a> for lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.</p>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>)’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a> website contains lots of helpful information about training to teach, and life as a teacher in England.</p>

<p>To get advice, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call +44 800 389 2500, Monday to Friday between 8.30am and 5.30pm (UK local time) – calls will be charged at your standard rate</li>
  <li>use the live chat service on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-teach-in-england-as-an-international-student" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a> website</li>

</ul>

<h3>Get help with international qualifications</h3>

<p>If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your teacher training provider may want to see a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx" rel="external">statement of comparability</a> from UK ENIC. A statement of comparability proves that your school and university qualifications are the same standard as UK GCSEs and a UK undergraduate degree.</p>

<p>Call us on +44 800 389 2500 for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications</li>
  <li>a free statement of comparability, once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this</li>
  <li>advice about what to do if you do not have English, maths and science qualifications of grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> standard</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Find out about fees and financial support</h2>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>Fees vary between training providers but range from about £12,000 to about £22,000 in total. You’ll also have to pay your living costs.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can apply for a salaried teacher training course, and earn money while you train in a school. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. You will usually need to have achieved highly in your bachelor’s degree and have at least 3 years’ relevant work experience.</p>

<h3>Financial support</h3>

<p>You can only get financial support if you apply to a fee-paying teacher training course in England (this means you pay a fee to study, instead of earning a salary while you train).</p>

<p>Any financial support is dependent on your immigration status. You are more likely to get financial support if you have some type of settled status in the UK – for example, through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>. Without settled status, you are unlikely to be eligible.</p>

<h4>Financial support for Irish citizens</h4>

<p>Check your eligibility for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if you are an Irish citizen.</p>

<p>If you meet both the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>you have been resident in the UK, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man throughout the 3 years immediately before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<p>you will generally be eligible for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#maintenance-loan">maintenance loan</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet both the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>you have been resident in Ireland, or Ireland and the UK, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<p>you will generally be eligible for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a>.</p>

<h4>Financial support for applicants from within the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</h4>

<p>Check your eligibility for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if you come from within the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland.</p>

<p>If you meet both the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>you have been resident in the UK throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<p>you will generally be eligible for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#maintenance-loan">maintenance loan</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you meet all 3 of the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>you have been resident in the UK, Gibraltar, the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
  <li>you are an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or a Swiss worker, or a family member of one</li>
</ul>

<p>you will generally be eligible for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#maintenance-loan">maintenance loan</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/information--advice/fees-and-money/government-student-support#layer-6212" rel="external">worker</a> is someone who is employed or self-employed in the UK. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/information--advice/fees-and-money/government-student-support#layer-6212" rel="external">family member</a> is a spouse or civil partner, child and, sometimes, parent or grandparent.</p>

<p>If you meet both the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an EU national with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>you have been resident in the UK, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<p>you will generally be eligible for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a>.</p>

<h4>Applicants from outside the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</h4>

<p>To be eligible for financial support, you must usually have settled status (for example, indefinite leave to remain) and have been living in the UK, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man throughout the 3 years immediately before the start of your course. Exceptions apply in some cases – for example if you have been <a class="govuk-link" href="#refugee">recognised as a refugee</a>.</p>

<h4>Financial support for refugees and asylum seekers</h4>

<p>If you have been recognised as a refugee by the UK government, you, your spouse or civil partner and your children, are eligible for financial support for teacher training.</p>

<p>You will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to have been living in the UK since you were recognised as a refugee</li>
  <li>to be living in England when your teacher training course starts</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are an asylum seeker you will not be eligible for financial support, but if you are recognised as a refugee after your course has started, you may be able to claim financial support to complete your studies.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#finance">Financial support</a> can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help with living expenses (a <a class="govuk-link" href="#maintenance-loan">maintenance loan</a>)</li>
  <li>help with course fees (a <a class="govuk-link" href="#tuition-fee-loan">tuition fee loan</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If, as a refugee, you are eligible for help with course fees, you may also be eligible for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bursary-or-scholarship">bursary or scholarship</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of financial support</h3>

<p>This section explains the types of financial support you can get if you have the correct immigration status.</p>

<h4>Tuition fee loan</h4>

<p>Your tuition fees are paid in full, with the money going directly to your teacher training provider. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2022 to 2023 financial year, this is £27,295 per year.</p>

<h4>Maintenance loan</h4>

<p>Money is paid directly into your bank account to help with your living costs. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2022 to 2023 financial year, this is £27,295 per year.</p>

<h4>Home fee rate</h4>

<p>If you meet the requirements for a tuition fee loan, or tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you will be charged fees at the rate set for UK candidates (up to £9,250 for a full-time course).</p>

<h4>Teacher training bursary or scholarship</h4>

<p>Money is paid directly into your bank account and you can use this as you wish. You do not have to pay this money back.</p>

<p>If you meet the eligibility requirements for a tuition fee loan, or tuition fee and maintenance loan, you may also be eligible for a teacher training bursary or scholarship.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-your-training#bursaries-and-scholarships" rel="external">Bursaries and scholarships</a> are only available in certain subjects.</p>

<h4>Extra financial support</h4>

<p>If you have a disability, children or an adult dependant to care for, and you are eligible for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you may be able to apply for extra help. You do not have to pay this money back.</p>

<p>You could apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas/how-to-claim">Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant">Childcare Grant</a></li>

</ul>

<p>You can search by location, teaching subject and age group. You can also search for courses which pay a salary, and courses where student or skilled worker visa sponsorship is available.</p>

<h3>Choosing a training provider who can offer visa sponsorship</h3>

<p>If you need a visa to train to teach in England, you must have a confirmed offer of a training place on a course offering student or skilled worker visa sponsorship before you apply for your visa.</p>

<p>Many training providers have experience in welcoming international candidates and can offer support. However, due to rules about immigration, not all will be able to accept your application.</p>

<p>If you do not have settled or pre-settled status, or indefinite leave to remain, you should contact your chosen teacher training providers directly before you apply online to get their advice about your eligibility and the application process.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have settled or pre-settled status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>, you can apply to any teacher training provider in England.</p>

<h3>Types of teacher training leading to qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk" rel="external">registered with an adviser</a>, they’ll be able to explain the different types of courses available. You can train in a school or in a university setting, and study full-time (over a year) or part-time (over 2 or more years).</p>

<h4>Fee-paying and salaried teacher training courses</h4>

<p>You can choose to apply for a fee-paying or salaried teacher training course.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-have-a-degree" rel="external">fee-paying teacher training course</a> means you pay a fee to study as a teacher. The majority of students training as teachers in England train on this type of course.</p>

<p>Fee-paying courses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>university teacher training programmes</li>
  <li>school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programmes</li>
  <li>School Direct unsalaried teacher training programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>A salaried teacher training course means you are paid to work in a school while you learn to teach. However, these courses are limited in number and very competitive. You will usually need to have achieved highly in your bachelor’s degree and, for a School Direct salaried course, have at least 3 years’ relevant work experience.</p>

<p>Salaried courses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>School Direct salaried teacher training programmes</li>
  <li>the Teach First Leadership Development programme</li>
  <li>postgraduate teaching apprenticeships</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>to have been living in the UK or the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK</li>
  <li>to have been living in the UK for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>All of the courses training to teach children aged 3 to 19 listed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> lead to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts"><abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr></a>. <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools and is considered desirable for teachers in most schools in England.</p>

<p>Some teacher training courses lead to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and a postgraduate certificate in education (<abbr title="postgraduate certificate in education">PGCE</abbr>) or a postgraduate diploma in education (<abbr title="postgraduate diploma in education">PGDE</abbr>). You do not need a <abbr title="postgraduate certificate in education">PGCE</abbr> or <abbr title="postgraduate diploma in education">PGDE</abbr> to teach in England, but these academic qualifications may improve your employability inside and outside the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is recognised in many countries around the world – check with the organisation responsible for regulating teachers in the country where you want to teach.</p>

<p>You can find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/ways-to-train" rel="external">ways to train</a> on the Get into Teaching website. Remember to get advice from your chosen training provider before you apply.</p>

<h3>Check whether you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>If you are from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a> or Switzerland, you might be able to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living, working and studying in the UK without applying for a visa.</p>

<p>The deadline for most people to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme was 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>If you or your family are from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland, you can still apply if you or a family member were living in the UK by 31 December 2020. You must also either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet one of the criteria for a later deadline to apply</li>
  <li>have ‘reasonable grounds’ for not applying by 30 June 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>More information is available about the eligibility criteria for later applications to the EU Settlement Scheme.</p>

<p>You can also apply to the EU Settlement Scheme if <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/switch-from-presettled-status-to-settled-status">you already have pre-settled status and are applying for settled status</a>. You must apply to the EU Settlement Scheme again before your pre-settled status expires to stay in the UK.</p>

<h3>Apply for a visa for your teacher training course</h3>

<p>You’ll need a visa or other immigration status that allows you to work or study in the UK unless you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>have indefinite leave to remain</li>
</ul>

<p>The main visa routes for teacher training in England are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the student visa</li>
  <li>the skilled worker visa</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be eligible for other visas.</p>

<h4>Student visa or skilled worker visa</h4>

<p>The type of visa you need will depend on whether you are on <a class="govuk-link" href="#fee">a fee-paying or salaried teacher training course</a>.</p>

<h4>Applying for a student visa for a fee-paying teacher training course</h4>

<p>For a fee-paying teacher training course, you will need a student visa. Your visa must be sponsored by a licensed sponsor of student visas.</p>

<p>You can search <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">find postgraduate teacher training</a> for providers who can sponsor student visas. We suggest you contact them to check they can sponsor you before you apply for a training place.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply for your visa if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a confirmed offer of a place on a course with a licensed student sponsor teacher training provider</li>
  <li>have a reference number, called a confirmation of acceptance for studies (<abbr title="confirmation of acceptance for studies">CAS</abbr>), which your training provider will give you</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money">have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english">can speak, read, write, and understand English</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For your offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to be accepted on to a teacher training course, and may also have to pass criminal record and health checks, so we recommend applying to your training provider early.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply">Apply for a student visa</a></p>
</div>

<h4>Applying for a skilled worker visa for a salaried teacher training course</h4>

<p>For a salaried teacher training course, you will need a skilled worker visa. Your visa must be sponsored by a licensed sponsor of skilled worker visas.</p>

<p>You can search <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">find postgraduate teacher training</a> for providers who can sponsor skilled worker visas. Currently, places on these courses are very limited. Before you apply for a salaried teacher training place, we suggest you contact the training provider to check they can sponsor you.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply for your visa if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a confirmed offer for a salaried training place at a school that is a licensed skilled worker sponsor</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english">you can speak, read, write, and understand English</a></li>
  <li>your salary meets the requirement for a skilled worker visa</li>
</ul>

<p>For your offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to be accepted on to a teacher training course, and may also have to pass criminal record and health checks, so we recommend applying to your training provider early.</p>

<h4>Salary requirement for a skilled worker visa</h4>

<p>The salary threshold you must meet depends on the region you work in as a salaried trainee.</p>

<p>This table shows the minimum salary non-UK salaried trainee teachers must earn to be eligible for a skilled worker visa, by region.</p>

<h3>Part-time salaried teacher training courses</h3>

<p>You may be able to train part-time, but your salary must meet the threshold for a skilled worker visa.</p>

<p>There are 2 requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your part-time salary must be at least £20,480</li>
  <li>the full-time equivalent of your salary must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#table">minimum set in your region for non-UK salaried trainee teachers</a>

<h3>Studying and working as a teacher in the UK without a skilled worker visa or a student visa</h3>

<p>This section explains the other visas and immigration routes you can use.</p>

<h4>Graduate visa</h4>

<p>If you are already an international student in the UK, you can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa">graduate visa</a> on successful completion of your degree. To apply, you will need to have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor over the course of your studies.</p>

<p>The graduate visa will allow you to study, work, or look for work in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students) without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher on a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course, if the course does not meet the requirements for a student visa. If the course can sponsor a student visa, you must apply for this type of visa.</p>

<p>You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK, if you meet the requirements for the other visa route.</p>

<h4>High potential individual visa</h4>

<p>To be eligible for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa">high potential individual visa</a>, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree or PhD from a university listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa/eligibility">Global Universities list</a>
</li>
  <li>have been awarded your qualification no more than 5 years before you apply</li>
  <li>have English language skills to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-level/b1-english-level-intermediate#:~:text=Skills%20at%20B1%20English%20level%20(intermediate)&amp;text=They%20can%20understand%20the%20main,organised%20texts%20about%20familiar%20topics" rel="external">B1 intermediate level</a>
</li>
  <li>have personal funds of £1,270</li>
  <li>pass a security and criminality check</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need an offer of a place on a teacher training course to apply for this visa and you’ll be able to stay in the UK for 2 years with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree, and 3 years with a PhD. If your visa application is successful, you will be able to train as a teacher on either a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course, as long as the course does not meet the requirements for a student visa. If the course can sponsor a student visa, you must apply for this type of visa.</p>

<h4>The Youth Mobility Scheme visa</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility">Youth Mobility Scheme</a> allows young people from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility/eligibility">certain countries</a> to come to the UK to study or work without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher via either a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course.</p>

<p>A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the other visa route.</p>

<h4>Other visas</h4>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work or study in the UK on alternative visas – for example, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa">Family visa</a>, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa">UK Ancestry visa</a> or, if you are from Hong Kong, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa">British National (Overseas)</a> visa.</p>

<h4>Refugees and asylum seekers</h4>

<p>If you have been granted refugee status, you can apply for teacher training – either salaried or fee-paying – and will usually be eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="#refugee">financial support</a> to train to teach on a fee-paying course.</p>

<p>If you are in the process of seeking asylum, you should refer to your immigration bail conditions to see if you have permission to study on a teacher training course. You will not usually be eligible for financial support to train to teach on a fee-paying course. You are also unlikely to be able to undertake salaried teacher training while your asylum claim is considered, because asylum seekers do not usually have the right to work, although there are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-whilst-an-asylum-claim-is-considered/working-in-the-uk-whilst-an-asylum-case-is-considered">some exceptions</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Visa fees and other charges</h4>

<p>You may need to pay for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK healthcare as part of your immigration application</a> – this is called the Immigration Health Surcharge (<abbr title="Immigration Health Surcharge">IHS</abbr>).</p>

<p>However, students can usually claim a refund of the <abbr title="Immigration Health Surcharge">IHS</abbr> if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a full-time student in UK higher education</li>
  <li>have a visa starting on or after 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued in an EU country</li>
  <li>do not work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also have to pay visa fees. Use this tool to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visa-fees">calculate how much your visa will cost</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you will usually need to show proof of a certain level of savings or income, depending on which visa you are applying for. You’ll be guided through this process when you apply for your visa.</p>

<h3>Early career teacher induction</h3>

<p>After <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, many schools will require you to complete an early career teacher (ECT) 2-year induction period, when you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in a school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">early career framework</a> for teachers in England, which helps teachers succeed by developing their professional practice, knowledge and working habits.
