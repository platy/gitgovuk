<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To train to teach in England you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a university degree (UK or non-UK)</li>
  <li>a standard equivalent to a grade 4 in <a class="govuk-link" href="#GCSE"><abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> English and mathematics</a>
</li>
  <li>a confirmed offer of a training place from an English teacher training provider</li>
  <li>an immigration status which allows you to train to teach in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have the health and physical capacity to train to teach</li>
  <li>undergo safeguarding and criminal record checks carried out by your training provider or employer</li>
  <li>show your training provider you meet their standards for maths and English</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Check your qualifications</h2>

<p>To teach children aged 11 to 18 in secondary school, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bachelor’s degree (this can be from a university outside the UK)</li>
  <li>a standard in English and mathematics equivalent to a grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To teach children aged 3 to 11 in primary school you will also need a standard in physics, chemistry or biology equivalent to a grade 4 <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</abbr> (General Certificate of Secondary Education) is an academic qualification awarded for exams in England, usually taken at age 16. <a class="govuk-link" href="#help">Get help understanding GCSEs, other English qualifications and their international equivalents</a>.</p>

<h3>If you do not have a university degree</h3>

<p>If you do not have a degree, you can apply to study a 3 to 4 year <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucas.com/explore/subjects/teaching" rel="external">undergraduate course in England</a> which combines a teaching degree with attainment of <a class="govuk-link" href="#qts">qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</a>. When you have completed your studies, you’ll be able to apply for jobs as a teacher in England.</p>

<p>Visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukcisa.org.uk/" rel="external">UK Council for International Student Affairs</a> for lots of helpful information about studying at an English university.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Get help and advice</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>)’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a> website contains lots of helpful information about training to teach, and life as a teacher in England, including details about salaries and benefits.</p>

<h3>Help with international qualifications</h3>

<p>If your qualifications come from a non-UK institution, your teacher training provider may want to see a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://enic.org.uk/Qualifications/SOC/Default.aspx" rel="external">statement of comparability</a> showing their equivalence to UK qualifications.</p>

<p>Call Get into Teaching on 0800 389 2500 for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>guidance on the UK equivalents of your qualifications</li>
  <li>a free statement of comparability detailing overseas degree equivalency from UK ENIC, once you’ve submitted your application, if your provider asks for this</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get an adviser</h3>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://beta-adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">register with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s Get an adviser service</a> for personalised advice about teaching in England over email and phone, and use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a>’s online chat function.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Find out about financial support</h2>

<p>Financial support only applies to fee-paying teacher training in England (this means you pay a fee to study, instead of earning a salary while you train).</p>

<p>International candidates can expect to pay between about £11,000 and £16,000, plus living costs, to train. Fees vary between training providers. Any financial support, including a potential reduction to the home fee rate (which is set at a maximum of £9,250) is dependent on your immigration status.</p>

<p>This guidance is an overview of the eligibility rules. Exceptions may apply in certain circumstances.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You may be eligible to get financial support with your teacher training course if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>don’t fall under the EU Settlement Scheme, but have settled status, for example <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Financial support for applicants from outside the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</h3>

<p>If you are an applicant from outside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea"><abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr></a> or Switzerland, you are unlikely to be eligible for financial support.</p>

<p>To be eligible for financial support, you must usually have settled status (for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a> and have been living in the UK throughout the 3 years immediately before the start of your course. Exceptions apply in some cases – for example, if you have been <a class="govuk-link" href="#refugee">recognised as a refugee</a>.</p>

<p>Further information about exceptions can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies">Student finance: eligibility</a>.</p>

<h3>Financial support for applicants from within the European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>) or Switzerland</h3>

<p>If you have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</a>, you may be able to get some or all of the following types of financial support with your living costs or teacher training course fees known as tuition fees.</p>

<p>Special provisions apply to <a class="govuk-link" href="#irish">Irish citizens</a>.</p>

<h3>Types of financial support</h3>

<p>This section explains the types of financial support you can get.</p>

<h4>Tuition fee loan</h4>

<p>Your tuition fees are paid in full, with the money going directly to your teacher training provider. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2021 to 2022 financial year, this is £27,295 per year.</p>

<h4>Maintenance loan</h4>

<p>Money is paid directly into your bank account to help with your living costs. This is a loan you have to pay back, but you’ll only start your repayments when your income is over a certain amount – for the 2021 to 2022 financial year, this is £27,295 per year.</p>

<h4>Home fee rate</h4>

<p>You are charged tuition fees at the domestic rate (up to £9,250 for a full-time course) which is usually lower than the <a class="govuk-link" href="#rate">rate charged to international students</a>.</p>

<h4>Extra financial support</h4>

<p>You can apply for extra help if you have a disability, children or an adult dependant to care for. You do not have to pay this money back.</p>

<h4>Teacher training bursary or scholarship</h4>

<p>Money is paid directly into your bank account and you can use this as you wish. You do not have to pay this money back.</p>

<h3>Check your eligibility for financial support</h3>

<p>This section explains how to check whether you are eligible.</p>

<h4>Tuition fee and maintenance loan</h4>

<p>You will generally be eligible for both a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if you meet these requirements. You must:</p>

  <li>be an <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or a Swiss worker, or a family member of one</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tuition fee loan without maintenance loan</h4>

<p>If you are not eligible for both a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan then you may be able to get a tuition fee loan without a maintenance loan if you meet the following requirements. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be an EU national with settled or pre-settled status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>have been resident in the UK, <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<h4>Irish citizens</h4>

<p>Special provisions apply to Irish citizens. If you are an Irish citizen then you do not need to have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme as you already have settled status in the UK.</p>

<p>You will generally be eligible for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan if you meet these 2 requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>you have been resident in the UK throughout the 3 years immediately before the start of your course</li>

  <li>you have been resident in Ireland, or Ireland and the UK, throughout the 3 years before the start of your course</li>
</ul>

<h4>Home fee rate</h4>

<h4>Extra financial support</h4>

<p>If you have a disability, children or an adult dependant to care for, and you are eligible for a tuition fee loan and maintenance loan, you may be able to apply for extra help.</p>

<p>You could apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-students-allowances-dsas/how-to-claim">Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA)</a></li>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/adult-dependants-grant">Adult Dependants’ Grant</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to have been living in the UK since you were recognised as a refugee</li>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#finance">Financial support</a> can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help with living expenses</li>

<h4>Fee-paying and salaried teacher training courses</h4>

<p>You can choose to apply for a fee-paying or salaried teacher training course.</p>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/ways-to-train" rel="external">fee-paying teacher training course</a> means you pay a fee to study as a teacher. The majority of students training as teachers in England train on this type of course.</p>

<p>Fee-paying courses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>university teacher training programmes</li>
  <li>school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) programmes</li>
  <li>School Direct unsalaried teacher training programmes</li>
</ul>

<p>A salaried teacher training course means you are paid to work in a school while you learn to teach. However, these courses are competitive and you will usually need to have achieved highly in your bachelor’s degree and, for a School Direct salaried course, have at least 3 years’ relevant work experience.</p>

<p>Salaried courses include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>School Direct salaried teacher training programmes</li>
  <li>the Teach First Leadership Development programme</li>
  <li>postgraduate teaching apprenticeships</li>
</ul>

<p>To apply for a postgraduate teaching apprenticeship you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>to have been living in the UK or the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a visa or immigration status allowing you to work in the UK</li>
  <li>to have been living in the UK for 3 or more years before the start of your apprenticeship</li>
</ul>

<h3>Qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>All of the courses training to teach children aged 3 to 19 listed on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-postgraduate-teacher-training-courses">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> include <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</a>. <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools, and considered desirable for teachers in the majority of schools in England.</p>

<p>Some teacher training courses also include a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) or a postgraduate diploma in education (PGDE). You do not need a PGCE or PGDE to teach in England, but these academic qualifications may improve your employability inside and outside the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is recognised in many countries around the world – check with the organisation responsible for regulating teachers in the country where you want to teach.</p>

<p>You can find more information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/ways-to-train" rel="external">ways to train</a> on the Get into Teaching website. Remember to <a class="govuk-link" href="">get advice from your chosen training provider</a> before you apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Apply for your visa</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you have settled or pre-settled status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/staying-uk-eu-citizen">EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk">indefinite leave to remain</a>, you will not need a visa to train to teach in the UK.</p>

<p>If you are currently studying in the UK on a student visa, you may be able to apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="#gradvisa">graduate visa</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If you’re not sure about your immigration status, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa">check if you need a UK visa</a>.</p>

<h3>Check whether you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>If you are from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a> or Switzerland, you might be able to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living, working and studying in the UK without applying for a visa.</p>

<p>The deadline for most people to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme was 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>If you or your family are from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland, you can still apply if you or a family member were living in the UK by 31 December 2020. You must also either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet one of the criteria for a later deadline to apply</li>
  <li>have ‘reasonable grounds’ for not applying by 30 June 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>More information is available about the eligibility criteria for later applications to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>You can also apply to the EU Settlement Scheme if <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/switch-from-presettled-status-to-settled-status">you already have pre-settled status and are applying for settled status</a>. You must apply to the EU Settlement Scheme again before your pre-settled status expires to stay in the UK.</p>

<h3>Apply for a visa for your teacher training course</h3>

<p>You’ll need a visa or other immigration status that allows you to work or study in the UK, unless you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are an Irish citizen</li>
  <li>have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme</li>
  <li>have indefinite leave to remain</li>
</ul>

<p>The main visa routes for teacher training in England are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the student visa</li>
  <li>the skilled worker visa</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be eligible for other visas.</p>

<h4>Student visa or skilled worker visa</h4>

<p>The type of visa you need will depend on whether you are on <a class="govuk-link" href="#fee">a fee-paying or salaried teacher training course</a>.</p>

<h4>Applying for a student visa for a fee-paying teacher training course</h4>

<p>For a fee-paying teacher training course, you will need a student visa. Student visas must be sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor.</p>

<p>Contact your chosen teacher training provider to check they are a Home Office licensed student sponsor – sponsors can help you apply for your visa. You can also refer to the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students">Register of licensed sponsors: students</a>, which lists all training providers that can sponsor students.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply for your visa if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a confirmed offer of a place on a course with a Home Office licensed student sponsor teacher training provider</li>
  <li>have a reference number, called a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS), which your training provider will give you</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money">have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english">can speak, read, write, and understand English</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For your offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to be accepted on to a teacher training course, and may also have to pass criminal record and health checks, so we recommend applying to your training provider early.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/apply">Apply for a student visa</a></p>
</div>

<h4>Applying for a skilled worker visa for a salaried teacher training course</h4>

<p>For a salaried teacher training course, you will need a skilled worker visa. Skilled worker visas are sponsored by Home Office licensed employers.</p>

<p>You will need to find out whether the school you’ll be employed by during your training is a Home Office licensed employer sponsor. Sometimes it will be the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school">local authority or academy trust</a> that holds the sponsor licence instead of the individual school. You could check the Home Office’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers">Register of licensed sponsors: workers</a>, but you should also check directly with your chosen teacher training provider. Sponsors can help you apply for your visa.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply for your visa if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a confirmed offer for a salaried training place at a school that is a licensed Home Office employer sponsor</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english">you can speak, read, write, and understand English</a></li>
  <li>your salary meets the requirement for a skilled worker visa</li>
</ul>

<p>For your offer to be confirmed, you’ll have to be accepted on to a teacher training course, and may also have to pass criminal record and health checks, so we recommend applying to your training provider early.</p>

<h4>Salary requirement for a skilled worker visa</h4>

<p>The salary threshold you must meet depends on the region you work in as a salaried trainee.</p>

<p>This table shows the minimum salary non-UK salaried trainee teachers must earn to be eligible for a skilled worker visa, by region.</p>

<p>There are 2 requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your part-time salary must be at least £20,480</li>
  <li>

<h3>Studying and working as a teacher in the UK without a skilled worker visa or a student visa</h3>

<p>This section explains the other visas and immigration routes you can use.</p>

<h4>Graduate visa</h4>

<p>If you are already an international student in the UK, you can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa">graduate visa</a> on successful completion of your degree. To apply, you will need to have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor over the course of your studies.</p>

<p>The graduate visa will allow you to study, work, or look for work in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students) without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher on a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course if the course does not meet the requirements for a student visa.</p>

<p>You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK, if you meet the requirements for the other visa route.</p>

<h4>The Youth Mobility Scheme visa</h4>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility">Youth Mobility Scheme</a> allows young people from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility/eligibility">certain countries</a> to come to the UK to study or work without a sponsor. This includes training as a teacher via either a salaried or fee-paying initial teacher training course.</p>

<p>A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the other visa route.</p>

<h4>Other visas</h4>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work or study in the UK on alternative visas – for example, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa">Family visa</a>, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa">UK Ancestry visa</a> or, if you are from Hong Kong, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa">British National (Overseas)</a> visa.</p>

<h4>Refugees and asylum seekers</h4>

<p>If you have been granted refugee status, you can apply for teacher training – either salaried or fee-paying – and will usually be eligible for <a class="govuk-link" href="#refugee">financial support</a> to train to teach on a fee-paying course.</p>

<p>If you are in the process of seeking asylum, you should refer to your immigration bail conditions to see if you have permission to study on a teacher training course. You will not usually be eligible for financial support to train to teach on a fee-paying course. You are also unlikely to be able to undertake salaried teacher training while your asylum claim is considered, because asylum seekers do not usually have the right to work, although there are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-whilst-an-asylum-claim-is-considered/working-in-the-uk-whilst-an-asylum-case-is-considered">some exceptions</a>.</p>

<h4>Visa fees and other charges</h4>

<p>You may need to pay for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/healthcare-immigration-application">UK healthcare as part of your immigration application</a> – this is called the Immigration Health Surcharge (<abbr title="Immigration Health Surcharge">IHS</abbr>).</p>

<p>However, students can usually claim a refund of the <abbr title="Immigration Health Surcharge">IHS</abbr> if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a full-time student in UK higher education</li>
  <li>have a visa starting on or after 1 January 2021</li>
  <li>have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) issued in an EU country</li>
  <li>do not work in the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also have to pay visa fees. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/visa-fees">Use this tool to calculate how much your visa will cost</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you will usually need to show proof of a certain level of savings or income, depending on which visa you are applying for. You’ll be guided through this process when you apply for your visa.</p>

<h3>Early career teacher induction</h3>

<p>After <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>, many schools will require you to complete an early career teacher (ECT) 2-year induction period, when you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in a school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">early career framework</a> for teachers in England, which helps teachers succeed by developing their professional practice, knowledge and working habits.
