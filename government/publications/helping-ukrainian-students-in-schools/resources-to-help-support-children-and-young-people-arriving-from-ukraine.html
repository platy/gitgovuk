<h2>Explaining the education system</h2>

<p>Refugee Education UK has published a&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.reuk.org/welcome" rel="external">welcome booklet</a>&nbsp;to tell parents and guardians about the&nbsp;education system in England so they can help their children or young people access&nbsp;and be prepared for school or college. The first section of this booklet is aimed&nbsp;at parents. The rest of the booklet is for children – to welcome them and tell them&nbsp;what school is like in England. We recommend parents read these sections with their&nbsp;children. There are also some pictures to colour in.​</p>
