<h3>NHS England and NHS Improvement – non-executive directors</h3>

<p>Laura Wade-Gery has transferred her non-executive director role at NHS Improvement to NHS England from 6 November 2020 until 31 July 2021.</p>

<p>Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed has transferred his non-executive director role at NHS England to NHS Improvement from 6 November 2020 until 31 December 2021.</p>

<p>The appointments will continue to involve a time commitment of 2 to 3 days per month. Remuneration for the roles will be at a rate of £7,883 per year.</p>

<h4>Reason for the transfers</h4>

<p>Following an open competition, Laura Wade-Gery was previously appointed to the NHS Improvement board until 31 July 2021. As she has been appointed as interim chair of NHS Digital until 31 March 2021, she had to resign from her NHS Improvement role as this would have disqualified her from continuing as interim chair of NHS Digital. Ministers have directly appointed Laura to the NHS England board for the remainder of her planned term of office.</p>

<p>Also following an open competition, Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed was appointed to the NHS England board until 31 December 2021. For balance, Sir Munir has resigned from the NHS England board and ministers have appointed him to the NHS Improvement board for the remainder of his planned term of office.</p>

<p>The department consulted the Commissioner for Public Appointments on the making of these appointments and he was content.</p>

<p>The appointments are made on merit and political activity played no part in the decision process. However, in accordance with the Cabinet Office Code of Governance for Public Appointments, there is a requirement for appointees’ political activity (if any declared) to be made public. Laura Wade-Gery and Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed have not declared any political activity.</p>
