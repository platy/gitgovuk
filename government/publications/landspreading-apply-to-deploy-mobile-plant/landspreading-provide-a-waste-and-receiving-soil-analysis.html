<p>As part of your landspreading deployment application, you must provide the full analytical results for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each waste stream</li>
  <li>the receiving soil</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect you to get advice on the type and extent of the analysis from a person with the appropriate technical expertise. For example, a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.factsinfo.org.uk/facts/home.eb" rel="external">fertiliser advisers certification and training scheme (<abbr title="fertiliser advisers certification and training scheme">FACTS</abbr>)</a> qualified adviser.</p>

<p>The benefit statement uses the waste and receiving soil analyses to describe the benefits and potential risks from storing and spreading each waste stream to the receiving soil.</p>

<p>For both the waste and receiving soil analyses you must consider contaminants, including the limits for potentially toxic elements (<abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr>). The PTE limits are set to protect animal health and the food chain. You must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice">Sewage sludge in agriculture: code of practice</a> for the PTE limits. This applies to all deployments for any waste type.</p>

<h2>Use an accredited laboratory</h2>

<p>Use an accredited laboratory to analyse the waste and soil samples.</p>

<p>If you are landspreading waste soil you must use the Environment Agency Monitoring Certification Scheme (<abbr title="Environment Agency Monitoring Certification Scheme">MCERTS</abbr>). We recommend using <abbr title="Environment Agency Monitoring Certification Scheme">MCERTS</abbr> for all other types of waste and the receiving soil analysis, but it is not a requirement.</p>

<p>The accredited laboratory must use appropriate methods for sample preparation, analysis and reporting. For example, you can use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitoring-emissions-to-air-land-and-water-mcerts"><abbr title="Environment Agency Monitoring Certification Scheme">MCERTS</abbr></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a laboratory that holds relevant independent accreditation, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/sectors/environmental/" rel="external">UKAS accredited laboratories</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nutrientmanagement.org/what-we-do/support-and-advice/find-a-laboratory/?dm_i=3o4m,v7us,2as4nk,367dk,1" rel="external">Tried and Tested</a> – Professional Nutrient Management and the Soil Association list of providers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Waste analysis</h2>

<p>The waste stream you store and spread must be a single waste with a code and description. It must be listed and match the description in your standard rules permit. If it does not, you need to apply for a bespoke permit.</p>

<p>These are 2 examples of a single waste stream each generated from a single site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>02 02 01 – untreated wash waters and sludges from washing and cleaning from abattoirs, poultry preparation plants, rendering plants or fish preparation plants</li>
  <li>02 01 01 – soils and sludges from washing and cleaning fruit and vegetables only</li>
</ul>

<p>If you mix these waste streams together for ease of storage or spreading, you must list and describe them as separate waste streams in your Landspreading: form LPD1 application for deployment.</p>

<p>You can spread a maximum of 10 waste streams under one deployment.</p>

<p>Each waste stream you list in your deployment application must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>give agricultural benefit or ecological improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be suitable for direct use – no treatment is allowed for example to use one waste to buffer or neutralise the acidic properties of another</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis must be representative of the waste that will be spread. That is, the waste tested is the same as the waste you spread. The analysis must be done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>within 12 months of the deployment application date by an accredited laboratory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more recently if the waste producer has changed any waste inputs or treatment processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>before it is mixed for ease of storage or spreading</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identify for testing the substances reasonably expected to be present in the waste</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>justify the choice of substances for testing, and those not tested</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>select parameters for analysis that are relevant to the waste type</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence of the benefit or improvement the nutrients or properties will provide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know any potential negative impacts and describe them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence of any potential contaminants in the waste that may cause disbenefit to the crop or land</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence that the waste application will not cause build-up of <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> in the receiving soil to an unacceptable level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>describe the type of sampling and analysis done to quantify the concentrations of substances present</p>
  </li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Identify analytical suites and parameters for the waste</h3>

<p>Use these examples of typical analytical suites and parameters that we expect to see in your waste analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>macronutrients such as total and ammoniacal nitrogen, calcium and relevant values for phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, sulphur</li>
  <li>micronutrients such as boron, sodium, manganese</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> or other contaminants</li>
  <li>physical properties such as percentage of dry matter, organic matter (per cent dry solids), bulk density</li>
  <li>chemical properties such as pH, conductivity, neutralising value, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand</li>
  <li>other contaminants such as iodine in blood waste and vanadium in poultry litter ash</li>
  <li>physical contaminants such as metals, glass and plastics</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not prescriptive, exhaustive or a minimum requirement of what you need to analyse for.</p>

<p>You may need a specific waste analysis for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella</li>
  <li>notifiable diseases</li>
  <li>other microorganisms</li>
  <li>noxious weeds, such as invasive species</li>
  <li>carbon to nitrogen ratio in composts</li>
  <li>sodium levels in salty wastes</li>
  <li>stone content</li>
  <li>asbestos</li>
  <li>organic pollutants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins</li>
</ul>

<p>Include any other properties of the waste stream that may affect the soil.</p>

<p>Your analysis must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date the sample was taken</li>
  <li>the sampling methodology and the details of the laboratory that did the analysis</li>
  <li>the test results for each waste stream even if you will mix the waste streams for ease of storage or spreading</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assess results</h3>

<p>You must review the test results to check for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high levels of a substance or contamination with unsuitable waste types</li>
  <li>peaks in sulphur content which can show evidence of plasterboard or gypsum</li>
  <li>peaks in PTE levels such as copper, nickel and arsenic (which can show evidence of treated timberboard)</li>
  <li>peaks in organic compounds which can show evidence of liquid wastes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the following to help you to assess the potential benefits or negative impacts for your benefit statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ahdb.org.uk/knowledge-library/rb209-section-1-principles-of-nutrient-management-and-fertiliser-use" rel="external"><abbr title="AHDB nutrient management guide">RB209</abbr></a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/products/specification-for-composted-materials/standard" rel="external">PAS 100 Specification for composted materials</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published literature</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>professional judgement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When we assess your application, we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use the information you gave us</li>
  <li>use our professional knowledge</li>
  <li>assess it against established standards</li>
</ul>

<p>We may ask for more analysis if we think your test results do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give enough information</li>
  <li>characterise the waste accurately</li>
</ul>

<p>When we approve your application it does not guarantee that using the waste is safe. A new or previously unidentified issue may arise. For example, a new hazard or property not included in your application. It is important to do a thorough assessment. Consider for example, that some materials may be taken up by plants and bioaccumulate in the food chain.</p>

<h2>Receiving soil analysis</h2>

<p>You must provide an accurate and representative receiving soil analysis for each parcel of land you will treat.</p>

<p>The results of your waste analysis will quantify the nutrients it can provide when it is spread. The results of the soil analysis will show the current soil status. By looking at both you can assess which soil properties need adjusting and by how much.</p>

<p>You must use the results to produce the benefit statement and provide evidence of how your analysis allows you to claim agricultural benefit or ecological improvement.</p>

<p>For soil descriptions and guidance on soil sampling see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-how-to-manage-soil-health/landspreading-how-to-manage-soil-health#identify-and-describe-the-soil">identify and describe the soil</a> in Landspreading: how to manage soil health.</p>

<h3>Define the analytical suite for the receiving soil</h3>

<p>The analytical suite must reflect the physical and chemical properties of the soil. It must be specific to your deployment. You can base your soil sampling on your understanding of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the land, such as topography</li>
  <li>its location in relation to groundwater source protection zone 2, groundwater safeguard zone for nitrate, nitrate vulnerable zone and other sensitive receptors</li>
  <li>the soil type, its nutrient status and how likely the concentrations of chemical elements or compounds that are naturally present will increase</li>
  <li>any previous analysis and later applications of waste, sewage sludge, other organic manure or fertiliser</li>
  <li>the past land use, such as previous land treatment, former industrial uses, and the likely presence of <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> and other contaminants</li>
  <li>future land use, such as the next crop and the cropping cycle</li>
  <li>the benefit you are claiming from spreading the waste stream to land</li>
</ul>

<p>Where appropriate, justify any substance or property of the soil that is not analysed for.</p>

<p>You must consider the potential site-specific risks from the waste stream to the receiving soil. These include for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>addition of <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> or other contaminants</li>
  <li>over-application of nutrients</li>
  <li>changes to soil pH that result in increased availability of certain metals</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the type of analytical suites and parameters we expect to see in your receiving soil analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil type and texture, use the descriptions – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landspreading-how-to-manage-soil-health/landspreading-how-to-manage-soil-health#identify-and-describe-the-soil">identify and describe the soil</a> in Landspreading: how to manage soil health</li>
  <li>soil indices for phosphate, potassium, magnesium</li>
  <li>macronutrients and micronutrients</li>
  <li>physical properties – per cent dry matter, organic matter (per cent dry solids) and moisture content</li>
  <li>chemical properties such as pH, liming requirements</li>
  <li><abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr></li>
  <li>other determinands if contamination is suspected</li>
  <li>other crop or land specific requirements, such as those set out in <abbr title="AHDB nutrient management guide">RB209</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not prescriptive, exhaustive or a minimum requirement of what you should analyse.</p>

<p>Use the soil analysis to help you to understand how the applied waste will affect the nutrient reserves and availability as well as the behaviour of any trace minerals and <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> in the receiving soil</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr>, you must consider previous sources that have built up in the soil, such as from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>waste applications to land</li>
  <li>sewage sludge or slurry applications to the land</li>
  <li>past land management and cropping practices</li>
  <li>the deposit of atmospheric pollutants such as historic lead particulates from traffic or other industrial air pollution</li>
</ul>

<h3>PTE limits for soil testing</h3>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice/sewage-sludge-in-agriculture-code-of-practice-for-england-wales-and-northern-ireland">Sewage sludge in agriculture: code of practice</a> for PTE limits.</p>

<p>See section:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>6.3 for PTE limits in soil used for arable farming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6.4 for PTE limits in soil used as grassland</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6.5 for the limits for acidic soils with a low pH</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Limits of detection</h3>

<p>When analysing for <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> you must make sure the laboratory can achieve these limits of detection in mg/kg of dry matter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>zinc – 50</li>
  <li>copper – 25</li>
  <li>nickel – 10</li>
  <li>cadmium – 1</li>
  <li>lead – 25</li>
  <li>mercury – 0.1</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1263/schedule/1/made" rel="external">Schedule 1 of Sewage (Use in Agriculture) Regulations</a> sets out the requirements for testing sludge.</p>

<p>If a previous receiving soil analysis showed <abbr title="potentially toxic elements">PTEs</abbr> to be approaching threshold values, then you will need to provide a new analysis of these parameters.</p>
