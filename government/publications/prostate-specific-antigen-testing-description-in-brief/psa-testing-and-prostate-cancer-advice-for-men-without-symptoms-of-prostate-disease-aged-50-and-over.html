<p>The prostate specific antigen (<abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr>) test is a blood test that can help diagnose prostate problems including prostate cancer. It is not a perfect test. It will miss some prostate cancers, will detect some that would never go on to cause harm and can show a raised <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level when there is no prostate cancer present.</p>

<p>This leaflet provides clear and balanced information that can help you decide if you want to have a <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test or not. Before making a decision, you may want to talk to your GP, practice nurse, partner, family members or friends.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Prostate cancer</h2>

<p>The prostate gland lies just below your bladder. It helps produce healthy sperm. Problems with the prostate gland can affect how you urinate and your sexual function.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/122691/Prostate_anatomy_illustration.png"></div></figure>

<p>Prostate cancer is caused when some cells in the prostate start to grow out of control.</p>

<p>Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in UK men. Each year about 50,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and about 12,000 die from the disease. More than 75% (3 in 4) of men with prostate cancer survive with the disease for 10 or more years. Prostate cancer is rare in men under 50 and the risk increases with age. Most research into <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> testing has been among men aged between 50 and 69.</p>

<p>Slow-growing cancers are common. Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms or shorten your life.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Symptoms</h2>

<p>Most early stage prostate cancers do not have any symptoms.</p>

<p>If you notice anything that is not normal for you, or are worried, you should speak to your GP.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Risk</h2>

<p>You are at higher risk of developing prostate cancer if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are aged 50 or older</li>
  <li>have a close relative, for example brother or father, who has had prostate cancer</li>
  <li>are of Black ethnic origin (double the risk)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>
<abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test</h2>

<p><abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> is a protein that is made by prostate cells. It is measured using a blood test. Most men will not have a raised <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level. <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> levels can be raised in a number of conditions, such as a urinary infection, an enlarged prostate, prostatitis or prostate cancer.</p>

<p>If you decide you want a <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test, you should refrain from sexual activity and vigorous exercise, such as cycling, in the 2 days before the test as they can affect the <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level. Having a prostate biopsy or cystoscopy (where a small tube is inserted into the bladder) in the 6 weeks before the test may also affect the <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Test results and follow-up</h2>

<p>If you have a raised <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level you may be offered another <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test to check if it remains high.</p>

<p>Your GP may then discuss referral to a specialist (urologist) with you. You may have further investigations, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (<abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr>) scan of the prostate. Depending on the <abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr> result, you may then need a biopsy. A biopsy involves taking small samples of your prostate, usually through your back passage or perineum (the skin just in front of the anus), and checking them for cancer.</p>

<p>If further investigations show you have prostate cancer, your specialist will discuss the most appropriate follow-up for you. Regular follow-up (also known as monitoring or surveillance) can be an option for many men who have cancer confined to the prostate gland. Regular follow-up can include blood tests, clinical examination, <abbr title="magnetic resonance imaging">MRI</abbr> imaging scans and biopsies. Other options can include surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.</p>

<p>Treatment options for faster growing or advanced cancers include hormone therapy, biopsies and chemotherapy.<br>
See National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for more information on the management of:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng131/chapter/Recommendations#metastatic-prostate-cancer" rel="external">advanced prostate cancer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects of prostate cancer treatments can include problems with erections, loss of fertility and bowel and urinary incontinence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>The <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test and what the results might mean</h2>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145272/PSA_test_explanation_infographic_new.svg"></div></figure>

<p>Before you decide whether to have the test, think about the information on this page. Talk to your GP about the possible advantages and disadvantages of the test and your own risk of prostate cancer. Having a <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test is a personal decision â what might be important to one person may not be to another and having the test might not be the right thing for you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Possible advantages</h3>

<p>A <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test can help pick up prostate cancer before you have any symptoms.</p>

<p>A <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test can help pick up a fast-growing cancer at an early stage, when treatment could stop it spreading and causing problems or shortening your life.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Possible disadvantages</h3>

<p>You might have a raised <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level, without cancer. Many individuals with a raised <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level do not have prostate cancer.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> test can miss prostate cancer. A small proportion of men who have a low <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level will later be found to have prostate cancer.</p>

<p>If your <abbr title="prostate specific antigen">PSA</abbr> level is raised you may need a biopsy. This can cause side effects, such as pain, infection and bleeding. Not all men will need to have a biopsy.</p>

<p>You might be diagnosed with a slow-growing cancer that would never have caused any problems or shortened your life. Being diagnosed with cancer could make you worry, and you might decide to have treatment you do not need. Treatments can cause side effects which can affect you daily for the rest of your life, such as urinary, bowel and erection problems.</p>
