<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has calculated your 2021 to 2022 and your 2022 to 2023 academic year funding.</p>

<p>When your academy opens you will initially receive a general allocation grant (GAG) statement for the portion of the academic year 2021 to 2022 remaining, from when you opened until 31 August 2022. We base your school budget share for the remainder of the 2021 to 2022 academic year on the 2022 to 2023 financial year local funding formula.</p>

<p>Once your academy has opened, you will also receive a second GAG statement that will cover the full academic year 2022 to 2023 funding period, from 1 September 2022 to 31 August 2023.</p>

<p>We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.
The guide supports your GAG statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we continue to use the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, for high needs and central schools services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the NFF school-level allocations that we published in July 2021 in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023">spreadsheet format</a>  and in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/national-funding-formula/" rel="external">online tool</a> were notional allocations only. In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have continued to set a local formula which has determined individual school and academy budgets in their authority. As in previous years, local authorities have submitted this local formula to us so that we can produce and issue academies allocation statements. Your GAG statement reflects the local formula.</p>

<h3>Who is the guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for mainstream academies and free schools (including studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs)) opening between 1 April 2022 and 31 August 2022, including those with designated special units and resourced provision.</p>

<p>Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/special-and-alternative-provision-academies-and-special-free-schools-open-between-1-april-2022-and-31-august-2022">special and alternative provision academies.</a></p>

<h3>How to use the guide</h3>

<p>We have produced this guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you, or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-open-between-1-april-2022-and-31-august-2022#whats-new-in-2022-to-2023">‘What’s new?’</a> section shows the changes to academy funding in the 2022 to 2023 financial year at a glance, and where the change is reflected in your GAG statement. The subsequent chapters take you through an example funding statement table-by-table, explaining each line in turn. We recognise that GAG funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy.</p>

<p>We have added a section to the end of the guide listing the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-open-between-1-april-2022-and-31-august-2022#funding-outside-the-gag">non-GAG revenue and capital funding lines.</a> It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>Further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocations">academy revenue funding allocations</a> is available.</p>

<p>Further policy information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">pre-16 schools funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023</a> is also available. This includes the operational guidance on schools revenue funding, which sets out the factors that local authorities can use in their funding formula. We have also published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

<h2>What’s new in 2022 to 2023?</h2>

<p>The changes to funding in 2022 to 2023 are summarised below and you can find more information on the technical aspects of these in subsequent chapters.</p>

<h3>Changes to the funding formula</h3>

<p>The key changes to the funding methodology for 2022 to 2023 are set out below. It is important to note that local authorities have some flexibility about how they reflect these changes in their local formula, so you may not see these reflected in your GAG statement.</p>

<h4>Teachers Pay Grant (TPG) and Teachers Pension Employer Contribution Grant (TPECG)</h4>

<p>As Teachers Pay Grant (TPG) and Teachers Pension Employer Contribution Grant (TPECG) are now fully rolled into the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocations, no separate adjustments are needed beyond what was already done in the 2021 to 2022 allocation calculations.</p>

<p>TPG and TPECG ceased from the 2021 to 2022 academic year and, instead, the funding was delegated through the DSG. This funding effectively formed part of SBS allocation. To ensure a like-for-like comparison when calculating MFG, the MFG calculation was required to include an adjustment to the 2020 to 2021 baseline calculation to include TPG and TPECG allocations.  No such adjustment is needed this year.</p>

<h4>Sparsity distance calculation</h4>

<p>The distance pupils live away from their second nearest school is now a ‘road-distance’ measure, no longer a ‘crow flies’ measurement.</p>

<h4>Sparsity distance tapering</h4>

<p>Local authorities have an option to use a ‘taper’ to effectively reduce the sparsity distance thresholds set out in the sparsity section below.  Where applied, a school with sparsity distance less than the main threshold but over 80%, would receive funding, with that funding being greater the closer they are to the main threshold.</p>

<h2>The GAG statement explained</h2>

<p>The following sections of this guide walk you through the GAG statement for the 2021 to 2022 and the 2022 to 2023 academic years. Please note that the figures in the sample tables A to F are intended as an illustration only. They are drawn from a number of different cases to show you as many of the calculation workings as possible, and together they do not represent a single real-life academy.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please also note that the example GAG statement used is relating to 2022 to 2023 however your 2021 to 2022 statement will be displayed in the same way and your funding will be calculated on the same basis.</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary statement</h3>

<p>The first page of your GAG statement is a summary of the tables that make up your GAG. The information used to populate the summary table comes from each of the tables in your pack. Section 2 (high needs allocation) will only be populated if your academy has a designated special unit. De-delegation funding retained by the local authority is only shown in your first statement as this adjustment is only made to those academies that open between 1 May 2022 and 31 August 2022.</p>

<h2>Table A – school budget share</h2>
<p>Table A sets out how we calculate your school budget share (SBS). Your local authority agrees funding factors and rates, in consultation with its schools forum, and supplies these to ESFA using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-complete-the-authority-proforma-tool-apt-2022-to-2023">local authority proforma tool.</a> We apply these to your academy pupil numbers.</p>

<p>Pupil numbers are derived from your autumn 2021 validated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-census-2021-to-2022-technical-information">school census </a>return, depending on the terms of your funding agreement or finance plan if you a free school. However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-open-between-1-april-2022-and-31-august-2022#table-e--pupil-number-matrix">Table E</a> gives further information about the pupil numbers we use in the calculation of your allocation.</p>

<h3>Table A – structure description</h3>

<h3>Factor</h3>

<p>This column shows the names of the factors through which the local authority can allocate funding. There are 3 mandatory factors that all local authorities must use in their funding formula: basic entitlement age weighted pupil unit (AWPU), deprivation and minimum per pupil funding levels (MPPFL). All other factors are optional.</p>

<p>Factors are labelled as either pupil-led or non-pupil-led. Pupil-led factors are driven by pupil numbers or pupil characteristics. At least 80% of a local authority’s schools block funding must flow through pupil-led factors.</p>

<p>However, this may not be the case for every individual school.</p>

<p>Non-pupil-led factors could include lump sum, split site funding, private finance initiative (PFI) and exceptional circumstances. The exceptional circumstances lines will only show on your statement if your local authority has ESFA agreement that it can apply exceptional factors and these are applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This column gives you more information about the basis for the calculation.</p>

<h3>Full year funding amount</h3>

<p>This is the amount the local authority has calculated for the whole of the 2022 to 2023 financial year.</p>

<h3>Part year funding amount</h3>

<p>This is a proportioned amount based on the full 2022 to 2023 financial year amount based on the number of days between the date the academy opened and the end of the academic year on 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>For academies opening before or on 1 September 2022, your second-year statement will be equivalent to the full year amount.</p>

<h3>Total pupil-led factors</h3>

<p>This shows the total of all the pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Total other factors</h3>

<p>This shows the total of all the non-pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Total school budget share</h3>

<p>This is the sum of your pupil-led factors and non-pupil-led factors (excluding rates).</p>

<h3>Percentage included in notional SEN</h3>

<p>Local authorities will have identified a notional special educational needs (SEN) budget in each SBS. This is called notional because it is not a ring-fenced budget and academies can make their own decisions about how much to spend on SEN support given the needs of their pupils.</p>

<p>When planning their budgets, academies should take into account that they must meet the costs of additional support for pupils with SEN up to £6,000 from their SBS (including the notional SEN funding).</p>

<p>The total notional SEN budget is made up of a proportion of various factors included in your SBS, depending on the local formula. The factors included and the proportion attributed to your notional SEN budget allocation is decided locally.</p>

<h3>Funding previously de-delegated</h3>

<p>Funding for services is delegated by local authorities to schools through the funding formula. Maintained schools collectively may then pass back, or de-delegate, funding to the local authority for certain services to be provided centrally, with the approval of the schools forum.</p>

<p>A list of those services for which funding can be de-delegated can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">schools funding 2022 to 2023 operational guide.</a></p>

<p>In order to give the local authority time to plan services, some de-delegated funds are retained by local authorities after maintained schools convert to academy status. In these cases, new academies do not receive the de-delegated funds until an agreed point later in the year. Until this point, local authorities should continue to provide services to new academies where funding is de-delegated, if they are asked to do so.</p>

<p>Academies that open on 1 April 2022 receive all of the previously de-delegated funds from April to August 2022. They will continue to do so in their 2022 to 2023 academic year and subsequent allocations.</p>

<p>Academies that open after 1 April 2022 but before 1 September 2022 will not receive any previously de-delegated funding in the 2021 to 2022 academic year. They will, though, receive all of the previously de-delegated funds in their 2022 to 2023 academic year allocation. For these academies, local authorities should continue to provide services for which funding is de-delegated until September 2022. if they are asked to do so. If the local authority is unable to provide the requested service then they could, alternatively, pay the funding directly to the academy.</p>

<h2>Sample Table A – school budget share 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>The example includes explanations to help you understand your own table A.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Basic entitlement (mandatory factor)</h3>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, the basic entitlement for primary and secondary pupils are £2,000 and £3,000 respectively. The local authority can set different unit values for key stage 3 (KS3) and key stage 4 (KS4) but each of these must be at least £3,000 per pupil.</p>

<p>Local authorities also have the option to apply a reception uplift that is to add new reception pupils starting between the autumn 2021 and January 2022 census.</p>

<h2>Minimum per pupil funding level</h2>

<p>The national funding formula (NFF) provides a minimum per pupil funding value when setting the funding levels for local authorities. These minimum per pupil values have increased for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The calculation of the minimum per pupil funding rate has been simplified to ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups.</p>

<p>The use of the minimum per pupil rate is mandatory, though, in certain circumstances, local authorities can apply to change the rate(s) through the ‘disapplication’ process.</p>

<p>The calculation of the ‘test’ for any uplift for the minimum per pupil funding has been simplified; the option for the local authority to exclude elements of funding has been removed so that now mobility is always included in the calculation and premises (for example, rates, private finance initiative (PFI), split sites) are always excluded.
To ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups, this year we have simplified the calculation for a school’s individual minimum per pupil levels within the NFF. For all schools, we will now apply the following calculation:</p>

<p>((Number of primary year groups × £4,265) + (Number of KS3 year groups × £5,321) + (Number of KS4 year groups × £5,831)) 
divided by 
total number of year groups</p>

<p>This calculation will provide per-pupil funding of at least £4,265 for each primary school, and £5,525 for each secondary school with standard structures of seven and five year groups respectively. For middle schools, all-through schools and other schools with a non-standard year group structure this will produce a specific minimum per-pupil value that relates to the number of year groups in each phase.</p>

<p>The total academy SBS allocation (excluding any prior year adjustment) is divided by the funded number on roll (NOR) (reception to year 11) to arrive at the per pupil allocation for comparing with the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<p>If the academy’s per pupil allocation is higher than the minimum per pupil rate the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is zero. Otherwise, the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is calculated as the minimum per pupil level rate, less the per pupil allocation, multiplied by NOR.</p>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) calculation. Similarly, where they do not receive a minimum funding level allocation, capping and scaling will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<h2>The sparsity factor</h2>

<p>The sparsity factor is derived from the distance that pupils live from their second nearest eligible school. For each school, those pupils for whom the school is the closest eligible school are identified and then the average distance to the second nearest eligible school for these pupils is calculated.</p>

<p>Distances are calculated using as the road-miles distance from a pupil’s postcode to a school’s postcode. This has been calculated using pupil and school postcode coordinates from the autumn pupil level and school level census.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this factor, selective grammar and single-sex schools are not considered when identifying this second nearest school. In addition, pupils living outside of England are excluded from the sparsity distance calculations.</p>

<p>The school size criteria in the sparsity calculation is based on average year group. A school <strong>may</strong> attract sparsity funding if it meets the following criteria, bearing in mind that the LA may select a distance taper which will reduce these average distances:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Phase</th>
      <th scope="col">Average year group size fewer than:</th>
      <th scope="col">Average distance from second nearest school (if taper not selected)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary</td>
      <td>21.4 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Middle</td>
      <td>69.2 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secondary</td>
      <td>120 pupils</td>
      <td>3 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>All-through</td>
      <td>62.5 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Local authorities can narrow the eligibility criteria by increasing the average distance to the second nearest school or reducing the pupil number thresholds. They may not widen the eligibility criteria. Local authorities can determine a sparsity lump sum for each of the above phases, up to a maximum of £100,000 per academy in each case. They can also use a ‘taper’ so that the amount paid to an institution is relative to their pupil numbers. This means the smallest schools receive higher sparsity funding.</p>

<p>Local authorities can apply the NFF methodology, which gives the lump sum to the smallest schools and then applies a taper for those with an average year group size greater than 50% of the threshold.
Where the LA chooses to use the new sparsity distance threshold, mirroring NFF, schools with a sparsity distance between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will attract some sparsity funding through the NFF. This is a change that has been introduced for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The amount depends on both their size and how far away their sparsity distance is from the main threshold. The closer the school’s sparsity distance to the main distance threshold, the greater their allocation and vice versa. Schools with a sparsity distance half-way between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will receive half as much as they would were they equal to or above the main threshold.</p>

<p>Local authorities can also apply to ESFA to include an additional lump sum of up to £50,000 for very small secondary schools in sparsely populated areas. The criteria for eligibility of a school are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupils present in years 10 and 11</li>
  <li>350 pupils or fewer</li>
  <li>a sparsity distance of 5 miles or more</li>
</ul>

<p>If this additional lump sum applies to your academy, it will be shown in the exceptional circumstances part of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-open-between-1-april-2022-and-31-august-2022/#%20table-a-school-budget-share">table A.</a></p>

<h2>Table B – minimum funding guarantee (MFG)</h2>

<p>Table B sets out how your minimum funding guarantee (MFG) is calculated. In your first year of opening this is calculated by the LA. The MFG is a protection against changes in per pupil school budget share (SBS) funding between the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 academic years. The amount of protection will vary according to the impact of local changes in the funding formula and the effect of these on individual per pupil rates.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have the flexibility to set local MFG between +0.5% and 2% per pupil in order to offer higher levels of protection locally.</p>

<p>To determine whether to apply the MFG we calculate and compare the MFG per pupil values for the two academic years. If the change in per pupil funding is less than the MFG rate set by the local authority, then an adjustment is applied to ensure per pupil funding increases by the MFG rate.</p>

<p>Where the local authority chooses to apply capping and scaling, if there is a change in per pupil funding of more than the cap they set, then gains over this cap are scaled back according to the scaling factor the LA chooses to apply.</p>

<p>As the MFG calculation operates at a per pupil level, not on the overall SBS, we do not protect falling budgets caused by a reduction in pupil numbers.</p>

<p>MFG is not calculated for special and alternative provision academies, as these are funded for the number of agreed high needs places.</p>

<p>MFG applies to pupils in reception to year 11, excluding any reception uplift if it is applied by the local authority.</p>

<h3>Exclusions and adjustments</h3>

<p>A number of exclusions and adjustments are applied to the respective SBS to ensure a valid comparison.</p>

<h4>Exclusions</h4>

<p>The funding lines automatically excluded from the MFG calculation are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years funding – this is paid by the local authority and not included in the SBS</li>
  <li>the current year and baseline lump sum – this is not treated as a per pupil amount because, for small schools, the lump sum forms a significant amount per pupil. If it was included in the MFG calculation it would build in excessive protection where a school is increasing its numbers</li>
  <li>the current year and baseline sparsity factor - sparsity is similar to the lump sum in its purpose and therefore including it would distort the protection that MFG provides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any additional lump sum funding received in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, by academies that amalgamated during the 2020 to 2021 academic year, is deducted from the baseline only. Any additional lump sum funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year, for academies amalgamating in 2021 to 2022, is excluded from the 2022 to 2023 MFG budget, but not the baseline.</p>

<h4>MFG exclusions</h4>

<p>If local authorities wish to exclude any additional funding lines from the MFG calculation (from either the 2021 to 2022 baseline funding or the 2022 to 2023 academic year funding) they must make an exceptional case to ESFA. An example of an approved MFG exclusion is where a school would be receiving split-site funding for the first time in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. This exclusion allows the school to receive the full benefit of the additional funding.</p>

<p>Similarly, where a school will no longer be operating on a split-site in 2022 to 2023 the local authority may wish to exclude the split-site funding from the baseline for 2022 to 2023 when calculating the MFG, so that the protection does not include funding for which the school is no longer eligible.</p>

<h4>Technical adjustments</h4>

<p>Local authorities can make technical adjustments to the 2021 to 2022 baseline to make this comparable with 2022 to 2023 funding in certain exceptional circumstances (These adjustments can also be made to 2022 to 2023 to match the 2021 to 2022 as shown in the table below). These relate to changes in delegation, for example, where a budget was previously funded centrally and is now delegated into the funding formula, or where funding has been moved to the high needs block to commission alternative provision (AP) places for schools as well as for the local authority.</p>

<h3>Capping and scaling – affordability adjustments</h3>

<p>Local authorities are able to cap and/or scale back overall gains for schools to make the funding formula affordable. The cap is the limit to which any per pupil gains in SBS can be retained by the school or academy. The scale is the degree to which gains above the cap will be scaled back in the calculation. Local authorities in consultation with their schools forums determine whether and how to limit gains. This must be applied on the same basis to all schools.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 4% cap and 40% scaling means gains up to 4% are kept by schools, and any gains above 4% are scaled back by 40%</li>
  <li>a 10% cap and 100% scaling means all gains above 10% are removed</li>
  <li>a 0% cap and 70% scaling means all gains are scaled back by 70%</li>
</ul>

<p>Your SBS includes all gains before any MFG is applied. Any adjustments made as a result of capping or scaling will appear as a negative amount on your summary table.</p>

<p>Capping and scaling will not be applied to new schools if they have opened in the last 7 years and do not have all year groups present. The local authority may also opt not to use this if they wish as shown below.</p>

<h3>Capping and scaling and MPPFL</h3>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level (MPPFL) allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) module.</p>

<p>Similarly, where an academy does not receive an MPPFL allocation, any capping and scaling applied will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<h2>Table C – post-opening grant (start-up grant)</h2>

<p>Table C will only be populated if you are due to receive start-up grant (SUG) or post-opening grant (POG) funding in the 2021 to 2022 or the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<h3>Start-up grant (SUG)</h3>

<p>SUG is paid to full sponsored academies only.</p>

<p>There are two elements, part A and part B. Part A is a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening. Part B is a formulaic allocation that is intended to contribute to costs, such as leadership, as a new academy grows towards full capacity. It is paid over 2 years for primary schools and 3 years for secondary schools. All pupil or place counts will be agreed at point of opening and will not change for the purposes of calculating SUG thereafter.</p>

<p>The part A rates and the calculation of part B are different for primary and secondary, and for special and alternative provision academies. More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsored academies funding: advice for sponsors.</a></p>

<h3>Post-opening grant (POG)</h3>

<p>Free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) are provided with a post-opening grant to reflect the additional costs in establishing a new publicly-funded school which cannot be met through the general annual grant (GAG). The post-opening grant provides funding in two elements as the free school grows: per pupil resources, paid on a per pupil basis, and a leadership diseconomies grant. These titles reflect the basis on which the funding is calculated, but the grant can be spent on any legitimate purpose of the school.</p>

<p>Free schools established through the local authority presumption route won’t attract POG as the local authority is responsible for the pre-opening development costs and post-opening funding required to address diseconomies of scale until the school reaches full capacity. Further information on POG is available in the guide to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mainstream-free-school-revenue-funding">new mainstream free school revenue funding: 2021 to 2022.</a></p>

<p>The first element (resources) is paid each year that the school builds up to capacity for each new pupil expected to be on roll. The resources element  is calculated at the time that the financial plan is agreed, prior to opening; the post-opening grant will <strong>not</strong> be reviewed on an annual basis to reflect actual pupil numbers. Once awarded, the post-opening grant will be paid in line with the original financial plan.</p>

<p>The second element (leadership) is paid annually based on the number of year groups that the school will ultimately have that do not yet have pupils. The amount is paid to mainstream schools with pupils aged 5 to 15 each year depending on how many year groups (cohorts) are empty.</p>

<h2>Table D – pre-16 high needs place funding</h2>

<p>This table will only be populated for those mainstream academies that have designated special units or resourced provision.</p>

<p>For mainstream academies and free schools, We determine the rate of place funding amount based on occupancy data provided in the Authority Proforma Tool (APT), with the number of places confirmed as part of the place change notification process. The APT is the tool local authorities use to submit their local funding formulae each year. We ask it reflects HN Unit occupancy as at the October census for the appropriate year, and use that to calculate the occupied and unoccupied places to be funded. Occupied places will be funded at £6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Unoccupied places are funded at £10,000. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</li>
  <li>a place isn’t occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled, and requires funding</li>
  <li>spare capacity is required for another reason</li>
</ul>

<p>ESFA confirms the number of high needs places in mainstream academies and free schools with units or resourced provision to fund in 2022 to 2023 as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">annual place change notification</a> process.</p>

<p>This provides a base level of funding. Any additional funding above this level (top-up) must be agreed with your commissioning local authority. Top-up funding is paid by the local authority and is therefore not shown on your GAG funding statement.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023</a> is available. 
For any schools converting to an academy who are outside the scope of the annual place change notification process, place numbers will be determined using high needs and alternative provision (September to March) data.</p>

<p>EFSA must be notified if the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-2021-to-2022">section 251</a> data does not match the place numbers agreed with the local authority.</p>

<p>To inform ESFA of changes, notify the project lead overseeing the conversion to academy. ESFA must be notified of any change before conversion to an academy takes place. If ESFA is not notified of changes prior to conversion, section 251 will be used.</p>

<h2>Table E – pupil number matrix</h2>

<p>Table E shows the pupil numbers used in each of the calculations. The main sources of pupil numbers are the autumn 2021 census, estimates provided by academies and agreed high needs places. Within your allocation the number of pupils attracting the various funding elements may differ. For example, the calculations for school budget share (SBS) do not include nursery pupils.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, occupied places in special units or resourced provision in mainstream academies are included in the calculation of SBS pupil-led factors. These pupils are also funded under the place funding system as described in table D.</p>

<p>Your local authority can opt to apply a reception uplift to your pupil numbers. The pupils counted in the reception uplift are also counted in all other primary pupil-led factor calculations in the SBS. They are not, however, included in the calculation of MFG.</p>

<p>For census-funded academies, pupil numbers are taken from the autumn 2021 validated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-census">school census</a> using single and current dual-main registration at the school.</p>

<p>However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation.</p>

<h2>Funding outside the GAG</h2>

<p>The previous sections explain the elements that make up your pre 16 GAG funding. As an academy you will receive other revenue funding that is not part of your GAG.

<h3>Risk protection arrangement (RPA)</h3>

<p>If you are a member of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-risk-protection-arrangement-rpa-for-schools">RPA,</a> any adjustment made to your funding will be shown on your monthly pay schedule. It is not shown on your allocation statement as it does not affect your allocation, but does affect the amount you will receive on a monthly basis. If you opt into RPA after the allocation was published you will not receive an adjusted allocation statement, but your monthly pay schedule will be reissued. Details of the values for new academies are on the monthly remittance advice notes issued to the academy trust.</p>
