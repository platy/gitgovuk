<h2>Introduction to the general annual grant allocation guide</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has calculated your 2022 to 2023 academic year funding. We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.</p>

<p>The guide supports your general annual grant (GAG) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we’ll continue to use the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, high needs and central school services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<h3>Who is the guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for special and alternative provision (AP) academies and special free schools open before 1 April 2022. Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-open-before-1-april-2022">mainstream academies and free schools.</a></p>

<h3>How to use the guide</h3>

<p>We’ve produced the guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>We recognise that GAG funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy. The section at the end of the guide lists the main non-GAG revenue and capital funding lines.  It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h2>The GAG statement explained</h2>

<p>The following sections of this guide walk you through the GAG statement for the 2022 to 2023 academic year. Please note that the figures in the sample tables A and B are intended as an illustration only.</p>

<h3>Summary statement</h3>

<p>The first page of your GAG statement is a summary of the tables that make up the remainder of your GAG. The information used to populate the summary table comes from each of the tables in your statement.</p>

<h2>Table A: high needs place funding</h2>

<p>Local authorities have a role in funding high needs pupils in academies, as a commissioner of special education provision for these pupils. This means that academies receive funding for pupils with high needs from both ESFA (place funding) and local authorities (top-up funding). In the case of alternative provision (AP) the top-up funding can also come directly from other schools, where they commission places directly. More information about the role of the local authority in agreeing and commissioning high needs places is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

<p>High needs funding for pre-16 special educational needs (SEN) is funded on the number of agreed places.</p>

<p>AP (which by definition is pre-16 only) is also funded on a per place basis.</p>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we will roll forward your 2021 to 2022 academic year place numbers and use these to calculate your allocation. The exception to this is where your local authority has requested a change in place numbers which was agreed with you (or accepted by ESFA where there was disagreement). In this instance, we would use this changed figure in your allocation. More information on this process is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs place change process: academic year 2022 to 2023.</a>
Free schools are out of scope of this process. Place numbers for special and AP free schools will be determined by ESFA based on a range of data including the school’s financial plan, commissioning arrangements and occupancy levels.</p>

<p>Top-up funding above these levels, based on the assessed needs of the pupil and the cost of meeting these in the setting, should be agreed between the commissioning local authority and the special or AP academy. Top-up funding is paid for the period that the pupil is actually occupying the place in the academy. It is paid directly to the academy on a monthly basis unless a different payment frequency is agreed with the local authority.</p>

<p>Top-up funding for pupils in AP can be paid directly by other academies and schools if they commission the places for those pupils. As top-up funding is not paid by ESFA, it is not shown on your GAG funding statement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023/high-needs-funding-2022-to-2023-operational-guidance">high needs funding 2022 to 2023: operational guide</a> for more information on top up funding, including the minimum funding guarantee for special schools at annex 1.</p>

<p>Hospital education places that exist in some academies will be funded at the same rate as in 2021 to 2022, unless the local authority has agreed a higher rate. Pupils occupying these places do not attract top-up funding.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/high-needs-funding">high needs funding</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Sample Table A: academic year 2022 to 2023 high needs place funding</h2>

<p>The example includes explanations to help you understand your own table A.</p>

<h3>Pre-16 breakdown</h3>

<p>Place numbers: for academies: rolled forward pre-16 2021 to 2022 places (or agreed place numbers where a change in place numbers has been requested); for free schools: as agreed by ESFA</p>

<p>Unit value: £10,000</p>

<p>Total allocation = place numbers x unit value</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type</th>
      <th scope="col">Place numbers</th>
      <th scope="col">Annual unit per place value</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Total pre-16 high needs place funding=  Total pre-16 allocation (special) + total pre-16 allocation (alternative provision).</p>

<p>In this example, £ 1,340,000.00	= 1 + 2</p>

<h3>Hospital education breakdown</h3>

<p>Funding per place remains the same as in 2021 to 2022, unless the local authority has agreed a higher rate. It is an amount unique to the academy that will normally have been calculated by the local authority who previously maintained the provision.</p>

<h2>Table B: post-opening grant (start-up grant)</h2>

<p>Table B will only be populated in your 2022 to 2023 funding statement if you are due to receive start-up grant or post-opening grant funding.</p>

<h3>Start-up grant (SUG)</h3>

<p>SUG is paid to full sponsored academies only.</p>

<p>Special and AP academies may receive start-up grant part A. This is a flat rate allocation paid in the first year of opening only: 50% in month one, 25% in month two and 25% in month three.</p>

<p>Special and AP academies do not receive start-up grant B, which is a formulaic allocation for leadership capacity. This is because these academies receive a GAG allocation per place rather than per pupil, which already takes account of staff diseconomies of scale and recognises that pupil numbers in such provision can fluctuate widely throughout the year.</p>

<p>More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsored academies funding: guidance for sponsors.</a></p>

<h3>Post-opening grant (POG)</h3>
<p>Free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) are provided with a post-opening grant to reflect the additional costs in establishing a new publicly-funded school which cannot be met through the general annual grant (GAG). The post-opening grant provides funding in two elements as the free school grows: per pupil resources, paid on a per pupil basis, and a leadership diseconomies grant. These titles reflect the basis on which the funding is calculated, but the grant can be spent on any legitimate purpose of the school.</p>

<p>The first element (resources) is paid each year that the school builds up to capacity for each new pupil expected to be on roll.</p>

<p>The second element (leadership) is paid at a set rate for up to 3 years to Special Schools. Alternative provision schools are calculated on a case by case basis which is agreed with the project lead.</p>

<h2>Funding outside the GAG</h2>

<p>The previous sections explain the elements that make up your pre 16 GAG funding. As an academy you will receive other revenue funding that is not part of your GAG. Some non-GAG funding has not been confirmed for 2022 to 2023 and this section will be updated as the grants are confirmed. Currently confirmed are:</p>

<p>In addition, your academy may receive <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-capital-funding">capital funding.</a></p>

<h3>Risk protection arrangement (RPA)</h3>

<p>If you are a member of the RPA, any adjustment made to your funding will be shown on your monthly pay schedule. It is not shown on your allocation statement as it does not affect your allocation, but does affect the amount you will receive on a monthly basis. If you opt into RPA after the allocation was published you will not receive an adjusted allocation statement, but your monthly pay schedule will be reissued. Details of the values for new academies are on the monthly remittance advice notes issued to the academy trust.</p>
