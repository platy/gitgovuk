<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) has calculated your 2022 to 2023 academic year funding. We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.</p>

<p>This guide supports your general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we’ll continue to use the national funding formula (<abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>) for schools, high needs and central school services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<h3>Who is the guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for special and alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) academies and special and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools open in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. For academies opening within the academic year the funding will be pro-rata accounting for the number of days open in the academic year. Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022">mainstream academies and free schools.</a></p>

<h3>How to use the guide</h3>

<p>We have produced this guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>We recognise that <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy so we’ve added a section to the end of the guide listing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/special-and-alternative-provision-academies-and-special-free-schools-opening-after-1-%20september-2022/#funding-outside-the-gag">main non-<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> revenue and capital funding lines.</a> This section includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h3>Summary statement</h3>

<p>The first page of your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement is a summary of the tables that make up the remainder of your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. The information used to populate the summary table comes from each of the tables in your statement.</p>

<h2>Table A - high needs place funding</h2>

<p>Local authorities have a role in funding high needs pupils in academies, as a commissioner of special education provision for these pupils. This means that academies receive funding for pupils with high needs from both <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> (place funding) and local authorities (top-up funding). In the case of Alternative Provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>), the top-up funding can also come directly from other schools, where they commission places directly.</p>

<p>More information about the role of the local authority in agreeing and commissioning high needs places is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

<p>High needs funding for pre-16 special educational needs (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>) is funded on the number of agreed places, <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> (which by definition is pre 16 only) is also funded on a per place basis.</p>

<p>In the 2022 to 2023 academic year, we will roll forward your 2021 to 2022 academic year place numbers and use these to calculate your allocation. The exception to this is where your local authority has requested a change in place numbers which was agreed with you (or accepted by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> where there was disagreement). In this instance, we would use this changed figure in your allocation. More information on this process is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements: 2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Free schools are out of scope of this process. Place numbers for free schools will be determined by ESFA based on a range of data, including the school’s financial plan, commissioning arrangements and occupancy levels.</p>
</div>

<p>Top-up funding above these levels, based on the assessed needs of the pupil and the cost of meeting these in the setting, should be agreed between the commissioning local authority and the special or <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academy. Top-up funding is paid for the period that the pupil is actually occupying the place in the academy. It is paid directly to the academy on a monthly basis, unless a different payment frequency is agreed with the local authority.</p>

<p>Top-up funding for pupils in <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> can be paid directly by other academies and schools if they commission the places for those pupils. As top-up funding is not paid by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, it is not shown on your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> funding statement. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding 2022 to 2023: operational guide</a> for more information on top up funding, including the minimum funding guarantee for special schools at its annex 1.</p>

<p>Hospital education places that exist in some academies will be funded at the same rate as in 2021 to 2022, unless the local authority has agreed a higher rate. Pupils occupying these places do not attract top-up funding.</p>

<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/high-needs-funding">high needs funding</a> is available.</p>

<h2>Sample table A: high needs place funding</h2>

<p>The example includes explanations to help you understand your own table A.</p>

<h3>Pre-16 breakdown</h3>

<h4>Place numbers</h4>

<p><strong>for academies:</strong> rolled forward pre-16 2021 to 2022 places (or agreed place numbers where a change in place numbers has been requested);</p>

<p><strong>for free schools</strong>: as agreed by <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr></p>

<p><strong>Unit value:</strong> £10,000</p>

<p><strong>Total allocation</strong> = place numbers x unit value</p>

<p><strong>Allocation to August 2023:</strong> (this column will only appear for academies opened within AY 2022-2023) = Total allocation x days open / 365</p>

<h3>Hospital education breakdown</h3>

<p><strong>For academies:</strong> Funding per place remains the same as in 2021 to 2022, unless the local authority has agreed a higher rate. It is an amount unique to the academy that will normally have been calculated by the local authority who previously maintained the provision.</p>

<p><strong>For free schools:</strong> This is calculated by the local authority based on the agreed number of places you will provide. The local authority informs <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> of the relevant amount</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Place numbers</th>
      <th scope="col">Total hospital funding</th>
      <th scope="col">Allocation to August 2023</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Hospital education adjusted for 365 days</h4>

<p>Total hospital education allocation, proportioned from the time you open as an academy until the end of the academic year. This will only appear for academies that opened within the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>Hospital education adjusted for 365 days (01 September 2022 – 31 August 2023).</p>

<p>In this example £5,330,737.93</p>

<h2>Table B: post-opening grant (start-up grant)</h2>

<p>Table B will only be populated in your 2022 to 2023 funding statement if you are due to receive start-up grant (SUG) or post-opening grant (POG) funding.</p>

<h3>Start-up grant (SUG)</h3>

<p>SUG is paid to full sponsored academies only. If your school is a free school these lines will not be populated on your statement.</p>

<p>For academies, there are 2 elements, part A and part B. Part A is a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening: 50% in month 1, 25% in month 2 and 25% in month 3. However, for academies opening between April 2022 and August 2022 this will not apply in the second year of opening.</p>

<p>Special and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academies do not receive start-up grant B, which is a formulaic allocation for leadership capacity.</p>

<p>This is because these academies receive a general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>) allocation per place rather than per pupil, which already takes account of staff diseconomies of scale and recognises that pupil numbers in such provision can fluctuate widely throughout the year.</p>

<p>More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsored academies funding: advice for sponsors.</a></p>

<h3>Post-opening grant (POG)</h3>

<p>Free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) are provided with a post-opening grant to reflect the additional costs in establishing a new publicly-funded school which cannot be met through the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. The POG provides funding in 2 elements as the school grows: per pupil resources, paid on a per pupil basis, and the leadership diseconomies grant. These titles reflect the basis on which the funding is calculated, but the grant can be spent on any legitimate purpose of the school.</p>

<p>The first element (resources) is paid each year that the school builds up to capacity for each new pupil expected to be on roll.&nbsp; The resources element is calculated at the time that the financial plan is agreed, prior to opening; the post-opening grant will not be reviewed on an annual basis to reflect actual pupil numbers. Once awarded, the post-opening grant will be paid in line with the financial plan.</p>

<p>The second element (leadership) is paid annually based on the number of year groups that the school will ultimately have that do not yet have pupils. The amount is paid as a set rate for up to 3 years to special schools. Alternative provision schools are calculated on a case by case basis which is agreed with the project lead.</p>

<p>Special and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free schools established through the local authority presumption route will not attract POG, as the local authority is responsible for the pre-opening development costs and post-opening funding required to address diseconomies of scale until the school reaches full capacity.</p>
