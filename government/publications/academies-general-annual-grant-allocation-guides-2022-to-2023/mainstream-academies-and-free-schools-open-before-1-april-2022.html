<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) has calculated your 2022 to 2023 academic year funding. We have developed the guide in consultation with a sample of academies to make sure it meets your needs.</p>

<p>This guide supports your general annual grant (GAG) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use. You will notice some changes to some of the tables, but we have kept these to a minimum to allow headline year-on-year comparisons.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we’ll continue to use the national funding formula (NFF) for schools, high needs and central school services, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023">NFF school-level allocations</a>  we published in July 2021, were notional allocations only. In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have continued to set a local formula which has determined individual school budgets in their authority. As in previous years, local authorities have submitted this local formula to us so that we can produce and issue academies allocation statements. Your GAG statement reflects the local formula.</p>

<h3>Who is the guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for mainstream academies and free schools (including studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs)) open before 1 April 2022, including those with designated special units and resourced provision. Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/special-and-alternative-provision-academies-and-special-free-schools-open-before-1-april-2022">special and alternative provision academies.</a></p>

<h3>How to use the guide</h3>

<p>We have produced this guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you, or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>The ‘What’s new?’ section shows the changes to academy funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year at a glance, and where the change is reflected in your GAG statement. The subsequent chapters take you through an example funding statement table-by-table, explaining each line in turn.</p>

<p>We recognise that GAG funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy. The section at the end of the guide lists the main non-GAG revenue and capital funding lines. It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>Further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocations">academy revenue funding allocations</a> is available.</p>

<h2>What’s new in the 2022 to 2023 academic year?</h2>

<p>The changes to funding in 2022 to 2023 are summarised below and you can find more information on the technical aspects of these in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>Further policy information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">pre-16 schools funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023</a> is also available. This includes the operational guidance on schools revenue funding, which sets out the factors that local authorities can use in their funding formula. We have also published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

<h3>Changes to the funding formula and your GAG statement</h3>

<p>The key changes to the funding methodology for 2022 to 2023 are set out below. It is important to note that local authorities have some flexibility about how they reflect these changes in their local formula, so you may not see these reflected in your GAG statement.</p>

<h4>Teachers Pay Grant (TPG) and Teachers Pension Employer Contribution Grant (TPECG)</h4>

<p>As Teachers Pay Grant (TPG) and Teachers Pension Employer Contribution Grant (TPECG) are now fully rolled into the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocations, no separate adjustments are needed beyond what was already done in the 2021 to 2022 allocation calculations.</p>

<p>TPG and TPECG ceased from the 2021 to 2022 academic year and, instead, the funding was delegated through the DSG. This funding effectively formed part of schools block (SBS) allocation. To ensure a like-for-like comparison when calculating MFG, the MFG calculation was required to include an adjustment to the 2020 to 2021 baseline calculation to include TPG and TPECG allocations.  No such adjustment is needed this year.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is now no adjustment line in the baseline part of your MFG calculation, as that was required as a one-off adjustment in 2021 to 2022.</p>
</div>

<h4>Sparsity distance calculation</h4>

<p>The distance pupils live away from their second nearest school is now a ‘road-distance’ measure, no longer a ‘crow flies’ measurement.</p>

<h4>Sparsity distance tapering</h4>

<p>Local authorities have an option to use a ‘taper’ to effectively reduce the sparsity distance thresholds set out in the sparsity section below.  Where applied, a school with sparsity distance less than the main threshold but over 80%, would receive funding, with that funding being greater the closer they are to the main threshold.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The sparsity sub-table A1 will indicate if the LA has opted to use this.</p>
</div>

<h2>The GAG statement explained</h2>

<p>The following sections of this guide walk you through the GAG statement for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note that the figures in the sample tables A to E are intended as an illustration only.</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary statement</h3>

<p>The first page of your GAG statement is a summary of the tables that make up the remainder of your GAG. The information used to populate the summary table comes from each of the tables in your statement. Section 2 (high needs allocation) will only be populated if your academy has a designated special unit.</p>

<h2>Table A – school budget share</h2>

<p>Table A sets out how we calculate your SBS. Your local authority agrees funding factors and rates in consultation with its schools forum and supplies these to ESFA using the local authority pro forma tool. We apply these to your academy pupil numbers and associated characteristics. A structure description of table A is below.</p>

<h3>Factor</h3>

<p>This column shows the names of the factors through which the local authority can allocate funding. There are three mandatory factors that all local authorities must use in their funding formula: basic entitlement age weighted pupil unit (AWPU), deprivation and minimum per pupil funding levels (MPPFL). All other factors are optional.</p>

<p>Factors are labelled as either pupil-led or non-pupil-led. Pupil-led factors are driven by pupil numbers and pupil characteristics. Across all the schools in the local authority as a whole, at least 80% of schools block funding must flow through pupil-led factors. However, this may not be the case for every individual school.</p>

<p>Non-pupil-led factors could include lump sum, split-site funding, private finance initiative (PFI) and exceptional circumstances. The exceptional circumstances lines will only appear on your statement if your local authority has ESFA agreement that it can apply exceptional factors and these are applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This column gives you more information about the basis for the calculation.</p>

<h3>Rate</h3>

<p>This shows the rate paid for a particular factor. This is taken from your local authority’s proforma tool. If your local authority does not include a particular factor in its funding formula the rate will show as £0.00.</p>

<h3>Weighting</h3>

<p>This shows the proportion of pupils attracting funding under a particular factor. For example, if the rate is £1,000 and the weighting is 1.0 this means that £1,000 is applied to 100% of your pupil number shown in the next column. If the weighting is 0.50, the rate only applies to 50% of your pupil numbers.</p>

<h3>Pupils</h3>

<p>Pupil numbers are derived either from your autumn 2021 validated school census return or your agreed estimate of pupil numbers for the 2022 to 2023 academic year, depending on the terms of your funding agreement. 
However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate allocations for those funded on census. Table E gives further information about the pupil numbers we use in the calculation of your allocation.</p>

<h3>Sub-total</h3>

<p>This is the rate multiplied by the weighting multiplied by pupil numbers, and shows the funding payable for that factor. If your local authority does not include a factor and or rate in its funding formula, or there are no qualifying pupils, the sub-total will be £0.00.</p>

<h3>Percentage included in notional SEN</h3>

<p>Local authorities will have identified a notional special educational needs (SEN) budget in each school budget share. This is called notional because it is not a ring-fenced budget, and academies can make their own decisions about how much to spend on SEN support, given the needs of their pupils.</p>

<p>When planning their budgets, academies should take into account that they must meet the costs of additional support for pupils with SEN up to £6,000 from their school budget share (including the notional SEN funding). 
The total notional SEN budget is made up of a proportion of various factors included in your SBS, depending on the local formula. The factors included and the proportion attributed to your notional SEN budget allocation is decided locally.</p>

<p>Each factor includes the percentage which contributes to your school’s notional SEN budget. This is shown in the far right-hand column on table A.</p>

<p>Your notional SEN allocation is calculated by multiplying the sub-total for each factor by the percentage indicated in the SEN% column. This gives a notional SEN sub-total for each applicable row. The total of these gives your overall notional SEN allocation. This also appears on the summary table.</p>

<h3>Total pupil-led factors</h3>

<p>This shows the total of all the pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Total other factors</h3>

<p>This shows the total of all the non-pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h3>Total school budget share</h3>

<p>This is the sum of your pupil-led factors and non-pupil-led factors (excluding rates but including any applicable MPPFL uplift).</p>

<h2>Sample Table A – school budget share 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>The example includes explanations to help you understand your own table A.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Basic entitlement (mandatory factor)</h3>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, the basic entitlement for primary and secondary pupils are £2,000 and £3,000 respectively. The local authority can set different unit values for key stage 3 (KS3) and key stage 4 (KS4) but each of these must be at least £3,000 per pupil.</p>

<p>Local authorities also have the option to apply a reception uplift, for example to add new reception pupils starting between the autumn 2020 and January 2021 census.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span> Deprivation (mandatory factor)</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019-technical-report">Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI)</a> measures the proportion of children under the age of 16 that live in low-income households in the local area.</p>

<p>Your local authority formula can use any combination of IDACI categories and/or free school meals and Ever6 data to allocate its deprivation funding. A separate rate can be paid for each of the 6 categories in the IDACI index, and for the primary and secondary phases.</p>

<h4>Secondary low attainment</h4>

<p>For secondary pupils, funding is targeted at all pupils who did not achieve the expected standard at either reading or writing or maths at Key Stage 2. Due to coronavirus (COVID-19), and following the cancellation or incompleteness of assessments in summer 2020 and summer 2021, local authorities will use 2019 assessment data as a proxy for assessments which would have taken place in 2020 and 2021.</p>

<p>The same national weighting of 64.53% for pupils in year 9 will therefore also be used for those who are years 7 and 8 in the academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Sparsity (optional factor)</h3>

<p>A fixed or a variable amount may be applied to small schools and academies where the average distance to a pupil’s second nearest school is more than 2 miles (primary) or 3 miles (secondary).This distance threshold is effectively reduced by 20% if the LA chooses to use the new Distance Taper option.</p>

<p>To be eligible the average year group size  must also be below the specified threshold for its phase. 
The maximum value for the sparsity factor is £100,000 per school (including fringe uplift).</p>

<p>Local authorities can make an application to ESFA to include an exceptional factor of up to £50,000 for very small sparse secondary schools.

To qualify as ‘exceptional’ these factors must normally affect fewer than 5% of schools (including academies) in the authority and the cost for the academy must normally exceed 1% of their budget.</p>

<p>Note that these exceptional circumstances lines will only appear in table A if your local authority has an approved exceptional factor and it applies to your academy.</p>

<h2>Sample Table A.1 – sparsity data</h2>

<p>The local authority can apply a single lump sum or a tapered amount related to school size. If they have applied a single lump sum, it will say ‘fixed’; if a tapered amount is applied it will say ‘tapered’. Local authorities can also use the NFF formula for sparsity. If this is the case then this box will say ‘NFF’.</p>

<p>The sparsity distance is produced by identifying those pupils for whom the school is their nearest eligible school and then calculating the average distance to the second nearest eligible school for these pupils. Distances are calculated using the road miles from a pupil’s postcode to a school’s postcode.</p>

<h2>Minimum per pupil funding level</h2>

<p>The national funding formula (NFF) provides a minimum per pupil funding value when setting the funding levels for local authorities. These minimum per pupil values have increased for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The calculation of the minimum per pupil funding rate has been simplified to ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups.</p>

<p>The use of the minimum per pupil rate has also been made mandatory, though, in certain circumstances, LAs can apply to change the rate(s) through the ‘disapplication’ process.</p>

<p>The calculation of the ‘test’ for any uplift for the minimum per pupil funding has been simplified; the option for the local authority to exclude elements of funding has been removed so that now mobility is always included in the calculation and premises (rates, PFI, split sites for example) always excluded.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups, this year we have simplified the calculation for a school’s individual minimum per-pupil levels within the NFF. For all schools, we will now apply the following calculation:</p>

<p>((Number of primary year groups × £4,265) + (Number of KS3 year groups × £5,321) + (Number of KS4 year groups × £5,831)) 
divided by 
Total number of year groups</p>

<p>This calculation will provide per-pupil funding of at least £4,265 for each primary school, and £5,525 for each secondary school with standard structures of seven and five year groups respectively. For middle schools, all-through schools and other schools with a non-standard year group structure this will produce a specific minimum per-pupil value that relates to the number of year groups in each phase.</p>

<p>The total academy allocation (less excluded factors mentioned above) is divided by the funded number on roll (NOR) (reception to year 11) to arrive at the per pupil allocation for comparing with the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<p>If the academy’s per pupil allocation is higher than the minimum per pupil rate the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is zero. Otherwise, the minimum per pupil funding level allocation is calculated as the minimum per pupil level rate, less the per pupil allocation, multiplied by NOR.</p>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) calculation. Similarly, where they do not receive a minimum funding level allocation, capping and scaling will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<p>Further details are included in the MFG section.</p>

<h2>The sparsity factor</h2>

<p>The sparsity factor is derived from the distance that pupils live from their second nearest eligible school. For each school, those pupils for whom the school is the closest eligible school are identified and then the average distance to the second nearest eligible school for these pupils is calculated.</p>

<p>Distances are calculated using as the road-miles distance from a pupil’s postcode to a school’s postcode. This has been calculated using pupil and school postcode coordinates from the autumn pupil level and school level census.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this factor, selective grammar and single-sex schools are not considered when identifying this second nearest school. In addition, pupils living outside of England are excluded from the sparsity distance calculations.</p>

<p>The school size criteria in the sparsity calculation is based on average year group. A school may attract sparsity funding if it meets the following criteria, bearing in mind that the LA may select a distance taper which will reduce these average distances:-</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Phase</th>
      <th scope="col">Average year group size fewer than:</th>
      <th scope="col">Average distance from second nearest school (if taper not selected)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary</td>
      <td>21.4 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Middle</td>
      <td>69.2 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>

      <td>Secondary</td>

      <td>3 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>All-through</td>
      <td>62.5 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Local authorities can narrow the eligibility criteria by increasing the average distance to the second nearest school or reducing the pupil number thresholds. They may not widen the eligibility criteria. Local authorities can determine a sparsity lump sum for each of the above phases, up to a maximum of £100,000 per academy in each case. They can also use a ‘taper’ so that the amount paid to an institution is relative to their pupil numbers. This means the smallest schools receive higher sparsity funding.</p>

<p>Local authorities can apply the NFF methodology, which gives the lump sum to the smallest schools and then applies a taper for those with an average year group size greater than 50% of the threshold.</p>

<p>Where the LA chooses to use the new sparsity distance threshold, mirroring NFF, schools with a sparsity distance between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will attract some sparsity funding through the NFF. This is a change that has been introduced for 2022 to 2023. The amount depends on both their size and how far away their sparsity distance is from the main threshold. The closer the school’s sparsity distance to the main distance threshold, the greater their allocation and vice versa. Schools with a sparsity distance half-way between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will receive half as much as they would were they equal to or above the main threshold.</p>

<p>Local authorities can also apply to ESFA to include an additional lump sum of up to £50,000 for very small secondary schools in sparsely populated areas. The criteria for eligibility of a school are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupils present in years 10 and 11</li>
  <li>350 pupils or fewer</li>
  <li>a sparsity distance of 5 miles or more</li>
</ul>

<p>If this additional lump sum applies to your academy, it will be shown in the exceptional circumstances part of table A.</p>

<h2>Table B – minimum funding guarantee (MFG)</h2>

<p>Table B sets out how your minimum funding guarantee (MFG) is calculated. The MFG is a protection against changes in per pupil school budget share (SBS) funding between the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 academic years. The amount of protection will vary according to the impact of local changes in the funding formula and the effect of these on individual per pupil rates.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have the flexibility to set local MFG between +0.5% and 2% per pupil in order to offer higher levels of protection locally.</p>

<p>To determine whether to apply the MFG, we calculate and compare the MFG per pupil values for the two academic years. If the change in per pupil funding is less than the MFG rate set by the local authority, then an adjustment is applied to ensure per pupil funding increases by the MFG rate.</p>

<p>Where the local authority chooses to apply capping and scaling, if there is a change in per pupil funding of more than the cap they set, then gains over this cap are scaled back according to the scaling factor the LA chooses to apply.</p>

<p>As the MFG calculation operates at a per pupil level, not on the overall SBS, we do not protect falling budgets caused by a reduction in pupil numbers.</p>

<p>MFG is not calculated for special and alternative provision academies, as these are funded for the number of agreed high needs places.</p>

<p>MFG applies to pupils in reception to year 11, excluding any reception uplift if it is applied by the local authority.</p>

<h3>Exclusions and adjustments</h3>

<p>A number of exclusions and adjustments are applied to the respective SBS to ensure a valid comparison.</p>

<h4>Exclusions</h4>

<p>The funding lines automatically excluded from the MFG calculation are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years funding – this is paid by the local authority and not included in the SBS</li>
  <li>the current year and baseline lump sum – this is not treated as a per pupil amount because, for small schools, the lump sum forms a significant amount per pupil. If it was included in the MFG calculation it would build in excessive protection where a school is increasing its numbers</li>
  <li>the current year and baseline sparsity factor - sparsity is similar to the lump sum in its purpose and therefore including it would distort the protection that MFG provides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any additional lump sum funding received in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, by academies that amalgamated during the 2020 to 2021 academic year, is deducted from the baseline only. Any additional lump sum funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year, for academies amalgamating in 2021 to 2022, is excluded from the 2022 to 2023 MFG budget, but not the baseline.</p>

<h4>MFG exclusions</h4>

<p>If local authorities wish to exclude any additional funding lines from the MFG calculation (from either the 2021 to 2022 baseline funding or the 2022 to 2023 academic year funding) they must make an exceptional case to ESFA. An example of an approved MFG exclusion is where a school would be receiving split-site funding for the first time in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. This exclusion allows the school to receive the full benefit of the additional funding.</p>

<p>Similarly, where a school will no longer be operating on a split-site in 2022 to 2023 the local authority may wish to exclude the split-site funding from the baseline for 2022 to 2023 when calculating the MFG, so that the protection does not include funding for which the school is no longer eligible.</p>

<h4>Technical adjustments</h4>

<p>Local authorities can make technical adjustments to the 2021 to 2022 baseline to make this comparable with 2022 to 2023 funding in certain exceptional circumstances (These adjustments can also be made to 2022 to 2023 to match the 2021 to 2022 as shown in the table below). These relate to changes in delegation, for example, where a budget was previously funded centrally and is now delegated into the funding formula, or where funding has been moved to the high needs block to commission alternative provision (AP) places for schools as well as for the local authority.</p>

<h3>Capping and scaling – affordability adjustments</h3>

<p>Local authorities are able to cap and/or scale back overall gains for schools to make the funding formula affordable. The cap is the limit to which any per pupil gains in SBS can be retained by the school or academy.</p>

<p>The scale is the degree to which gains above the cap will be scaled back in the calculation. Local authorities in consultation with their schools forums determine whether and how to limit gains. This must be applied on the same basis to all schools and academies.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 4% cap and 40% scaling means gains up to 4% are kept by schools, and any gains above 4% are scaled back by 40%</li>
  <li>a 10% cap and 100% scaling means all gains above 10% are removed</li>
  <li>a 0% cap and 70% scaling means all gains are scaled back by 70%</li>
</ul>

<p>Your SBS includes all gains before any MFG is applied. Any adjustments made as a result of capping or scaling will appear as a negative amount on your summary table.</p>

<p>Capping and scaling will not be applied to new schools if they have opened in the last 7 years and do not have all year groups present. The LA may also opt not to use this if they wish as shown below.</p>

<h3>Capping and scaling and MPPFL</h3>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level (MPPFL) allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the minimum funding guarantee (MFG) module.</p>

<p>Similarly, where an academy does not receive an MPPFL allocation, any capping and scaling applied will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<h4>2. Lump sum</h4>

<p>The lump sum for the 2022 to 2023 academic year is removed from the SBS in both funding years to allow for a year-on-year comparison of per pupil funding.

<h4>11. Lump sum (including fringe) in local authorities funding formula</h4>

<p>The lump sum for the 2022 to 2023 academic year is removed from the SBS in both funding years to allow for a year-on-year comparison of per pupil funding. This is because some authorities will have a different lump sum between the two years, and excluding different amounts in each of those years would distort (either excessively or inadequately) the protection that MFG provides.</p>

<h2>Table C – post-opening grant (start-up grant)</h2>

<p>Table C will only be populated if you are due to receive start-up grant or post-opening grant funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<h3>Start-up grant (SUG)</h3>

<p>SUG is paid to full sponsored academies only.</p>

<p>There are two elements, part A and part B. Part A is a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening. Part B is a formulaic allocation that is intended to contribute to costs, such as leadership, as a new academy grows towards full capacity. It is paid over 2 years for primary schools and 3 years for secondary schools. All pupil or place counts will be agreed at point of opening and will not change for the purposes of calculating SUG thereafter.</p>

<p>The part A rates and the calculation of part B are different for primary and secondary, and for special and alternative provision academies. More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsored academies funding: advice for sponsors.</a></p>

<h3>Post-opening grant (POG)</h3>

<p>Free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs) are provided with a post-opening grant to reflect the additional costs in establishing a new publicly-funded school which cannot be met through the general annual grant (GAG). The post-opening grant provides funding in two elements as the free school grows: per pupil resources, paid on a per pupil basis, and a leadership diseconomies grant. These titles reflect the basis on which the funding is calculated, but the grant can be spent on any legitimate purpose of the school.</p>

<p>The first element (resources) is paid each year that the school builds up to capacity for each new pupil expected to be on roll. The resources element  is calculated at the time that the financial plan is agreed, prior to opening; the post-opening grant will not be reviewed on an annual basis to reflect actual pupil numbers. Once awarded, the post-opening grant will be paid in line with the original financial plan.</p>

<p>The second element (leadership) is paid annually based on the number of year groups that the school will ultimately have that do not yet have pupils. The amount is paid to mainstream schools with pupils aged 5 to 15 each year depending on how many year groups (cohorts) are empty.</p>

<h2>Table D – pre-16 high needs place funding</h2>

<p>This table will only be populated for those mainstream academies that have designated special units or resourced provision.</p>

<p>For mainstream academies and free schools, We determine the rate of place funding amount based on occupancy data provided in the Authority Proforma Tool (APT), with the number of places confirmed as part of the place change notification process. The APT is the tool local authorities use to submit their local funding formulae each year. We ask it reflects HN Unit occupancy as at the October census for the appropriate year, and use that to calculate the occupied and unoccupied places to be funded. Occupied places will be funded at £6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Unoccupied places are funded at £10,000. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</li>
  <li>a place isn’t occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled, and requires funding</li>
  <li>spare capacity is required for another reason</li>
</ul>

<p>We confirm the number of high needs places in mainstream academies and free schools with units or resourced provision to fund in 2022 to 2023 as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">annual place change notification</a> process.</p>

<p>This provides a base level of funding. Any additional funding above this level (top-up) must be agreed with your commissioning local authority. Top-up funding is paid by the local authority and is therefore not shown on your GAG funding statement.</p>

<p>Table E shows the pupil numbers used in each of the calculations. The main sources of pupil numbers are the autumn 2021 census, estimates provided by academies and agreed high needs places. Within your allocation, the number of pupils attracting the various funding elements may differ. For example, the calculations for school budget share (SBS) do not include nursery pupils.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, occupied places in special units or resourced provision in mainstream academies are included in the calculation of SBS pupil-led factors. These pupils are also funded under the place funding system as described in table D.</p>

<p>Your local authority can opt to apply a reception uplift to your pupil numbers. The pupils counted in the reception uplift are also counted in all other primary pupil-led factor calculations in the SBS. They are not, however, included in the calculation of MFG.</p>

<p>For census-funded academies, pupil numbers are taken from the autumn 2021 validated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-census">school census</a> using single and current dual-main registration at the school.</p>

<p>However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation.</p>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates">academies funded on estimates</a> pupil numbers are drawn from the final validated revenue funding data collection (RFDC) dataset.</p>

<h3>Risk protection arrangement (RPA)</h3>

<p>If you are a member of the RPA, any adjustment made to your funding will be shown on your monthly pay schedule. It is not shown on your allocation statement as it does not affect your allocation, but does affect the amount you will receive on a monthly basis. If you opt into RPA after the allocation was published you will not receive an adjusted allocation statement, but your monthly pay schedule will be reissued. Details of the values for new academies are on the monthly remittance advice notes issued to the academy trust.</p>
