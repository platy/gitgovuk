<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This operational guide helps you understand how the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>) has calculated your 2022 to 2023 academic year funding.</p>

<p>This guide supports your general annual grant (<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>) statement. It sets out the funding you will receive, how we have calculated it, the factors that have been applied and the source of the data we use.</p>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, we have continued to use the national funding formula (<abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>) for schools and for high needs, to allocate budgets to local authorities.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023"><abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> school-level allocations</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/national-funding-formula/" rel="external">online tool</a> we published in October 2021 were <strong>notional allocations only.</strong> In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have continued to set a local formula which has determined individual school budgets in their authority. As in previous years, local authorities have submitted this local formula to us so that we can produce and issue academies allocation statements. Your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement reflects the local formula.</p>

<h3>Who is the guide for?</h3>

<p>This guide is for mainstream academies and free schools (including university technical colleges (UTCs) and studio schools) opening between 1 September 2022 and 31 March 2023, including those with designated special units and resourced provision. Separate guidance is available for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/special-and-alternative-provision-academies-and-special-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022">special and alternative provision academies.</a></p>

<h3>How to use the guide</h3>

<p>We have produced this guide in a format that allows you to easily access the specific parts that interest you, or areas where you require more detailed information.</p>

<p>The sections take you through an example funding statement table by table, explaining each line in turn, where there are differences between a mainstream academy and a free school these will be explained.</p>

<p>We recognise that <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> funding makes up only part of the overall funding for your academy. The section at the end of the guide lists the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022/#funding-outside-the-GAG">non-<abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> revenue and capital funding lines.</a> It includes links to information about how and when these are paid.</p>

<h3>Further information</h3>

<p>Further information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funding-allocations">academy revenue funding allocations</a> is available.</p>

<h2>What’s new in 2022 to 2023?</h2>

<p>The changes to funding in 2022 to 2023 are summarised below and you can find more information on the technical aspects of these in subsequent sections..</p>

<p>Further policy information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">pre-16 schools funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023</a> is also available. This includes the operational guidance on schools revenue funding, which sets out the factors that local authorities can use in their funding formula. We have also published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023.</a></p>

<h3>Changes to the funding formula</h3>

<p>The key changes to the funding methodology for 2022 to 2023 are set out below. It is important to note that local authorities have some flexibility about how they reflect these changes in their local formula, so you may not see these reflected in your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement.</p>

<h4>Teachers Pay Grant (TPG) and Teachers Pension Employer Contribution Grant (TPECG)</h4>

<p>As TPG and TPECG are now fully rolled into the dedicated schools grant (<abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr>) allocations, no separate adjustments are needed beyond what was already done in the 2021 to 2022 allocation calculations.</p>

<p>TPG and TPECG ceased from the 2021 to 2022 academic year and, instead, the funding was delegated through the <abbr title="dedicated schools grant">DSG</abbr>. This funding effectively formed part of the schools block (SBS) allocation. To ensure a like-for-like comparison when calculating minimum funding guarantee (<abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr>), the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation was required to include an adjustment to the 2020 to 2021 baseline calculation to include TPG and TPECG allocations. No such adjustment is needed this year.</p>

<h4>Sparsity distance calculation</h4>

<p>The distance pupils live away from their second nearest school is now a ‘road-distance’ measure, no longer a ‘crow flies’ measurement.</p>

<h4>Sparsity distance tapering</h4>

<p>Local authorities have an option to use a ‘taper’ to effectively reduce the sparsity distance thresholds set out in the sparsity section below. Where applied, a school with sparsity distance less than the main threshold but over 80%, would receive funding, with that funding being greater the closer they are to the main threshold.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement explained</h2>

<p>The following sections of this guide walk you through the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement for the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note that the figures in the sample tables A to E are intended as an illustration only.</p>
</div>

<h3>Summary statement</h3>

<p>The first page of your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement is a summary of the tables that make up your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. The information used to populate the summary table comes from each of the tables in your statement. Section 2 (high needs allocation) will only be populated if your academy has a designated special unit. De-delegation funding retained by the local authority is only made to mainstream academies that open between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023.</p>

<h2>Table A – school budget share</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022/#sample-table-a-%20school-budget-share">Table A</a> sets out how we calculate your SBS. Your local authority agrees funding factors and rates in consultation with its schools forum and supplies these to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-complete-the-authority-proforma-tool-apt-2022-to-2023">local authority proforma tool.</a> We apply these to your academy pupil numbers.</p>

<p>Pupil numbers are derived either from your autumn 2021 validated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/education/school-censuses-and-slasc">school census</a> return or your agreed estimate of pupil numbers for the 2022 to 2023 academic year, depending on the terms of your funding agreement. However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers through their authority proforma tool (for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022/#table-e-pupil-number-matrix">Table E</a> gives further information about the pupil numbers we use in the calculation of your allocation.</p>

<p>For free schools, your pupil numbers will be taken from the finance plans in the first year of opening.</p>

<p>We do not make a deduction to your SBS pupil numbers for high needs places. Instead, we determine the SBS based on the total number of pupils on roll, including those in the special unit or resourced provision.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There are 3 mandatory factors that all local authorities must use in their funding formula: basic entitlement age weighted pupil unit (AWPU), deprivation, and minimum per pupil funding levels (<abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr>). All other factors are optional.</p>

<p>Factors are labelled as either pupil-led or non-pupil-led. Pupil-led factors are driven by pupil numbers or pupil characteristics. At least 80% of a local authority’s schools block funding must flow through pupil-led factors. However, this may not be the case for every individual school.</p>

<p>Non-pupil-led factors could include lump sum, split-site funding, private finance initiative (PFI) and exceptional circumstances.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The exceptional circumstances lines will only appear on your statement if your local authority has ESFA agreement that it can apply exceptional factors and these are applicable to your academy.</p>
</div>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>This column gives you more information about the basis for the calculation.</p>

<h4>Full year funding amount</h4>

<p>For mainstream academies this is the amount the local authority has calculated for the 2022 to 2023 financial year. For free schools in your first year, this is the amount that has been calculated from your finance plan.</p>

<h4>Part year funding amount</h4>

<p>This is a proportion of the full 2022 to 2023 financial year amount calculated by the local authority. It is based on the number of days between the date the academy opened and the end of the academic year on 31 August 2023. The heading will be adapted according to the opening date of the academy. For academies opening on 1 September 2022, this will be equivalent to the full year funding amount.</p>

<h4>Total pupil-led factors</h4>

<p>This shows the total of all the pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h4>Total other factors</h4>

<p>This shows the total of all the non-pupil-led factors applicable to your academy.</p>

<h4>Total school budget share</h4>

<p>This is the sum of your pupil-led factors and non-pupil-led factors (excluding rates but including any applicable <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> uplift).</p>

<h4>Percentage included in notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Local authorities will have identified a notional special educational needs (<abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr>) budget in each SBS. This is called notional because it is not a separate budget and academies can make their own decisions about how much to spend on <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> support given the needs of their pupils.</p>

<p>When planning their budgets, academies should take into account that they must meet the costs of additional support for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> up to £6,000 from their SBS (including the notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> funding).</p>

<p>The total notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget is made up of a proportion of various factors included in your SBS, depending on the local formula. The factors included and the proportion attributed to your notional <abbr title="special educational needs">SEN</abbr> budget allocation is decided locally.</p>

<h4>Funding previously de-delegated</h4>

<p>Funding for services is delegated by local authorities to schools through the funding formula. Maintained schools collectively may then pass back, or de-delegate, funding to the local authority for certain services to be provided centrally, with the approval of the schools forum. A list of those services for which funding can be de-delegated can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-16-schools-funding-local-authority-guidance-for-2022-to-2023">schools funding 2022 to 2023 operational guide</a></p>

<p>In order to give the local authority time to plan services, some de-delegated funds are retained by local authorities after maintained schools convert to academy status. In these cases, new academies do not receive the de-delegated funds until an agreed point later in the year. Until this point local authorities should continue to provide services to new academies where funding is de-delegated, if they are asked to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Academies opening on 1 September 2022</strong> will receive the full de-delegated amount for the academic year and should therefore secure these services independently from this point.</p>

<p><strong>For academies opening after 1 September 2022,</strong> de-delegation funding will only be provided for the period from 1 April 2023 onwards. Until this point the local authority should continue to provide the services to new academies where funding is de-delegated, if they are asked to do so. If the local authority is unable to provide the requested service then they could, alternatively, pay the funding directly to the academy.</p>

<h2>Sample Table A – school budget share</h2>

<p>This example for an academy opening on 1 November 2022 includes explanations to help you understand your own table A.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Basic entitlement age weighted pupil unit (AWPU)</h3>

<p>For 2022 to 2023, the basic entitlement for primary and secondary pupils are £2,000 and £3,000 respectively. The local authority can set different unit values for key stage 3 (<abbr title="key stage 3">KS3</abbr>) and key stage 4 (<abbr title="key stage 4">KS4</abbr>) but each of these must be at least £3,000 per pupil.</p>

<p>Local authorities also have the option to apply a reception uplift, for example to add new reception pupils starting between the autumn 2020 and January 2021 census</p>

<h2>Minimum per pupil funding level (<abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> provides a minimum per pupil funding value when setting the funding levels for local authorities. These minimum per pupil values have increased for 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The calculation of the minimum per pupil funding rate has been simplified to ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups.</p>

<p>The use of the minimum per pupil rate has also been made mandatory, though, in certain circumstances, local authorities can apply to change the rate(s) through the ‘disapplication’ process.</p>

<p>The calculation of the ‘test’ for any uplift for the minimum per pupil funding has been simplified; the option for the local authority to exclude elements of funding has been removed so that now mobility is always included in the calculation and premises (for example, rates, private finance initiative (PFI), split sites) are always excluded.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency for all schools, including those with non-standard year groups, this year we have simplified the calculation for a school’s individual minimum per pupil levels within the <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>. For all schools, we will now apply the following calculation:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>((Number of primary year groups R - Y6 × £4,265) + (Number of KS3 year groups Y7 - Y9 × £5,525) + (Number of KS4 year groups Y10 &amp; Y11 × £5,831))</p>

<p>divided by total number of year groups</p>
</div>

<p>This calculation will provide per-pupil funding of at least £4,265 for each primary school, and £5,525 for each secondary school with standard structures of 7 and 5 year groups respectively. For middle schools, all-through schools and other schools with a non-standard year group structure this will produce a specific minimum per pupil value that relates to the number of year groups in each phase.</p>

<p>The total academy allocation (less excluded factors mentioned above) is divided by the funded number on roll (NOR) (reception to year 11) to arrive at the per pupil allocation for comparing with the <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr>.</p>

<p>If the academy’s per pupil allocation is higher than the minimum per pupil rate set by the local authority, the <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> adjustment allocation is zero. Otherwise, the <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> adjustment allocation is calculated as the minimum per pupil level rate, less the calculated per pupil allocation, multiplied by NOR.</p>

<p>Where an academy receives a minimum per pupil funding level allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation. Similarly, where they do not receive a <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> allocation, capping and scaling will not take the budget lower than the minimum per pupil funding level.</p>

<p>Further details are included in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022/#table-b%20%E2%80%93%20minimum-funding-guarantee"><abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> section.</a></p>

<h2>The sparsity factor</h2>

<p>For each school, those pupils for whom the school is the closest eligible school are identified and then the average distance to the second nearest eligible school for these pupils is calculated. Distances are calculated using the road-miles distance from a pupil’s postcode to a school’s postcode. This has been calculated using pupil and school postcode coordinates from the autumn pupil level and school level census.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this factor, selective grammar and single-sex schools are not considered when identifying this second nearest school. In addition, pupils living outside of England are excluded from the sparsity distance calculations.</p>

<p>The school size criteria in the sparsity calculation is based on average year group.</p>

<p>A school may attract sparsity funding if it meets the following criteria, bearing in mind that the LA <strong>may</strong> select a distance taper which, where applied, schools with a sparsity distance less than the main threshold but over 80% will reduce these average distances:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Phase</th>
      <th scope="col">Average year group size fewer than:</th>
      <th scope="col">Average distance from second nearest school (if taper not selected)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary</td>
      <td>21.4 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Middle</td>
      <td>69.2 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secondary</td>
      <td>120 pupils</td>
      <td>3 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>All-through</td>
      <td>62.5 pupils</td>
      <td>2 miles or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Local authorities can narrow the eligibility criteria by increasing the average distance to the second nearest school or reducing the pupil number thresholds. They may not widen the eligibility criteria. Local authorities can determine a sparsity lump sum for each of the above phases, up to a maximum of £100,000 per academy in each case. They can also use a ‘taper’ so that the amount paid to an institution is relative to their pupil numbers. This means the smallest schools receive higher sparsity funding.</p>

<p>Local authorities can apply the <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr> methodology, which gives the lump sum to the smallest schools and then applies a taper for those with an average year group size greater than 50% of the threshold.</p>

<p>Where the LA chooses to use the new sparsity distance threshold, mirroring <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>, schools with a sparsity distance between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will attract some sparsity funding through the <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>. This is a change that has been introduced for 2022 to 2023. The amount depends on both their size and how far away their sparsity distance is from the main threshold. The closer the school’s sparsity distance to the main distance threshold, the greater their allocation and vice versa. Schools with a sparsity distance half-way between the distance taper threshold and the main threshold will receive half as much as they would were they equal to or above the main threshold.</p>

<p>Local authorities can also apply to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> to include an additional lump sum of up to £50,000 for very small secondary schools in sparsely populated areas. The criteria for eligibility of a school are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pupils present in years 10 and 11</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>350 pupils or fewer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a sparsity distance of 5 miles or more</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If this additional funding applies to your academy it will be shown in the exceptional circumstances part of table A.</p>

<h2>Table B – Minimum Funding Guarantee (<abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr>)</h2>

<p><abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> does not apply to free schools who will instead receive funding protection in their first year of opening.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022/#sample-table-b%E2%80%93minimum-funding-guarantee-2022-to-2023">Table B</a> sets out how your <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> is calculated In your first year of opening this is calculated by the local authority. The <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> is a protection against changes in per pupil SBS funding between the 2021 to 2022 and 2022 to 2023 academic years. The amount of protection will vary according to the impact of local changes in the funding formula and the effect of these on individual per pupil rates.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>In 2022 to 2023, local authorities have the flexibility to set local MFG between +0.5% and +2% per pupil in order to offer higher levels of protection locally.</p>
</div>

<p>To determine whether to apply the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr>, we calculate and compare the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> per pupil values for the 2 academic years. If the change in per pupil funding is less than the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> rate set by the local authority, then an <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> adjustment is applied to ensure per pupil funding increases by the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> rate.</p>

<p>Where the local authority chooses to apply capping and scaling, if there is a change in per pupil funding of more than the cap they set, then gains over this cap are scaled back according to the scaling factor the local authority chooses to apply.</p>

<p>As the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation operates at a per pupil level, not on the overall SBS, we do not protect falling budgets caused by a reduction in pupil numbers.</p>

<p><abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> is not calculated for special and alternative provision academies, as these are funded for the number of agreed high needs places.</p>

<p><abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> applies to pupils in reception to year 11, excluding any reception uplift if it is applied by the local authority.</p>

<h2>Exclusions and adjustments</h2>

<p>A number of exclusions and adjustments are applied to the respective SBS to ensure a valid comparison.</p>

<h3>Exclusions</h3>

<p>The funding lines automatically excluded from the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>early years funding – this is paid by the local authority and not included in the SBS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current year and baseline lump sum – this is not treated as a per pupil amount because for small schools the lump sum forms a significant amount per pupil. If it were included in the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation it would build in excessive protection where a school is increasing its numbers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current year and baseline sparsity factor - sparsity is handled in the same way as the lump sum though it is not in itself per pupil funding so including it would distort the protection that <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> provides,</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any additional lump sum funding received in the 2021 to 2022 academic year by academies that amalgamated during the 2020 to 2021 academic year, is deducted from the baseline only. Any additional lump sum funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year for academies previously amalgamated is excluded from the 2022 to 2023 <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> budget, but not the baseline.</p>

<p>If local authorities wish to exclude any additional funding lines from the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation (from either the 2021 to 2022 baseline funding or the 2022 to 2023 academic year funding) they must make an exceptional case to <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, however local authorities can exclude other premises factors from the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> without a disapplication, if they wish to mirror the <abbr title="national funding formula">NFF</abbr>.</p>

<p>An example of an approved <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> exclusion is where a school would be receiving split site funding for the first time in the 2022 to 2023 academic year. This exclusion allows the school to receive the full benefit of the additional funding.</p>

<p>Similarly, where a school will no longer be operating on a split site in 2022 to 2023, the local authority may wish to exclude the split site funding from the baseline for 2021 to 2022 when calculating the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr>, so that the protection does not include funding for which the school is no longer eligible.</p>

<h3>Technical adjustments</h3>

<p>Local authorities can make technical adjustments to the 2021 to 2022 baseline to make this comparable with 2022 to 2023 funding in certain exceptional circumstances (these adjustments can also be made to 2022 to 2023, to match 2021 to 2022). These relate to changes in delegation, for example, where a budget was previously funded centrally and is now delegated into the funding formula, or where funding has been moved to the high needs block to commission <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> places for schools as well as for the local authority.</p>

<h2>Capping and scaling – affordability adjustments</h2>

<p>Local authorities are able to cap and/or scale back overall gains for schools to make the funding formula affordable. The cap is the limit to which any per pupil gains in SBS can be retained by the school or academy. The scale is the degree to which gains above the cap will be scaled back in the calculation. Local authorities in consultation with their schools forums determine whether and how to limit gains. This must be applied on the same basis to all schools.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a 4% cap and 40% scaling means gains up to 4% are kept by schools, and any gains above 4% are scaled back by 40%</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a 10% cap and 100% scaling means all gains above 10% are removed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a 0% cap and 70% scaling means all gains are scaled back by 70%</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your SBS includes all gains before any <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> is applied. Any adjustments made as a result of capping or scaling will appear as a negative amount on your summary table.</p>

<p>Capping and scaling will not be applied to new schools if they have opened in the last 7 years and do not have all year groups present. The local authority may also opt not to use this if they wish.</p>

<h3>Capping and scaling and <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr>
</h3>

<p>Where an academy receives a <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> allocation, they will be exempt from capping and scaling in the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> module.</p>

<p>Similarly, where an academy does not receive an <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr> allocation, capping and scaling should not take the budget lower than the <abbr title="minimum per pupil funding level">MPPFL</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Table B: Funding protection</h2>

<p>Funding protection only applies to free schools and only applies in place of the <abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr> calculation used for academies in their first year of opening.</p>

<p>Funding protection limits the impact of differences in the per-pupil funding element of budgets developed using the previous year’s financial template and/or ready reckoner and actual budgets based on the new local formula. The protection will limit the difference in per pupil funding to +0.5% and +2.0% per pupil in order to offer higher levels of protection locally.</p>

<p>This element of protection funding is only applicable for the first year of opening.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether the protection needs to be applied, we compare the 2021 to 2022 academic year local authority average per pupil rate (intended to be representative of the funding in that year’s free schools ‘ready reckoner’) to the 2022 to 2023 academic year local authority average per pupil rate.</p>

<p>If there is a fall in per pupil funding between the two academic years of more than the rate set by the local authority, then a protection amount will be payable.</p>

<p>The per pupil protection amount will be calculated using the 2022 to 2023 academic year pupil numbers to find the total protection amount to be added to the individual academy SBS. Table B shows the funding protection calculation. This will be shown on the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> statement as a ‘funding protection’ amount.</p>

<h2>Table C – academic year 2022 to 2023 post-opening grant (start-up grant)</h2>

<h2>Start-up grant (SUG)</h2>

<p>SUG is paid to fully sponsored academies only so these lines will not be populated in your statement if you are a free school or a converter.</p>

<p>There are 2 elements, part A and part B. Part A is a flat rate allocation that is paid in the first year of opening. Part B is a formulaic allocation that is intended to contribute to costs, such as leadership, as a new academy grows towards full capacity. It is paid over 2 years for primary schools and 3 years for secondary schools. All pupil or place counts will be agreed at point of opening and will not change for the purposes of calculating SUG thereafter.</p>

<p>The part A rates and the calculation of part B are different for primary and secondary, and for special and alternative provision academies. More information is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-academies-funding-guidance-for-sponsors">sponsored academies funding: advice for sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2>Post-opening grant (POG)</h2>

<p>The POG only applies to free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges (UTCs).</p>

<p>Free schools established through the local authority presumption route will not attract POG, the local authority is responsible for the pre-opening development costs and post-opening funding required to address diseconomies of scale until the school reaches full capacity.</p>

<p>Free schools, studio schools and UTCs are provided with a POG to reflect the additional costs in establishing a new publicly-funded school which cannot be met through the <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr>. The POG provides funding in 2 elements as the free school grows: per pupil resources, paid on a per pupil basis, and a leadership diseconomies grant. These titles reflect the basis on which the funding is calculated, but the grant can be spent on any legitimate purpose of the school.</p>

<p>The first element (resources) is paid each year that the school builds up to capacity for each new pupil expected to be on roll. The resources element is calculated at the time that the financial plan is agreed, prior to opening; the POG <strong>will not</strong> be reviewed on an annual basis to reflect actual pupil numbers meaning once awarded, the POG will be paid in line with the original financial plan.</p>

<p>The second element (leadership) is paid annually based on the number of year groups that the school will ultimately have that do not yet have pupils. The amount is paid to mainstream schools with pupils aged 5 to 15 each year depending on how many year groups (cohorts) are empty.</p>

<h2>Table D – pre-16 high needs place funding</h2>

<p>For mainstream academies and free schools, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> determines the rate of place funding amount based on occupancy data provided in the authority proforma tool (<abbr title="authority proforma tool">APT</abbr>), with the number of places confirmed as part of the place change notification process. The <abbr title="authority proforma tool">APT</abbr> is the tool local authorities use to submit their local funding formulae each year and we ask them to reflect high needs unit occupancy as at the October census for the appropriate year and use that to calculate the occupied and unoccupied places to be funded. Occupied places will be funded at £6,000. Pupils in these places will also attract funding through the mainstream school formula.</p>

<p>Other places are funded at £10,000. This may apply where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the place is or will be occupied by a pupil registered on the roll of another school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a place isn’t occupied at the time of the school census count, but is likely to be filled, and requires funding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>spare capacity is required for another reason</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> confirms the number of high needs places in mainstream academies and free schools to fund in 2022 to 2023 as part of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">annual place change notification</a> process.</p>

<p>This provides a base level of funding. Any additional funding above this level (top-up) must be agreed with your commissioning local authority. Top-up funding is paid by the local authority and is therefore not shown on your <abbr title="general annual grant">GAG</abbr> funding statement. Further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs funding arrangements for 2022 to 2023</a> is available.</p>

<p>For any schools converting to an academy who are outside the scope of the annual place change notification process, place numbers will be determined using high needs and alternative provision (September to March) data.</p>

<p>EFSA must be notified if the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://content.explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/api/releases/D8574425-943C-41E5-B0C0-F45A1DC12792/files/234A21B6-722E-4800-8762-08D9924737DF" rel="external">section 251</a> data does not match the place numbers agreed with the local authority.</p>

<p>To inform <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> of changes, notify the project lead overseeing the conversion to academy. <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> must be notified of any change before conversion to an academy takes place. If <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr> is not notified of changes prior to conversion, section 251 will be used.</p>

The sources of pupil numbers are the autumn 2021 census or the estimates provided by academies and agreed high needs places. Within your allocation the number of pupils attracting the various funding elements may differ. For example, the calculation for minimum funding guarantee (<abbr title="minimum funding guarantee">MFG</abbr>) does not include reception uplift pupils <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For census-funded academies, pupil numbers are taken from the autumn 2021 validated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/school-census">school census</a> using single registration at the school and current main-dual registration. However, where the local authority notifies us of variations in school census numbers (through their authority proforma tool, for planned growth or infrastructure changes) then these will be used to calculate your allocation.</p>

<p>For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-funded-on-estimates">academies funded on estimates</a> pupil numbers are drawn from the final validated revenue funding data collection (RFDC) dataset.</p>

<p>For free schools In your first year of opening, your pupil numbers will be taken from your finance plan.</p>
