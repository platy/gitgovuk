<h2>Why the Government has introduced <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>This supply route has been designed to ensure that people in Northern Ireland (NI) can continue to access prescription-only medicines (POMs) should clinical need be unable to be met through authorised products or any other existing regulatory routes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> provides a route for the lawful supply of POMs in compliance with UK and EU rules, where there is a risk that clinical need in NI for that product cannot be met. This includes supply of medicines that are unlicensed in NI, but which are licensed and approved in GB. Supplying medicines via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> is essential on public health grounds and having this additional route for supply means POMs can be supplied to NI, to meet clinical need, in accordance with their GB marketing authorisation.</p>

<p>This route will be tightly governed by the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, with all medicines supplied via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> already complying with the strong regulatory safeguards required for a product to enter the Great Britain (GB) market. All medicines supplied this way into NI will meet the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s (<abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) robust standards for safety, quality and efficacy which are in place for the rest of the UK.</p>

<h2>Medicines eligible for supply via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>
</h2>

<p>In order to supply a medicine from GB to NI via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>, the following criteria must be met:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The product is classified as a Prescription Only Medicine (<abbr title="prescription-only medicines">POM</abbr>). Pharmacy medicines and General Sales List medicines are not eligible for supply to NI via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>.</li>
  <li>The medicine has a valid GB licence thereby meeting the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s stringent requirements for safety, quality and efficacy. Medicines which are unlicensed in GB will not be eligible.</li>
  <li>The medicine appears on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-eligible-for-northern-ireland-mhra-authorised-route"><abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list</a>. This list sets out the medicines that can be supplied under the provisions of <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>, as decided by the Department for Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) in partnership with the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and the Department of Health (<abbr title="Department of Health">DoH</abbr>) Northern Ireland.</li>
</ol>

<h3>List eligibility</h3>

<p>Inclusion on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list is determined by assessing NI patient need and system-wide impact. A decision is taken on whether there may be a clinical unmet need for the medicine in NI. This process is managed by <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> in partnership with <abbr title="Department of Health">DoH</abbr>.</p>

<p>There is no application process for a medicine to be placed on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list. MAHs should use existing processes to notify <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> of their intention to discontinue a product in Northern Ireland or if there is an anticipated shortage of a product specific to the Northern Ireland market. <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Health">DoH</abbr> will then assess unmet clinical need for the product, identify any suitable alternatives, and make a decision about its inclusion on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list.</p>

<p>The list will be regularly reviewed and updated to accurately represent the medicines available for supply to in the NI market via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Distinguishing between supply under <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> and Regulation 167 (specials route)</h2>

<p>Specials are unlicensed medicines which have been specifically manufactured or imported for treatment on an individual patient basis, where there is an unmet clinical need. This route remains unchanged and this supply route remains an option for eligible products.</p>

<p>Medicines on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list are licensed by the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, as the UK’s medicines regulator, for use in Great Britain. The <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> also approves this route for their supply in Northern Ireland, where a suitable alternative is not available to meet clinical need. The <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> medicines are therefore identical to medicines already used in NI.</p>

<h2>Distribution of <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> medicines to NI</h2>

<p>There are two methods by which <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> listed products may be supplied to end users in Northern Ireland:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Directly from marketing authorisation holders and wholesale dealers based in Great Britain</li>
  <li>Via wholesale dealers based in Northern Ireland</li>
</ol>

<p>A holder of a wholesale dealer’s or manufacturers licence can lawfully supply <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> listed products to pharmacies, hospitals, and wholesalers in NI. New regulation <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1452/regulation/11/made" rel="external">43ZA</a>, sets out the obligations that are placed on holders of wholesale dealer’s licences in GB supplying <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> listed products to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Medicines which are <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> listed products can be supplied to NI on the same terms as medicines with a marketing authorisation valid in Northern Ireland (PL and PLNI). There will be no changes to licensing requirements for wholesale dealers supplying <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> products.</p>

<p>Wholesalers should refer to the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list to determine if a product can be supplied to NI using the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> route. If it is on the list, then it can be supplied. If a product is removed from the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list, remaining stock that is already in the NI market can be distributed. However, once a product is removed from the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list it is not possible to supply new stock from GB to NI, under <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>. Reasonable notice will be provided prior to the removal of a product from the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list.</p>

<p>Where a brand is not stipulated for a product published on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list, it means that any equivalent generic or brand of that molecule of that specific strength can be supplied to NI in any pack size. Wholesalers should not supply any strength other than the one specified. Products must be a <abbr title="prescription-only medicines">POM</abbr> presentation as only <abbr title="prescription-only medicines">POM</abbr> products are eligible for supply via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>.</p>

<p>For some products on the list, brand names have also been included alongside the generic molecule for clinical reasons. For these products, only the brand specified should be supplied to NI via <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>.</p>

<p>GB wholesalers sending products to NI should ensure that medicines that are not authorised for NI are on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list. Medicines with a marketing authorisation valid only in GB labelled as PLGB may not have a Unique Identifier to enable verification or decommissioning as required by EU Delegated Regulation 2016/161.  There is currently no reporting requirement for medicines supplied to NI under <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr>. This remains under review and should the requirement change, new guidance will be provided.</p>

<h2>Prescribing medicines on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list</h2>

<p>Prescribers in Northern Ireland do not need to do anything different to prescribe or access medicines through this route. As such, medicines on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list can continue to be prescribed to patients as normal. All products on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list will be authorised by the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in GB and remain equally as safe and effective for patients in NI. They will all be products which <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Health">DoH</abbr> consider are required to meet clinical need in NI. They are approved by the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for supply on this basis and are a separate category from medicines authorised through Regulation 167 of the Human Medicines Regulations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> is designed to ensure that NI patients have access to the same prescription only medicines and innovative products as patients in GB, ensuring that healthcare provision across the UK is equitable. All medicinal products supplied via this route will meet the <abbr title="Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s stringent requirements for safety, quality and efficacy.</p>

<h2>Dispensing medicines on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list</h2>

<p>There is no requirement for end users to identify <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> products and they can be supplied to patients on the same terms as medicines with a marketing authorisation valid in Northern Ireland (PL and PLNI).  Medicines on the <abbr title="Northern Ireland MHRA Authorised Route">NIMAR</abbr> list do not need to be serialised for FMD, there is no requirement to decommission these products as required by EU Delegated Regulation 2016/161.</p>

<p>Patients in NI do not need to do anything different to access medicines through this route. Registered health professionals who supply medicines to a pre-defined group of patients under Patient Group Directions (<abbr title="Patient Group Directions">PGDs</abbr>) do not need to do anything differently.</p>
