<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Consultation on proposed deer management strategy</h2>

<p>Defra are seeking views on key proposals for a deer management strategy developed by the Forestry Commission and Defra.</p>

<p>We need to do more to manage deer populations to protect new and existing woodland, support successful tree establishment rates, reduce damage to agricultural crops, and improve biodiversity. As set out within the England Trees Action Plan, we recognise that a growing deer population is putting more browsing pressure on woodland ground flora, damaging trees, and inhibiting regeneration of new and existing woodlands.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The development of the deer management strategy proposals have been guided by broad consensus across stakeholder audiences from the England Tree Strategy Consultation in 2020.&nbsp; All agreed that long-term sustainable solutions are required to ensure that an action plan for trees, woodland and forestry is successful in its aims.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This consultation on the proposed deer management strategy will gather views on key proposals being considered. These include reviewing the evidence base, current barriers to effective management, relevant legislation, regulation and incentives, as well as developing sector capacity, skills and markets. These views will help shape the final actions that are included in the deer management strategy.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The four-week Defra consultation on the deer management strategy is now open. Defra and the Forestry Commission welcome your views. The consultation closes at 23:45 on 2 September 2022 and we will issue a response in due course. Please visit the GOV.UK consultation page: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/deer-management-strategy">Deer management strategy page</a> to respond.<br>

<span class="number">2. </span>New findings of Oak Processionary Moth in Hampshire</h2>

<p>New findings of the tree pest Oak Processionary Moth (OPM) have been identified in a small area of Hampshire, following the Forestry Commission’s enhanced plant health surveillance activity.</p>

<p>We&nbsp;are urging landowners, the public, and trade&nbsp;to remain vigilant for the pest and report any sightings.&nbsp;The findings&nbsp;are located in a small area in Hampshire within the Pest-Free Area. Rapid and robust action is being taken to investigate and address these findings, including targeted surveys and control measures to reduce pest prevalence and minimise its spread. We will continue to monitor for OPM throughout the Pest-Free Area through an extensive surveillance and trapping programme.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Biodiversity Digital Services Project: expressions of interest</h2>

<p>The Natural England &amp; Defra Digital Team are seeking volunteers to participate in their current user research and prototype testing of the Biodiversity Net Gain Register.</p>

<p>Biodiversity net gain is an approach to development which means that habitats for wildlife must be left in a measurably better state than they were in before the development.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Introduced in the Environment Act 2021, BNG will become mandatory for all developments under the Town and Country Planning Act from November 2023 and for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) by November 2025.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Natural England and Defra want to work with those who are likely to be involved in BNG to help develop and refine the systems, tools and processes that will support mandatory BNG.<br>
