<p>Base vehicles used for grant eligible wheelchair accessible vehicles (<abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicles">WAVs</abbr>) must have a recommended retail price (<abbr title="recommended retail price">RRP</abbr>) below £35,000 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#price">full price definition</a>), subject to grant limits. This excludes the cost of conversion.</p>

<p>A base vehicle is a standard vehicle that can be modified by a converter to create a <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr>.</p>

<p>We regularly review grant levels. Both the level of grant and the criteria for each category is liable to change at the discretion of the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>).</p>

<h2>How the scheme operates</h2>

<p>The plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant (<abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr>) can only be claimed by new <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicles">WAVs</abbr> at first registration. Preregistration conversions are eligible to apply for the grant scheme. Post-registration conversions are not eligible for the grant.</p>

<h2>Eligible vehicles</h2>

<p>To be eligible for the grant, the base vehicle needs to meet certain criteria to provide a minimum level of assurance to consumers.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to alter these criteria. For example, if during the <abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr> new regulations or standards come into force, these eligibility criteria will be bought in line with those regulations or standards.</p>

<p>To claim the <abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr>, a base vehicle must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>priced at £35,000 or less</li>
  <li>suitable for conversion to a <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr>, such as a large multipurpose vehicle (MPV)</li>
</ul>

<p>A list of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants">eligible base vehicles for conversion</a> is regularly updated.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of a base vehicle suitable for conversion to a <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> should apply so it can be listed as eligible.</p>

<p>Once a base vehicle has been considered eligible, details of the relationship between government and the applicant will be provided in an agreement. The vehicle will be formally approved for the scheme when the agreement is returned signed.</p>

<p>Convertors may not apply directly for a vehicle to be listed as eligible. They should work with manufacturers to ensure suitable vehicles are approved and added to the eligible vehicles list.</p>

<h2>Applications for vehicles with multiple variants</h2>

<p>When applying for more than one variant of the same vehicle to become eligible for the scheme, a single reference number and agreement will be  used as long as the variants are covered by the same type approval and warranty terms.</p>

<p>New variants of a vehicle that is already eligible for the grant are not automatically eligible. A variant of a vehicle that requires an extension to type approval documentation will need to be approved separately.</p>

<p>Manufacturers should apply for these new variants to be approved under the grant scheme.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether a new variant of a vehicle needs to be approved, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInGrants@dft.gov.uk">PlugInGrants@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Definition of price for application of the grant cap</h2>

<p>To be eligible for the <abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr>, eligible base vehicles must be priced below £35,000  subject to grant limits.</p>

<p>The definition of <abbr title="recommended retail price">RRP</abbr> includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VAT, including VAT reclaimable by a business</li>
  <li>vehicle manufacturer or dealer’s mandatory extras including delivery charges or administration fees</li>
  <li>the battery cost (including where the battery is leased)</li>
  <li>any non-standard option fitted by the manufacturer or dealer affecting the capacity of the battery, drive train configuration or maximum net power</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of <abbr title="recommended retail price">RRP</abbr> excludes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>modifications for disabled users, including <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> conversions</li>
  <li>any non-standard option fitted by the manufacturer or dealer that does not affect the capacity of the battery, drive train configuration or maximum net power</li>
  <li>modifications such as ‘police packs’, ambulance/fire engine modifications</li>
  <li>warranty/insurance and service packages</li>
  <li>first registration fee and cost of first licence</li>
  <li>discounts (including rebates)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a vehicle model has a price range that straddles the cap, only those variants/trim levels priced below the cap will be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>Variants or trim levels of eligible vehicles that are priced above the price cap are not eligible for the grant.</p>

<h2>Applying for the grant</h2>

<p>From the customer’s point of view, the <abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr> is deducted from the price of the vehicle at the point of sale by the dealership.</p>

<p>Both private consumers and businesses can benefit from the <abbr title="plug-in wheelchair accessible vehicle grant">PiWG</abbr> when purchasing a qualifying zero emission vehicle and registering it to a UK address<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> convertors will need to work with the manufacturer to register claims for vehicles they have committed to sell.</p>

<p>Claims will be paid to the manufacturer on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Once a vehicle has been formally approved for the scheme, the manufacturer and its selected dealerships will be given access to an online portal, through which they can register claims for eligible vehicles.</p>

<p>Further details of this process will be made available to the applicant once a vehicle has been formally approved for the scheme. Alternatively, details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-vehicle-grant-portal-guidance">Plug-in grant portal guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is an annual cap on the maximum number of grants for <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicles">WAVs</abbr>. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility">Low-emission vehicles eligible for a plug-in grant</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Application process</h2>

<p>Those wishing to apply for a base vehicle  to become eligible for the scheme should complete:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-wheelchair-accessible-vehicle-grants-eligibility-and-applications">Form A: PIWG scheme number application</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-wheelchair-accessible-vehicle-grants-eligibility-and-applications">Form B: plug-in <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> grant application cover sheet</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Attach the required supporting evidence in English.</p>

<p>Form A should be completed and emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) will then supply access to the large file transfer system required to submit Form B and the relevant supporting evidence.</p>

<p>Detailed guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-wheelchair-accessible-vehicle-grants-eligibility-and-applications">how to complete the application form</a> is provided.</p>

<p>Any questions regarding the application process should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Assessment process</h2>

<p>Applications will be processed as soon as they are received and we would hope to make a decision within 2 months from the time all documents are received.</p>

<p>This depends on the complexity of the application and whether further technical information is required.</p>

<p>We recommend that applicants engage as early as possible with <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> and <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> to allow time for the application to be processed.</p>

<p>The assessment process is as follows:</p>

<p>1. Applicant submits completed Form A: plug-in <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> grant scheme number application to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk">PlugInApprovals@vca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> provides a scheme number and access to the file transfer system.</p>

<p>3. Manufacturer submits Form B: Plug-in <abbr title="wheelchair accessible vehicle">WAV</abbr> grant application cover sheet and the required supporting evidence onto the file transfer system.</p>

<p>4. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> confirms the application has been received and is complete or requests further information.</p>

<p>5. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> confirms the validity of type approval certificates and warranty documentation presented as evidence.</p>

<p>6. <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decides the application has passed</li>
  <li>decides the application has failed</li>
  <li>requests further information from the applicant</li>
  <li>requests advice from independent technical experts before coming to a decision, at a potential cost to the applicant (<a class="govuk-link" href="#costs">see Costs</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>7. If the vehicle passes the assessment process, an offer letter will be sent to the applicant setting out the terms of acceptance.</p>

<p>8. If the vehicle fails, a letter will be sent to the applicant explaining the reasons why and recommending steps the vehicle manufacturer might wish to take before resubmitting an application.</p>

<p>9. If the vehicle passes, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will upload its make, model and trim if applicable onto the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility">eligible vehicles list</a>.</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>

<p>Cases where independent technical expertise is needed to assess applications are likely to be rare. In such cases, however, there may be a cost to the applicant.</p>

<p>Independent technical advice is most likely to be required for <a class="govuk-link" href="url">battery or fuel cell degradation</a>.</p>

<h2>Review of decision</h2>

<p>Applicants have a right to seek a review of the <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> decision. Further details will be provided to the applicant in the letter advising that the application had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>If significant further work is required to validate the submitted evidence, the applicant may be asked to meet those costs. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will let the applicant know if this applies, to enable the applicant to decide whether they wish to meet the costs or to withdraw the application.</p>

<p>Applicants are encouraged to contact <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> with any specific questions.</p>
