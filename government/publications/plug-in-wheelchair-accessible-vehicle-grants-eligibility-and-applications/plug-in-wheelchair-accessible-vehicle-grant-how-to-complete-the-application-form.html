<ul>
  <li>a copy of the communication form issued by the authority approving the vehicle to UNECE Regulation 101 and document pack</li>
  <li>the type approval certificate (including addendum) issued by the authority approving the vehicle to Regulation (EC) No 715/2007</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3&nbsp;Zero </span> emission range</h3>

<p>The vehicle must have a zero-emission range of at least 70 miles.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To verify the vehicle’s zero emission range, you must provide one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the communication form issued by the authority approving the vehicle to UNECE Regulation 101 and document pack</li>
  <li>the type approval certificate (including addendum) issued by the authority approving the vehicle to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2007/715/contents" rel="external">Regulation (EC) No 715/2007</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4&nbsp;Maximum </span> speed</h3>

<p>To allow safe use on trunk roads and motorways, vehicles must be able to travel at a speed of at least 60mph (96 <abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>).</p>

<p>Different manufacturers use different processes for assessing maximum speed. This, alongside other environmental factors introduces considerable variation in real world performance.</p>

<p>In the event of credible concerns appearing about the vehicle achieving a maximum speed of 60mph (96 <abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>) in service, the applicant will need to pay for the vehicle to be assessed in accordance with the technical requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://unece.org/transport/vehicle-regulations-wp29/standards/addenda-1958-agreement-regulations-61-80" rel="external">UNECE Regulation 68</a>.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Transport reserves the right to impose this requirement on all applications throughout the lifetime of the scheme.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>whole vehicle type approval documents</li>
</ul>

<p>And one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the publicly available specification of the vehicle stating that the vehicle has a top speed of 60mph (96 <abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>) or greater</li>
  <li>a signed statement of vehicle maximum speed 60mph (96 <abbr title="kilometres per hour">km/h</abbr>) or greater), stating that this value will be made publicly available</li>
  <li>a copy of an approval certificate and document pack for UNECE Regulation 68</li>
  <li>a test report from an appropriately equipped and qualified technical centre that shows the vehicle has been tested in accordance with the technical requirements of UNECE Regulation 68</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5&nbsp;Warranty </span> for the vehicle and battery or fuel cell and electric drive train</h3>

<p>See the minimum warranty requirements that must be provided to meet the warranty criterion.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the warranty document showing that the requirements have been met</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Battery or fuel cell degradation</h3>

<p>For definitions and requirements of degradation see Preparing battery degradation evidence.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>These requirements can be met either through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>warranty terms that explicitly cover the battery against unreasonable degradation</li>
  <li>actual data from tests undertaken on an appropriate sample of batteries that have been in service for a period of 3 or more years, showing that they have not degraded unreasonably</li>
  <li>written assurance from the applicant that the battery will offer a reasonable performance, comparable with or better than the rates of degradation specified in Preparing battery degradation evidence. The applicant must provide evidence to support their assurance</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information on what each piece of accepted evidence requires is given in Preparing battery degradation evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7&nbsp;Crash </span> safety</h3>

<p>Base vehicles must demonstrate that they meet the minimum safety requirements of their type approval.</p>

<p>There are 2 routes to demonstrate compliance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>homologation to category M1 through EC whole vehicle type approval, UK(<abbr title="Northern Ireland">NI</abbr>) whole vehicle type approval or GB whole vehicle type approval</li>
  <li>evidence that the vehicle satisfies the crash safety standards of&nbsp;the accepted whole vehicle type approval routes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>You must provide one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the EC whole vehicle type approval certificate and document pack for the model of the car that is being presented to the <abbr title="Vehicles Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>relevant crash test certificate for the model of base vehicle that is being presented for approval to&nbsp;<abbr title="Vehicles Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, if the base vehicle has an individual vehicle approval, the relevant crash test reports must be submitted in the document pack.</p>

<p>In making the decision on what are comparable safety outcomes, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) reserves the right to require the applicant to complete crash testing if it is considered that the data provided is insufficient, or the results inconclusive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8&nbsp;Electrical </span> safety</h3>

<p>Applicants should provide a copy of the approval certificate and full document pack to&nbsp;UNECE&nbsp;Regulation 100.02.</p>

<h4>Further electrical safety</h4>

<p>The applicant must also provide evidence of action taken to mitigate electrical safety risks not covered by Regulation 100.</p>

<p>In particular, this must include a statement of what actions they will take to inform consumers about the safest way to charge and use their vehicle.</p>

<p>Issues to cover must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the voltage and amperage requirement to safely charge the <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>
</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>how the actions of the applicant will ensure compliance with the Low Voltage Directive 2 006/95/EC.</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicant could also demonstrate their commitment to consumer safety by submitting written confirmation that they will provide documentation with the vehicle that explains the safe operation and charging of the vehicle.</p>

<h4>Best practice for providing evidence</h4>

<p>Examples of best practice for providing evidence include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a one-page leaflet for new customers outlining electrical safety issues</li>
  <li>a comprehensive instruction manual with detailed instructions for owners on how to safely recharge and maintain their vehicle and risks to avoid</li>
  <li>requirement or recommendation that the consumer has a survey performed on his or her home wiring</li>
