<h2>Definition of an outbreak</h2>

<p>Care homes should follow a regular staff testing regime of weekly PCR testing and twice weekly lateral flow testing.</p>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more clinically suspected or confirmed positives (rapid lateral flow or PCR) among residents or staff detected in the same 14-day period.</p>

<p>However, one positive test result may be the first sign of an outbreak, so you should contact your local health protection team (HPT) for advice in this instance.</p>

<h2>In the event of a single case</h2>

<p>If there is only one positive case in your home (from either rapid lateral flow or PCR testing of staff or residents) contact your local HPT for advice and start rapid response daily staff testing with rapid lateral flow tests immediately.</p>

<p>Daily rapid lateral flow testing of all staff for 7 days should ideally take place as close to the beginning of their shift as possible. Based on their risk assessment, your HPT may conclude that outbreak restrictions are not required in response to a single case of COVID-19 in a staff member or resident.</p>

<p>If there is a delay in the HPT returning your call, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>start 7-day rapid response daily staff testing</li>
  <li>ensure cases are isolated and contacts identified</li>
  <li>follow <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">current guidance on the management of staff and exposed patients and residents</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it is unclear whether this is an outbreak, the HPT should err on the side of caution and recommend outbreak testing.</p>

<h2>Rapid response daily staff testing</h2>

<p>If your local HPT decides outbreak testing is not required but does advise testing, you should complete 7 days of daily staff testing using rapid lateral flow test (LFT) kits.</p>

<p>Any positive LFT result should be followed by a confirmatory PCR test.</p>

<p>If no further positive results are found within 7 days, you should stop the rapid response testing and return to the regular staff testing regime of weekly PCR testing and twice weekly lateral flow testing.</p>

<p>All confirmatory PCR tests (after an initial positive rapid LFT) must be negative too.</p>

<p>If further positive results are found, outbreak testing is required.</p>

<p>Rapid response daily Rapid lateral flow testing for staff following positive results has already helped care homes to get on top of outbreaks since it was introduced in December.</p>

<h2>Outbreak testing</h2>

<p>In an outbreak, staff and residents will follow this testing schedule.</p>

<h3>Residents</h3>

<ul>
  <li>on day 1 of the outbreak: one PCR test and one rapid LFT</li>
  <li>on day 4, 5, 6 or 7 of the outbreak: one PCR test and one rapid LFT</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff</h3>

<p>All staff will take 2 PCR tests on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 1 of the outbreak</li>
  <li>day 4, 5, 6 or 7 of the outbreak</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus daily rapid LFTs.</p>

<p>You should start (or continue, depending on your circumstances) daily rapid lateral flow testing of all staff. Keep testing staff daily until you go for 5 consecutive days without a positive result.</p>

<p>Any positive LFT result from staff or residents should be followed by a confirmatory PCR test.</p>

<p>For PCR testing follow the usual care home testing process as laid out by the National Testing Programme. If a courier is not already booked, order a same day courier for your PCR tests.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>PCR test any newly symptomatic people. Continue to isolate and ensure contact tracing is completed.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If a second or more cases are identified in staff through LFT as a result of the rapid response daily testing, and the first and second rounds of PCR testing do not detect any further cases in residents or staff, the HPT may conclude following a risk assessment that outbreak control restrictions may be lifted.</p>

<p>However, if further cases are detected via whole home PCR testing then an outbreak should be declared, and the control measures should remain in place (along with notification of the outbreak to HPT).</p>

<p>Once you have completed the above, return to the regular testing regime of testing staff twice a week (once with PCR and rapid lateral flow, and once rapid lateral flow only) and residents every 28 days with PCR.</p>

<p>Rapid response daily staff testing may continue in this scenario until no new cases have been identified for 5 days.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ending outbreak restrictions</h2>

<p>All staff and residents should be tested with PCR 14 days after the last resident or staff had a positive test result or showed coronavirus-like symptoms.</p>

<p>The local HPT will contact the care home if, following genomic sequencing of test results, they have identified a VOC (other than the Alpha (‘Kent’ variant) and the Delta variant (the variant first identified in India)), at which point they will discuss whether additional measures need to be put in place to enable additional protection. This might include an extension to the period of an outbreak up to 28 days from the last positive test.</p>

<p>If there are no positive PCR results from this ‘end of outbreak testing’, the HPT will declare the outbreak over.</p>

<p>The regular resident testing cycle of 28 days can be delayed to coincide with this ‘end of outbreak testing’ if the 2 test dates fall within a week of each other.</p>

<p>Any further positive cases after this point is a new suspected or confirmed outbreak. The care home must contact the HPT and immediately begin <a class="govuk-link" href="#rapid-response-testing">rapid response testing</a> again.</p>

<p>If no further cases are identified at this point, the outbreak is considered to have ended. Resume the normal testing regime.</p>

<h2>The 90-day window after a positive test</h2>

<p>If someone has tested positive with a PCR test, they should not be tested using either PCR or rapid lateral flow tests for 90 days, unless they develop new symptoms during this time – in which case they should be retested immediately using PCR.</p>

<p>This 90-day period is from the initial onset of symptoms or, if asymptomatic when tested, their positive test result.</p>

<h2>Newly symptomatic people</h2>

<p>You should PCR test all newly symptomatic people, staff and resident. Also, continue to isolate and ensure contract tracing has been completed.</p>

<h2>If you need more test kits</h2>

<p>Contact 119 and ask for an urgent delivery if you are running out of the kits to do the necessary testing.</p>

<p>You should receive kits within 48 hours.</p>
