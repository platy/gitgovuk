<h4>Changes in this publication</h4>

<p>This guidance was updated on 15 December 2021, in order to reflect changes to the regular testing policy for staff and residents in adult care homes in England. It also includes advice for returning tests by post as well as by courier. This version replaces the previous Care home COVID-19 guidance available in PDF format.</p>

<p>Further guidance is made available elsewhere for:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is for care home managers and providers to set out the current policy for regular asymptomatic and outbreak testing in care homes. Based on the current prevalence and clinical advice, the aim of this policy is to enable positive cases to be identified quickly, enabling action to stop the spread. We will keep this policy under review as the situation changes.</p>

<p>Providing testing within all adult care homes will help you protect your residents and staff and is an important part of the national effort to tackle COVID-19. This testing policy applies to everyone regardless of vaccination status. Thank you for everything you are doing to help the country beat the virus at this hugely challenging time.</p>

<h2>Testing policy for staff and residents</h2>

<h3>Regular testing for staff</h3>

<p>You should test all asymptomatic staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>weekly, using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits, on the same day each week</li>
  <li>3 times a week using rapid lateral flow tests (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) – one on the same day as the weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, and additional rapid lateral flow test every 2 to 3 days</li>
  <li>immediately before their shift, with a rapid lateral flow test, where they are working in multiple locations, and have worked somewhere else since their last shift in the home.</li>
  <li>before the start of their shift on the first day back to work, after a period of leave resulting in them missing their weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, with a rapid lateral flow test (that is, after annual leave or sick leave on entry back into the care home</li>
</ul>

<h3>Regular testing for residents</h3>

<p>You should test all residents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monthly, using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits</li>
  <li>as soon as they join your care home, if they are new, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>immediately if they develop symptoms, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Do not wait for the next test in the regular testing pattern.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rapid response daily rapid lateral flow testing for staff</h3>

<p>Where there is one or more positive result from rapid lateral flow test or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, from either a resident or staff member, staff should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conduct daily rapid lateral flow test for at least 7 days, and until no new positives have been found for 5 consecutive days, as close to the beginning of their shift as possible – this is in addition to the regular asymptomatic <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they receive a positive rapid lateral flow test result – the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is in addition to the weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test that all staff undertake, unless they tested positive on the same day that they did their weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>contact your local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) for advice</li>
</ul>

<p>You only need to test staff working in the home over the rapid response testing period. You do not need to test those who are not working. There is no requirement to bring people into work to get tested on their non-working days.</p>

<p>If any further positives are found through rapid response daily testing, see the section below on [outbreak testing] (#outbreak-testing).</p>

<h3>Outbreak testing</h3>

<h4>Definition of a care home outbreak</h4>

<p>An outbreak consists of 2, or more, positive or clinically suspected cases of COVID-19 during a 14-day period. This applies to both staff and residents and includes <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow test results. If you have one or more positive cases (or multiple symptomatic individuals), please contact your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> for advice. One positive test result may be the first sign of an outbreak, so you should also contact your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> for advice in this instance.</p>

<p>The testing process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for all staff and residents, once on day 1 of the outbreak and once between days 4 and 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>start (or continue, depending on your circumstances) daily rapid lateral flow testing of all staff, until there has not been a positive result for 5 consecutive days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when you carry out the outbreak <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for residents (day 1 and once again between days 4 to 7), also test the resident with a rapid lateral flow test on the same day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing follow the usual care home testing process, as outlined above. If a courier is not already booked, order a same-day courier for your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test any newly symptomatic residents with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to isolate and ensure contact tracing has been completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> may decide to differ from this&nbsp;process based on their professional judgement, and where possible you should follow their instructions. For example, based on their risk assessment and professional judgement, they may decide that if no further positives are found through the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> outbreak testing that the outbreak restrictions can be lifted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourteen days after the last resident or staff had a positive test result, or showed coronavirus-like symptoms, you should undertake whole home ‘outbreak recovery testing’. For outbreak recovery testing, all staff and residents (who have not tested positive in the last 90 days) should be tested with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. The regular resident testing cycle of 28 days can be delayed to coincide with this outbreak recovery testing if the two test dates fall within a week of each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are no positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results from this whole home outbreak recovery testing, the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will declare the outbreak restrictions can be lifted and the normal regular testing pattern should be followed. Any further positive cases after this point should be classed as a new potential outbreak and the care home must contact the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and immediately begin rapid response testing again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will contact the care home if they have identified a particular Variant of Concern (VOC) or Variant under Investigation (VUI), which requires additional actions/restrictions. They will discuss whether additional measures need to be put in place to enable additional protection and how this impacts the testing required. This might include delaying the whole home outbreak recovery testing until 28 days from the last positive test.</p>
  </li>

<h3>Residents and staff displaying symptoms of COVID-19</h3>

<p>If there are one or multiple individuals displaying symptoms, you should contact your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. Do not wait until you have received the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results before contacting your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Residents and staff with symptoms of coronavirus should be isolated and tested for COVID-19 immediately with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. If possible, they should also be tested with a rapid lateral flow test. The rapid lateral flow test can provide an early warning that someone is positive and inform the outbreak management approach but the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> should still be done for someone with symptoms, whether the rapid lateral flow test is positive or negative.</p>

<p>An individual who tests negative for COVID-19 but continues to have symptoms may have another infectious illness, like flu. You may need to take action to limit transmission, including the use of appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with residents and isolation while the individual is unwell.</p>

<h4>Residents with symptoms</h4>

<p>Residents who develop symptoms should be isolated immediately and need to conduct a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test provided by the setting (and if possible, a rapid lateral flow test). They should remain in self-isolation until the result of this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is communicated. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result is negative, they can come out of self-isolation.</p>

<p>Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="#positive-result">what to do in the case of a positive result</a>.</p>

<p>If residents develop new symptoms, as far as possible, residents should be isolated immediately and tested – contact your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>As far as possible, residents should be offered the choice to either self-administer the tests on themselves or to have the tests administered by a suitable member of staff.</p>

<h4>Staff with symptoms</h4>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Staff with symptoms should not be tested in the care home.</p>
</div>

<p>Staff with symptoms should instead be referred for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing at a regional or local testing centre or in their own home.</p>

<h3>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h3>

<p>If you have tested positive with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or rapid lateral flow test, the testing you undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing to undertake within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or LFD result can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Testing and vaccinations</h4>

<p>Whilst vaccination offers vital protection from severe disease, no vaccine is 100% effective, and does not prevent transmission to others from those who are infected.</p>

<p>In order to identify positive cases and continue to monitor the effects and transmission of COVID-19, we must continue to operate a comprehensive, adhered to, testing programme, even in settings where vaccines have been administered.</p>

<p>Vaccination is just one tool in our collective response and recovery from the effects of COVID-19, and so testing and other infection control measures including appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will continue to be the necessary and proportionate approach to help keep care home residents and staff safe.</p>

<h2>Prepare your care home for testing</h2>

<p>To prepare your care home make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>familiarise yourself with the testing guidance and the different types of testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>all staff who will conduct rapid lateral flow testing (rapid lateral flow test) should have completed the <a href="https://go.tessello.co.uk/TestDeviceTraining" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace online training</a> – to register for an account
    <ul>
      <li>use the following token: 3wkcVi4UTX</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that you have enough trained staff available to process the number of rapid lateral flow tests being conducted</li>
  <li>discuss the testing approach with your residents and staff. Spend time preparing residents and explaining the procedure to them</li>
  <li>obtain and record consent</li>
  <li>review your personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) supply and ensure you have the correct <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to carry out testing</li>
  <li>ensure a proper workstation is available for preparing and packing the tests</li>
  <li>look out for the delivery confirmation email letting you know when tests will be delivered</li>

<h2>Testing process overview</h2>

<h4>1. Request tests and place an order</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home" class="govuk-link">Place an order</a> of COVID-19 tests or return boxes. You will receive an email confirming your successful order of tests.</p>

<h4>2. Delivery confirmation</h4>

<p>You will receive an email confirming the test kits are scheduled for delivery.</p>

<h4>3. Receive test kits</h4>

<p>You will receive your delivery of test kits via courier after 10am. Ensure that all kits are stored safely at ambient temperature. Do not refrigerate of leave in direct sunlight.</p>

<h4>4. Testing days</h4>

<p>You can conduct your testing on days of your choice. Conduct rapid lateral flow testing for staff, ideally before starting work, on the same day that they are testing using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and then twice more every 2 to 3 days in between <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests.</p>

<h4>5. Register <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>

<p>You must register every COVID-19 test. Note the barcode number and time of each <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test against the name of the person tested. Register the completed test online as close as possible to the time of the swab. You can register <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">individually</a>, or using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">multiple upload spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h4>6. Report rapid lateral flow test results</h4>

<p>You must report the result of every rapid lateral flow test, even if it is negative or void. You can register rapid lateral flow tests <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">individually</a>, or using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">multiple upload spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" aria-label="Information" role="note">
<p>More information on <a href="#how-register" class="govuk-link">how to register tests online</a> can be found below.</p>
</div>

<h4>7. Return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits (courier)</h4>

<p>Use a courier to return 8 or more tests to the lab. You should book a courier collection for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at least a day before testing (no later than 7pm). Place completed tests in an outer return box and register the box barcode when you register each test. This links your tests to a box and helps us find your tests if they go missing.</p>

<h4>8. Return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits (by post)</h4>

<p>If you have conducted 8 or fewer tests, you should use <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits for return by priority post box. These should be placed into a Royal Mail priority post-box on the same day the test was conducted.</p>

<h4>9. Complete</h4>

<p>The regular testing process is now complete. This process is outlined in more detailed in the pages below.</p>

<h4>10. Results</h4>

<p>Full information about what to do if you receive a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or rapid lateral flow test result can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of staff and exposed patients</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance</a>. This also covers how to manage staff and residents who are a contact of someone who has tested positive.</p>

<h2>The end-to-end testing process</h2>

<p>To ensure that tests are carried out safely, you must ensure that suitably competent staff conduct the tests. Please ensure every person in the home reads the detailed instructions provided.</p>

<p>If testing a resident, take a moment to reassure them to help them feel more comfortable while you perform the test. Check nasal passages for any recent nasal surgery or abnormalities, cuts or injuries that would make swabbing difficult. Have the resident gently blow their nose and cough into a tissue to dispose of any excess mucus and dispose of the tissue immediately in a bin.</p>

<h3>Obtaining consent</h3>

<h4>Consent for residents</h4>

<p>To conduct a test on a resident you should obtain consent from them. If necessary, you should consult with family members and their GP as appropriate and in line with your usual policies and procedures.</p>

<p>Some residents, for example some people with dementia, learning disabilities or mental health conditions, may lack the relevant mental capacity to make a decision about their own testing.</p>

<p>If the person lacks the relevant mental capacity to consent to the test, and they are aged 16 or over, you should consider if the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 allow you to make a ‘best interests decision’ to swab and receive results, on their behalf.</p>

<p>As far as possible, residents should be offered the choice to either self-administer the test on themselves or to have the test administered by a suitable member of staff. Likewise, the resident should be offered the choice to receive the results directly (rather than via the registered manager on their behalf), in which case you should follow the same process set out in this guidance but using the resident’s contact details to register the test online.</p>

<h4>Consent for staff members</h4>

<p>Staff members can register both rapid lateral flow tests and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests themselves to receive the test results directly.</p>

<p>Care home managers or providers may also seek consent to register and receive test results on behalf of staff members. This consent should be given in writing. As test results are personal information no staff member should be compelled to provide consent.</p>

<h3>Placing your order</h3>

<p>Place an order of coronavirus tests or outer return boxes using the <a href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">online order portal</a>. You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your Unique Organisation Number (UON) – this is the unique 8-digit number for your care home or setting and is the gateway to access all COVID-19 services(you can use the online <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">look-up tool to find your UON</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how many staff work in your care home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how many residents (non-staff) are in your care home</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can order COVID-19 tests on the online portal every 10 days. We will calculate how many tests you need based on the staff and non-staff figures you provide. This is inclusive of a buffer provided for rapid response testing, outbreak testing and any extra care givers in your home.</p>

<p>You will be given the option to place an order for the following:</p>

<h4>Rapid lateral flow tests for staff</h4>

<p>These are Innova branded and come in green boxes of 25. The Innova 25 tests can only be used for self-testing by trained staff. These can be used on visitors and residents but only when supervised by a member of staff.</p>

<h4>Rapid lateral flow tests for non-staff</h4>

<p>These can be used by visitors and residents to self-test. You can download an overview of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1029795/How_to_use_your_rapid_lateral_flow_test_poster.pdf">different types of non-staff rapid lateral flow tests you may receive here</a>.</p>

<h4>Standard swab tests</h4>

<p>These are <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to be returned by courier for when you are testing 9 people or more. Alongside your order of standard swab tests, you will be sent larger outer return boxes. You can package up to 50 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits into these boxes when returning test kits to the lab by courier.</p>

<h4>Outer return boxes</h4>

<p>These are additional return boxes to return by courier if needed.</p>

<h4>Swab tests to be returned by priority post box</h4>

<p>These are <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests that can be put into a priority postbox and are recommended for if you’re testing 8 people or fewer.</p>

<h4>Where to go for help with orders</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about your order, please call 119. If you are close to running out of stock and require an urgent or emergency delivery, you should also call 119.</p>

<h3>Arranging your test kit courier collection</h3>

<p>If you have planned to conduct more than 8 COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests in a day you should book a courier collection. You can book a courier collection using the <a rel="external" href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">online courier booking portal</a>. You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your UON</li>
  <li>the postcode of the care home or setting</li>
</ul>

<p>You must book for next day collections before 7pm. You can book a courier up to 6 days in advance. Once you have confirmed your courier collection, you will receive your courier collection confirmation by email.</p>

<p>There is a 48-hour window to get a swab sample to the laboratory for processing. It is important that the courier collects your tests as close as possible to when the swabs were conducted. As far as possible, tests should be picked up by the courier on the same day that swabs are conducted.</p>

<h4>Where to go for help with couriers</h4>

<p>If you have any questions about your order, please call 119. There may be a small number of circumstances where you need to conduct a large number of tests urgently and have not booked a courier. This might be because you have entered outbreak or are in rapid response testing. To arrange an emergency courier booking you should call 119. If you are conducting 8 or fewer tests in a day, you should use the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for return by post and return them to the lab by posting them in your closest Royal Mail priority post box. For more information on returning test kits to the lab by post click here.</p>

<h3>Registering <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow tests</h3>

<h4>Conducting a test</h4>

<p>Always read the instructions of each test as they may be different.</p>

<p>For tests that require a nose and throat swab, a combined nose and throat swab should be taken where possible. However, a person-centred approach should be used to assess which sample to take from each resident.</p>

<p>Where a combined nose and throat swab is not possible, a nose swab from both nostrils should be taken.</p>

<h4>Registering your test(s)</h4>

<p>Every test taken must be registered. This records the barcode of each sample against the name and details of the individual who has been tested. You will not receive a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result if you do not register the test.</p>

<p>There are two ways to register COVID-19 tests, single registration, and multiple registration (using the multiple registration spreadsheet).</p>

<h4>Single registration</h4>

<p>You can register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow tests using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests">organisation testing registration portal</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can report rapid lateral flow test results <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">using the report result service</a>. This service allows you to create an NHS account to register tests quicker next time.</p>

<h4>Multiple registration</h4>

<p>Only use the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users" class="govuk-link">multiple upload spreadsheet</a> provided by NHS Test and Trace. You can register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow tests using the multiple upload spreadsheet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to use separate record keeping spreadsheets for staff and residents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must use the latest version of the spreadsheet to register tests using the multiple upload process. Please do not send any personal information along with the completed tests to the lab. This will be reported as a clinical incident and could delay getting your results back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can register up to 100 tests at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have successfully registered each <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and rapid lateral flow test you will receive a confirmation email or text message. You will receive the test results for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> by email or text within 72 hours of the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test arriving at the laboratory. You should monitor your email account carefully. Registered managers should not use a personal email or phone number to receive test results for any residents or staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you receive the test result email, this may not include the name of the resident or staff member. You should therefore retain a careful record of each test barcode and the name of the resident or staff member. Staff members should also retain a record of their own test barcode.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Setting up a handheld scanner</h4>

<p>NHS Test and Trace can provide you with a handheld scanner to speed up the test registration process. To apply for a scanner, please call 119. When setting up your scanner you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>turn off your computer’s power before connecting the scanner</li>
  <li>lug the cable into the bottom of the scanner and plug the other end into a computer</li>
  <li>turn on the computer once the scanner is fully connected</li>
  <li>the computer should recognise the scanner automatically as a USB keyboard device</li>
</ul>

<p>To register a COVID-19 test using a handheld scanner follow the normal registration process steps until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when prompted to ‘Enter the unique test kit barcode’ click the test kit barcode reference box</li>
  <li>once the cursor is live, for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test scan the test kit barcode provided on the spare sticker, plastic tube, or bag</li>
  <li>for rapid lateral flow tests, scan the QR stamp printed directly on to the top of each individual lateral flow device</li>
</ul>

<h3>Securely package and return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to the lab</h3>

<h4>Returning tests by courier</h4>

<p>When conducting more than 8 tests in a day, use the standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests for return by courier. You should aim to package your test kits before 4pm. Use one of the empty larger outer return boxes you will have received with your test kit delivery and ensure you have registered the box online along with the tests inside. Ensure you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>arranged a courier collection before you have started testing</li>
  <li>register the barcode that’s on the blue label on the large outer return box. NHS Test and Trace can track each test sample through the entire end-to-end testing process.</li>
  <li>registered every test to an outer return box</li>
  <li>packaged no more than 50 tests inside one box</li>
  <li>packaged no fewer than 9 inside one box</li>
</ul>

<h4>Returning tests by post</h4>

<p>When conducting 8 or fewer tests in a day, use the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests for postal return. You can return these to the lab using your closest Royal Mail priority post box and should be packaged in the individual boxes provided with each test kit.</p>

<p>You can find your closes priority post box using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" rel="external">Royal Mail website</a>.</p>

<h3>What to do in case of a positive result</h3>

<p>Care homes with one or more positive COVID-19 results should contact their local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. Do not delay contacting your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, interventions are more effective the earlier they are started.</p>

<p>Any individual who tests positive for coronavirus with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or rapid lateral flow test should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">management of exposed and residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also consider whether individuals may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments including antivirals or monoclonal antibodies (through the PANORAMIC national study or through <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/">direct access</a> for those at highest risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19).</p>

<p>If there are any staff or resident positives, either from rapid lateral flow test or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>, all staff should conduct a daily rapid lateral flow test before starting their shift if possible.</p>

<p>Read more about <a href="#rapid-response" class="govuk-link">rapid response daily testing</a>.</p>

<p>If there is a delay in the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> returning your call, in addition to starting rapid response daily staff testing, UKHSA and the Department of Health and Social Care recommend you ensure the case(s) are isolated and contacts identified, and managed in line with current guidance whilst awaiting a response.</p>

<p>Advice on <a href="#outbreak-testing" class="govuk-link">what to do in an outbreak situation</a> can be found below.</p>

<h2>Priority treatment tests for residents in the highest risk group</h2>

<p>From 16 December, residents of care homes who are in the highest risk group from COVID-19 will be able to access new COVID-19 treatments directly.</p>

<p>Priority treatment tests are being sent directly to these individuals to enable faster treatment of COVID-19 should they become symptomatic.</p>

<p>These tests will be addressed to the individual and sent in a purple postal bag.</p>

<p>Residents will receive a ‘pre-notification’ letter or email (to the contact details specified in their GP record) to alert them that they have a condition that may make them eligible should they test positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Service and care managers are requested to support residents with where to store these priority tests so that they are available when needed. Each priority treatment test kit will have an information leaflet enclosed which details how these kits should be stored and provide full testing instructions.</p>

<h4>What to do if a resident in the highest risk group becomes symptomatic</h4>

<p>If the resident becomes symptomatic the priority treatment test should be used.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the registration instructions in the test kit and use the individual’s NHS number if available (to help trigger the treatment process).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send the test kit via a Royal Mail priority post box (using a courier will get a slower result given the way the priority red boxes are processed).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If positive for COVID-19, the resident will be contacted by a COVID-19 medicines delivery unit clinician who will assess the resident’s eligibility and decide on the appropriate treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases the treatment prescribed will be monoclonal antibodies, which are given intravenously, however if monoclonal antibodies are unsuitable for the individual, they will be given oral antivirals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the resident is not contacted within 24 hours of receiving the positive result, contact their GP or call 111.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
