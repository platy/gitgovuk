<h4>Changes in this publication</h4>
<p>Updated to reflect ththat there is no longer a legal requirement for people with coronavirus (COVID-19) infection to self-isolate, however the public health advice for people with any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test result is to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Due to the higher risk nature of health and social care settings, the advice for staff member working in these settings has not changed.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is for care home managers and providers to set out the current policy for regular asymptomatic and outbreak testing in care homes. Based on the latest clinical advice, the aim of this policy is to enable positive cases to be identified quickly, enabling action to stop the spread. We will keep this guidance under review as the situation changes.</p>

<p>Providing testing within all adult care homes will help you protect your residents and staff and is an important part of the national effort to tackle COVID-19. This testing policy applies to everyone regardless of vaccination status. Thank you for everything you are doing to help the country beat the virus at this hugely challenging time.</p>

<h2>Testing guidance for staff and residents</h2>

<h3>Regular testing for staff</h3>

<p>You should test all asymptomatic staff daily using a rapid lateral flow test (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) before their shift begins on the days they are working.</p>

<h3>Regular testing for residents</h3>

<p>You should test all asymptomatic residents monthly using a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit. Further testing may be required for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus">visits in and out of the care home</a> or if a resident is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes">exposed to COVID-19 or is a new admission</a>.</p>

<h4>Regular testing pattern – overview</h4>

<p>Asymptomatic regular testing for staff and residents. Staff should test every day that they are working. The below diagram is based on a Monday to Friday working pattern – the exact testing days will vary according to shift patterns.</p>

<h3>Residents and staff displaying symptoms of COVID-19</h3>

<p>If there are 2 or more individuals displaying symptoms, you should contact your local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>).</p>

<p>Residents with symptoms of COVID-19 should be isolated and tested for COVID-19 immediately, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Do not wait until you have received the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results before contacting your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. Staff with symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home and conduct their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test in their own home or go to an in-person test site. Following a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, residents can also be tested with an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> for speed of detection. The <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> can provide an early warning that someone is positive and inform the outbreak management approach, whilst awaiting their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result. If either the <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, the resident should be treated as having COVID-19.</p>

<p>An individual who tests negative for COVID-19 but continues to have symptoms may have another infectious illness, like flu. You may need to take action to limit transmission, including the use of appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when working with residents and ensure those who are unwell avoid contact with others.</p>

<h3>Residents with symptoms</h3>

<p>Residents who develop symptoms should be isolated immediately and need to conduct a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test provided by the setting (and if possible, an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>). As far as possible, residents should be offered the choice to either self-administer the tests on themselves or to have the tests administered by a suitable member of staff. They should remain in self-isolation until the result of this <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is communicated. If the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result is negative, they can come out of self-isolation.</p>

<p>If residents develop new symptoms, as far as possible, residents should be isolated immediately and tested – contact your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>For residents in the highest risk group eligible for COVID-19 treatments, see final section of this guidance.</p>

<h3>Staff with symptoms</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Staff with symptoms should not be tested in the care home.<br><br>
Staff with symptoms should instead be referred for PCR testing at a regional or local test centre or in their own home and should stay at home.</p>
</div>

<h2>What to do in case of a positive result</h2>

<p>Care homes with one or more positive COVID-19 results should contact their local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. Do not delay contacting your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, interventions are more effective the earlier they are started.</p>

<p>Staff who test positive for COVID-19 should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If a resident tests positive for COVID-19, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes#reporting-of-covid-19-cases-caring-for-residents-with-covid-19-and-outbreak-management">admissions and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19 guidance</a>.</p>

<p>You should also consider whether individuals may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments including antivirals or monoclonal antibodies (through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.panoramictrial.org/" rel="external">PANORAMIC national study</a> or through direct access for those at highest risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19). <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/" rel="external">Further information on treatments for COVID-19</a> is available on the NHS website. Any queries regarding priority treatment tests can be raised via 119.</p>

<p>If there is a delay in the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> returning your call, continue to follow current guidance to isolate the individual(s) and identify contacts whilst awaiting a response.</p>

<p>Advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/covid-19-care-home-testing-guidance-for-regular-and-outbreak-testing-of-staff-and-residents#outbreak-testing">what to do in an outbreak situation</a> can be found below.</p>

<h2>Outbreak testing</h2>

<h3>Definition of a care home outbreak</h3>

<p>An outbreak consists of 2, or more, positive (or clinically suspected) cases of COVID-19 during a 14-day period. This applies to both staff and residents and includes <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results. If you have one or more positive cases (or multiple symptomatic individuals), contact your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> for advice. One positive test result may be the first sign of an outbreak, so you should also contact your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> for advice in this instance.</p>

<p>The testing process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Book couriers for collecting <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests on day 1 and for one collection between days 4 to 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for all staff and residents, once on day 1 of the outbreak and once between days 4 and 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you carry out the outbreak <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for residents (day 1 and once again between days 4 to 7), also test the resident with a <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> on the same day. If either test is positive, assume the resident has COVID-19.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test any newly symptomatic residents, with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to isolate residents and ensure contact tracing has been completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> may decide to differ from this process based on their professional judgement, and where possible you should follow their instructions. For example, based on their risk assessment and professional judgement, they may decide that if no further positive cases are found through the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> outbreak testing that the outbreak restrictions can be lifted.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: the second round of outbreak <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can take place on any day between day 4 and 7 - the above example shows these taking place on day 4.</p>

<p>Staff should do daily <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> on working days only.</p>

<p>Once the care home has completed the first week of outbreak testing as above, continue daily asymptomatic <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> for staff.</p>

<p>When there have been 14 days with no new positive cases, conduct outbreak recovery testing.</p>

<h3>Outbreak recovery testing</h3>

<p>You should undertake whole home ‘outbreak recovery testing’ 14 days after the last resident or staff had a positive test result or showed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/" rel="external">COVID-19 symptoms</a>. For outbreak recovery testing, all staff, and residents (who have not tested positive in the last 90 days) should be tested with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. The regular resident testing cycle of 28 days can be delayed, to coincide with this ‘outbreak recovery testing’, if the 2 test dates fall within a week of each other.</p>

<p>If there are no positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results from this whole home ‘outbreak recovery testing’, the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will declare the outbreak restrictions can be lifted and the normal regular testing pattern should be followed. Any further positive cases after this point should be classed as a new potential outbreak and the care home must contact the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will contact the care home if they have identified a particular Variant of Concern/Variant under Investigation which requires additional actions/restrictions. They will discuss whether additional measures need to be put in place to enable additional protection and how this impacts the testing required. This might include delaying the whole home ‘outbreak recovery testing’ until 28 days from the last positive test.</p>

<h3>Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h3>

<p>If an individual has tested positive with an <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, the testing they undertake in the following 90 days may be different.</p>

<p>Any member of staff who tests positive for COVID-19 with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed residents guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If a resident tests positive for COVID-19, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes#reporting-of-covid-19-cases-caring-for-residents-with-covid-19-and-outbreak-management">admissions and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19 guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Testing and vaccinations</h3>

<p>Whilst vaccination offers vital protection from severe disease, no vaccine is 100% effective, and does not prevent transmission to others from those who are infected.</p>

<p>To identify positive cases and continue to monitor the effects and transmission of COVID-19, we must continue to operate a comprehensive, adhered to, testing programme, even in settings where vaccines have been administered.</p>

<p>Vaccination is just one tool in our collective response and recovery from the effects of COVID-19, and so testing and other infection control measures including the use of appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> will continue to be the necessary and proportionate approach to help keep care home residents and staff safe.</p>

<h2>Prepare your care home for testing</h2>

<p>To prepare your care home make sure you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarise yourself with the testing guidance and the different types of testing</li>
  <li>all staff should have completed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://go.tessello.co.uk/TestDeviceTraining" rel="external">NHS Test and Trace online training</a> if using tests that come in boxes of 25s</li>
  <li>use the token ‘3wkcVi4UTX’ to register for an account – ensure that you have enough trained staff available to process the number of <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> being conducted</li>
  <li>discuss the testing approach with your residents and staff – spend time preparing residents and explaining the procedure to them</li>
  <li>obtain and record consent</li>
  <li>review your personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) supply and ensure you have the correct <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to carry out testing</li>
  <li>ensure a proper workstation is available for preparing and packing the tests</li>
  <li>look out for the delivery confirmation email letting you know when tests will be delivered
have a workflow to allow tests to be easily registered, conducted, and reported as swiftly as possible – it is recommended to have 2 staff members; one to conduct the test and the other to complete registration</li>
  <li>(if you have received a <a class="govuk-link" href="#handheld-scanner">handheld scanner</a> for easier registration) make sure you have set it up and familiarised your staff with how to use it</li>
  <li>(if using a courier to return your <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits to the lab) have booked a courier collection for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests by 7pm the day before you start testing, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">using the online courier booking portal</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing process overview</h2>

<h4>1. Request tests and place an order</h4>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home">Place an order of COVID-19 tests</a> or return boxes. You will receive an email confirming your successful order of tests.</p>

<h4>2. Delivery confirmation</h4>
<p>You will receive an email confirming the test kits are scheduled for delivery.</p>

<h4>3. Receive test kits</h4>
<p>You will receive your delivery of test kits via courier after 10am. Ensure that all kits are stored safely at ambient temperature. Do not refrigerate or leave in direct sunlight.</p>

<h4>4. Testing days</h4>
<p>Staff should conduct <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> every day they are working, before starting their shift. Monthly resident <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing can be conducted on days of your choice.</p>

<h4>5. Report <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results</h4>
<p>You must report the result of every <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result, even if it is negative or void. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">register <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> individually</a>, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" rel="external">register them using the multiple upload spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>Providers do not need to retain records of proof of registrations.</p>

<h4>6. Register <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests (resident and outbreak testing)</h4>
<p>You must register every COVID-19 test. Note the barcode number and time of each <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test against the name of the person tested. Register the completed test online as close as possible to the time of the swab. You can register <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests individually, or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" rel="external">register them using the multiple upload spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="link%20to%20below">how to register tests online</a> can be found below.</p>
</div>

<h4>7. Return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits (courier – 9 or more tests)</h4>
<p>Use a courier to return 9 or more tests to the lab. You should book a courier collection for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests at least a day before testing (no later than 7pm). Place completed tests in an outer return box and register the box barcode when you register each test. This links your tests to a box and helps us find your tests if they go missing.</p>

<h4>8. Return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits (by post – 8 or fewer tests)</h4>
<p>If you have conducted 8 or fewer tests, you should use <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits for return by priority post box. These should be placed into a Royal Mail priority post-box on the same day the test was conducted.</p>

<h4>9. The testing process is complete</h4>
<p>The regular testing process is now complete. The testing process is outlined in more detail below.</p>

<h4>10. Results</h4>
<p>Full information about what to do if you receive a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> or <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed patients guidance</a>. This also covers how to manage staff and residents who are a contact of someone who has tested positive.</p>

<h4>11. Priority treatment tests</h4>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#priority-treatment">Priority treatment tests</a> are being sent directly to individuals who are in the highest risk group from COVID-19, to enable faster treatment of COVID-19 should they become symptomatic. More information on priority treatment tests for residents in the highest risk group is in the final section of this guidance.</p>

<h2>Step-by-step guide</h2>

<p>To make sure that tests are carried out safely, you must ensure that suitably competent staff conduct the tests. Please ensure every person in the home reads the detailed instructions provided.</p>

<p>It is recommended that residents who would prefer to self-administer the test on themselves should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCqo7MhQT6U" rel="external">watch this self-swabbing instruction video</a>, as should staff. Staff are expected to self-swab.</p>

<p>If testing a resident, take a moment to reassure them to help them feel more comfortable while you perform the test. Check nasal passages for any recent nasal surgery or abnormalities, cuts or injuries that would make swabbing difficult. Have the resident gently blow their nose and cough into a tissue to dispose of any excess mucus and dispose of the tissue immediately in a bin.</p>

<h2>Obtaining consent</h2>

<h3>Consent for residents</h3>

<p>To conduct a test on a resident you should obtain consent from them. If necessary, you should consult with family members and their GP as appropriate and in line with your usual policies and procedures.</p>

<p>Some residents, for example some people with dementia, learning disabilities or mental health conditions, may lack the relevant mental capacity to decide about their own testing.</p>

<p>If the person lacks the relevant mental capacity to consent to the test, and they are aged 16 or over, you should consider if the principles of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> allow you to make a ‘best interests decision’ to swab and receive results, on their behalf.</p>

<p>As far as possible, residents should be offered the choice to either self-administer the test on themselves or to have the test administered by a suitable member of staff. Likewise, the resident should be offered the choice to receive the results directly (rather than via the registered manager on their behalf), in which case you should follow the same process set out in this guidance but using the resident’s contact details to register the test online.</p>

<h3>Consent for staff members</h3>
<p>Staff members can register both <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests themselves to receive the test results directly.</p>

<p>Care home managers or providers may also seek consent to register and receive test results on behalf of staff members. This consent should be given in writing. As test results are personal information no staff member should be compelled to provide consent.</p>

<h2>Placing your order</h2>

<p>Place an order of COVID-19 tests or outer return boxes using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">online order portal</a>.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>) – this is the unique 8-digit number for your care home or setting and is the gateway to access all COVID-19 services. You can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">online look-up tool to find your <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr></a>.</li>
  <li>The number of staff and essential care givers in your care home.</li>
  <li>The number of residents (non-staff) that are in your care home.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can order COVID-19 tests on the online portal every 10 days. We will calculate how many tests you need based on the staff and non-staff figures you provide. This is inclusive of a buffer provided for outbreak testing.</p>

<p>You will be given the option to place an order for the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> for staff – if these are Innova branded and come in green boxes of 25, they can only be used for self-testing by trained staff or on visitors and residents when supervised by a member of staff. If you receive other self-test kits, they can be used for anyone.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> for non-staff – these can be used by visitors and residents to self-test. You can download an overview of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1029795/How_to_use_your_rapid_lateral_flow_test_poster.pdf" rel="external">different types of non-staff <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> you may receive here</a>.</li>
  <li>Standard swab tests – these are <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to be returned by courier for when you are testing 9 people or more. Alongside your order of standard swab tests, you will be sent larger outer return boxes. You can package up to 50 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits into these boxes when returning test kits to the lab by courier.</li>
  <li>Outer return boxes – these are additional return boxes to return by courier if needed.</li>
  <li>Swab tests to be returned by priority post box – these are <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests that can be put into a priority post box and are recommended for if you’re testing 8 people or fewer.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Where to go for help with orders</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about your order, please call 119. If you are close to running out of stock and require an urgent and emergency delivery, you should also call 119.</p>

<h3>Arranging your test kit courier collection</h3>

<p>If you have planned to conduct more than 8 COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests in a day you should book a courier collection. You can book a courier collection using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://test-kit-collection.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">online courier booking portal</a>. You will need your <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> and the postcode of the care home or setting.</p>

<p>You must book for next day collections before 7pm. You can book a courier up to 6 days in advance. Once you have confirmed your courier collection, you will receive your courier collection confirmation by email.</p>

<p>There is a 48-hour window to get a swab sample to the laboratory for processing. It is important that the courier collects your tests as close as possible to when the swabs were conducted. As far as possible, tests should be picked up by the courier on the same day that swabs are conducted.</p>

<h4>Where to go for help with couriers</h4>
<p>If you have any questions about your order, please call 119. There may be a small number of circumstances where you need to conduct many tests urgently and have not booked a courier. This might be because you have entered an outbreak. To arrange an emergency courier booking you should call 119. If you are conducting 8 or fewer tests in a day, you should use the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for return by post, and return them to the lab by posting them in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" rel="external">closest Royal Mail priority post box</a>.</p>

<h2>Registering PCRs and <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>
</h2>

<h3>Conducting a test</h3>

<p>Always read the instructions of each test as they may be different.</p>

<p>For tests that require a nose and throat swab, a combined nose and throat swab should be taken where possible. However, a person-centred approach should be used to assess which sample to take from each resident.</p>

<p>Where a combined nose and throat swab is not possible, a nose swab from both nostrils should be taken.</p>

<h3>Registering your test(s)</h3>

<p>Every test taken must be registered. This records the barcode of each sample against the name and details of the individual who has been tested. You will not receive a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result if you do not register for the test.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways to register COVID-19 tests, single registration, and multiple registration (using the multiple registration spreadsheet).</p>

<h4>Single registration</h4>
<p>You can register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-testing-for-organisations.service.gov.uk/register-organisation-tests" rel="external">organisation testing registration portal</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can report <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> results <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">using the report result service</a>. This service allows you to create an NHS account to register tests quicker next time.</p>

<h4>Multiple registration</h4>
<p>Only use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">multiple upload spreadsheet</a> provided by NHS Test and Trace. You can register both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> using the multiple upload spreadsheet.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to use separate record keeping spreadsheets for staff and residents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You must use the latest version of the spreadsheet to register tests using the multiple upload process. Please do not send any personal information along with the completed tests to the lab. This will be reported as a clinical incident and could delay getting your results back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can register up to 100 tests at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have successfully registered each <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> you will receive a confirmation email or text message. You will receive the test results for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> by email or text within 72 hours of the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test arriving at the laboratory. You should monitor your email account carefully. Registered managers should not use a personal email or phone number to receive test results for any residents or staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you receive the test result email, this may not include the name of the resident or staff member. You should therefore retain a careful record of each test barcode and the name of the resident or staff member. Staff members should also retain a record of their own test barcode.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Setting up a handheld scanner</h4>
<p>NHS Test and Trace can provide you with a handheld scanner to speed up the test registration process. To apply for a scanner, please call 119. When setting up your scanner you should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn off your computer’s power before connecting the scanner.</li>
  <li>Plug the cable into the bottom of the scanner and plug the other end into a computer.</li>
  <li>Turn on the computer once the scanner is fully connected.</li>
  <li>The computer should recognise the scanner automatically as a USB keyboard device.</li>
</ol>

<p>To register a COVID-19 test using a handheld scanner follow the normal registration process steps until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when prompted to ‘Enter the unique test kit barcode’ click the test kit barcode reference box</li>
  <li>once the cursor is live, for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test scan the test kit barcode provided on the spare sticker, plastic tube, or bag</li>
  <li>for rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr>, scan the QR stamp printed directly on to the top of each individual <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device</li>
</ul>

<h3>Securely package and return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests to the lab</h3>

<h4>Returning tests by courier</h4>
<p>When conducting more than 8 tests in a day, use the standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests for return by courier. Use one of the empty larger outer return boxes you will have received with your test kit delivery and ensure you have registered the box online along with the tests inside. Make certain you have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Arranged a courier collection before you have started testing.</li>
  <li>Registered the barcode that’s on the blue label on the large outer return box. NHS Test and Trace can track each test sample through the entire end-to-end testing process.</li>
  <li>Registered every test to an outer return box.</li>
  <li>Packaged no more than 50 tests inside one box.</li>
  <li>Packaged no fewer than 9 inside one box.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Returning tests by post</h4>
<p>When conducting 8 or fewer tests in a day, use the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests for postal return. You can return these to the lab using your closest Royal Mail priority post box and should be packaged in the individual boxes provided with each test kit.</p>

<p>You can find your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you" rel="external">closest priority post box using the Royal Mail website</a>.</p>

<h2>Priority treatment tests for residents in the highest risk group</h2>

<p>Residents of care homes who are in the highest risk group from COVID-19 can access new COVID-19 treatments directly.</p>

<p>Priority treatment <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are being sent directly to these individuals to enable faster treatment of COVID-19 should they become symptomatic.</p>

<p>These tests will be addressed to the individual and sent in a purple postal bag.</p>

<p>Residents will receive a ‘pre-notification’ letter or email (to the contact details specified in their GP record) to alert them that they have a condition that may make them eligible should they test positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Service and care managers are requested to support residents with where to store these priority tests so that they are available when needed. Each priority treatment test kit will have an information leaflet enclosed which details how these kits should be stored and provide full testing instructions.</p>

<h4>What to do if a resident in the highest risk group becomes symptomatic</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If the resident becomes symptomatic, the priority treatment test should be used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the registration instructions in the test kit and use the individual’s NHS number if available (to help trigger the treatment process).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send the test kit via a Royal Mail priority post box (using a courier will get a slower result given the way the priority red boxes are processed).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If positive for COVID-19, the resident will be contacted by a COVID-19 medicines delivery unit clinician who will assess the resident’s eligibility and decide on the appropriate treatment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In most cases the treatment prescribed will be monoclonal antibodies, which are given intravenously, however, if monoclonal antibodies are unsuitable for the individual, they will be given oral antivirals.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If the resident is not contacted within 24 hours of receiving the positive result, contact their GP or call 111.</p>

<p>Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/" rel="external">information on treatments for COVID-19</a> is available on the NHS website.
Any queries regarding priority treatment tests can be raised via 119.</p>
