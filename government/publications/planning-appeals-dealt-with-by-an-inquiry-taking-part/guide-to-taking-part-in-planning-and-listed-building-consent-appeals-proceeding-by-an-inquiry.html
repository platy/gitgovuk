<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1. This guide explains how, if you are interested in the outcome of an appeal, you can make your views known.</p>

<p>1.2. Please note - there are separate guides for appeals that are proceeding by the written representations or hearing process. <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">You can access all our guides through GOV.UK</a>.</p>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who decides an appeal and what are the rules?</h2>

<p>2.1. Planning and listed building consent applications are made to the local planning authority (LPA) which will usually be the local council but may be a National Park Authority. Appeals are made to us and may be made for a number of reasons, but most are made because the LPA has refused permission or consent.</p>

<p>2.2. Nearly all appeals are decided by our Inspectors; a very small percentage are decided by the Secretary of State - these tend to be the very large or contentious proposals.</p>

<p>2.3. For:</p>

<p>(a) an appeal in relation to an application for planning permission; or
  (b) an appeal in relation to listed building consent;</p>

<p>the inquiry is held under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Town and Country Planning Appeals (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000/1625 (as amended)</li>
</ul>

<p>and the very few appeals decided by the Secretary of State are held under:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000/1624 (as amended).</li>
</ul>

<p>2.4. The Business and Planning Act 2020 now provides greater flexibility, allowing appeal procedures to be combined. If we have decided initially that an appeal should follow the inquiry procedure, we may subsequently also consider whether a ‘combined procedure’, with some issues dealt with by hearing (round table discussion) and/or written representations, may be appropriate.</p>

<p>2.5. If a ‘combined procedure’ is decided upon, how the combined procedure should operate is at our discretion  on a case by case basis.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How you find out about the appeal</h2>

<p>3.1. If you wrote to the LPA about the planning application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it should write to tell you about the appeal after we have accepted it as valid; and</li>
  <li>when the arrangements have been made for the inquiry it should let you know when and where it will take place.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2. The appellant must display details of the inquiry, including the time and place, on the site of the proposed development 2 weeks before the inquiry.</p>

<p>3.3. These are the minimum publicity requirements. Your LPA may give appeals more publicity and will probably put information on its website. It may publish details of the inquiry in a local newspaper if it thinks it is necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The inquiry procedure</h2>

<p>4.1. At:</p>

<p>Annexe A there is a timetable for planning appeals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appeals where the local planning authority has taken enforcement action so the 28 days appeal period applies see paragraph 2.4.3 of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide - Planning appeals - England” (except householder appeals)</a>;</li>
  <li>for householder and minor commercial development appeals which we determine are not suitable for the Part 1 written representations process and that an inquiry is necessary; and</li>
  <li>which are recovered for the Secretary of State to make the decision (rather than one of our Inspectors).</li>
</ul>

<p>Annexe B there is a timetable for planning appeals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not a ‘recovered’ appeal;</li>
  <li>the time limit of 28 days does not apply where the local planning authority has taken enforcement action (as explained in paragraph 2.4.3 of our “Procedural Guide - Planning appeals - England”;</li>
  <li>it is not an appeal where we have determined that the appeal is not suitable for written representations under the Part 1 process and that an inquiry is necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What you can do</h2>

<p>5.1. The LPA will send us copies of any letters of support or objection it received about the application while considering it. These will be fully considered by the Inspector who decides the appeal.</p>

<p>5.2. If you did not write at application stage, or you did write and now have something new to say, you can send us your representations about the appeal.</p>

<p>5.3. You should be able to see copies of the appeal documents, including the appellant’s representations at the LPA’s offices before the deadline for you to make your comments.</p>

<p>5.4. The time limit for sending representations to us is important, and everyone taking part in an appeal must follow it. <strong>If you send us representations after the end of the time limit, we will not normally accept them. Instead we will return them to you. This means that the Inspector will not see them and so will not be able to take them into account.</strong></p>

<p>5.5. So you <strong>must</strong> make sure that we receive your representations within the deadline given by the LPA when it notified you of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.6. When you send us your representations you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address;</li>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate appeal reference number (this will start APP/…);</li>
  <li>the address of the appeal site;</li>
</ul>

<p>and say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I am against the appeal proposals’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appeal proposals’ and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.7. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/appeal-planning-inspectorate">make your representations online through GOV.UK using the search facility</a> or you can write to or email us. The LPA should have told you our case officer’s contact details. Our case officer is responsible for the administration of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.8. If you send us your representations in a letter, unless your handwriting is very clear it would help if you are able to have your representations typed. Please use <strong>black</strong> ink. Please note that we do not acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>5.9. We will copy your representations to the appellant, to any statutory parties and to the LPA (we refer to these as “the main parties”) where they will be available for anyone to see them.</p>

<p>5.10. However, if we consider that your representations contain inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, we will send them back to you before the Inspector or anyone else sees them. If you take out the inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, you can send your representations back to us; <strong>but</strong> you must send them back before the time limit ends.</p>

<p>5.11. We do not accept anonymous representations, but you may ask for your name and address to be withheld. If you ask us to do this you should make sure that your representations do not include any other information which may identify you. We will copy your representations, with your name and address removed, to the main parties, and they will be seen by the Inspector who may give them less weight as a result.</p>

<p>5.12. If you indicate that you do not want us to copy your representations to the main parties we will return them. They will not be seen by the Inspector and, therefore, will not be taken into account. This is because the Inspector can only take into account representations which have been copied to the main parties and are available to be seen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What is considered?</h2>

<p>6.1. The Inspector can only take into account information and evidence that is relevant to the appeal. This could cover a wide range of issues, but those that apply are usually set out in the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>If you decide to send documents to support your representations</h2>

<p>7.1. Please note that we are unable to return any documents or photographs.</p>

<p>7.2. Please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font such as Arial or Verdana in a size of 11 point or larger;</li>
  <li>use <strong>A4</strong> paper wherever possible;</li>
  <li>number the pages of the documents;</li>
  <li>make sure photocopied and scanned documents are clear and legible;</li>
  <li>use black and white for documents unless colour is essential;</li>
  <li>put any photographs (both originals and photocopies should be in colour), maps, plans, etc, in a <strong>separate</strong> appendix and cross- reference them within the main body of the document;</li>
  <li>print documents on both sides of a page. You should use paper of good enough quality that something printed on one side of the page does not show through to the other side;</li>
  <li>ensure that the scale and orientation of any maps and plans are shown clearly. If you are sending maps or plans by email or through GOV.UK you <strong>MUST</strong> tell us the paper size;</li>
  <li>do not send original documents unless we specifically ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3. Please see Annexe I: “Communicating electronically with us” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>for additional guidance about sending us documents electronically or by email.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Audio/video evidence</h2>

<p>8.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the inquiry. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, the appellant, statutory parties, any Rule 6 (6) party (see paragraph 9.6) and the LPA. Please send within the 5 week deadline for representations. Also you may ask the Inspector at the inquiry if he or she is willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the inquiry.</p>

<p>8.2. It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>8.3. If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the appellant, the LPA, and all those entitled to appear at the inquiry. Our case officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Before the inquiry</h2>

<p>9.1. Local people are encouraged to take part in the inquiry process. Local knowledge and opinion can often be a valuable addition to the evidence given by the appellant and the LPA.</p>

<p>9.2. The appellant and LPA should jointly prepare a statement of common ground. This should list all agreed matters and should include basic facts such as the site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, and as many other matters as possible relating to the application.</p>

<p>9.3. Before going to the inquiry, if you want to see everything that the appellant and the LPA have written, you will be able to see copies of all the appeal documents at the LPA’s offices.</p>

<p>9.4. Depending on whether you oppose or support the appeal you may wish to consult the LPA or the appellant to find out what their position will be at the inquiry to help you decide whether your position can be satisfactorily represented by them.</p>

<p>9.5. Inquiries are open to members of the public, and although you do not have a legal right to speak, the Inspector will normally allow you to do so. If you want to speak at the inquiry, you need to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Some people prefer to make, or read out, a brief statement giving their views. If there are several people with the same views, it is a good idea for one person to speak on behalf of the others. A group of interested people may appoint one agent, solicitor, or barrister (who would be their “advocate”) - to represent them all.</p>

<p>9.6. If you/the group want to take a leading role in the inquiry and call your own witnesses, you should contact us immediately. Under Rule 6(6) (of the Inquiries Procedure Rules) we may require you/the group to provide a statement of case before the inquiry which should include details of any documents you will produce at the inquiry. If we ask for this information, and you provide it, we will arrange for copies of the appellant’s and LPA’s statements to be sent to you.</p>

<p>9.7. For further information please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/apply-for-rule-6-status-on-a-planning-appeal-or-called-in-application">“Guide to Rule 6 for interested parties involved in an inquiry – planning appeals and called-in applications – England” on GOV.UK</a></p>

<p>9.8. The starting time for the first day of the inquiry will normally be 10:00, but the notification letter you receive from the LPA and the notice displayed on the site will contain the starting time for the particular inquiry so you should check this.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Inquiry venue</h2>

<p>10.1. We ask the LPA to arrange the inquiry venue. Inquiries are usually held in LPA offices, village halls or community centres. We have set out the facilities that an inquiry venue should include. You can access our document <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/setting-up-a-venue-for-a-public-inquiry-hearing-or-examination">“The venue and facilities for public inquiries and hearings” on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>10.2. The Planning Inspectorate has previously conducted hearings and inquiries on a face-to-face basis, with participants being physically present at a venue such as a council office or town hall. However, in order to keep staff and customers safe during the current pandemic while still progressing casework, we have had to convert our hearings and inquiries into ‘virtual’ events where participants connect remotely to an online video conference. (In a very limited number of cases we may also be able to offer a ‘blended’ event which has both physical and virtual elements). Please refer to our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-inspectorate-virtual-events-guide-to-participating">‘Guide to taking part in planning, listed building, enforcement and specialist casework appeals proceeding by a virtual hearing or inquiry – England’</a>. However, the guidance in this document about taking part in inquiries applies equally to virtual events.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>People with disabilities</h2>

<p>11.1. We want to hold all inquiries in buildings with proper facilities for people with disabilities. If you, or anyone you know, want to go to the inquiry and you have particular needs, please contact the LPA to confirm that it can make proper arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Openness and transparency</h2>

<p>12.1. Inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>12.2. If you want to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, you should contact us and the LPA in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>What happens at the inquiry?</h2>

<p>13.1. An inquiry is the most formal of the appeal procedures, because it usually involves larger or more complicated appeals. These are often cases where expert evidence is presented, and witnesses are cross-examined (questioned). An inquiry may last for several days, or even weeks. It is not a court of law, but the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar.</p>

<p>13.2. The parties may be formally represented by advocates. As well as the appellant and the LPA, some interested parties (statutory parties and Rule 6 (6) parties) are entitled to appear and give evidence.</p>

<p>13.3. The inquiry procedure allows for the presentation of detailed and technical evidence and for the cross examination of expert and other witnesses by the opposing party. The Inspector will take an inquisitorial role to ensure that evidence is thoroughly tested so that she/he can make a properly reasoned decision.</p>

<p>13.4. At the start of the inquiry the Inspector will agree the sitting times and starting times. It is often agreed that the inquiry will start at an earlier time on subsequent days. Inquiries usually sit until about 17:00 or 17:30 each day. There will usually be a mid-morning and mid-afternoon break and a 1 hour adjournment for lunch. The Inspector should not be approached during breaks because other participants in the inquiry would not know what was being said.</p>

<p>13.5. An evening inquiry session is sometimes held if there are a significant number of interested people who cannot attend during the daytime inquiry sessions. This is at the discretion of the Inspector and dependant on there being a suitable inquiry venue.</p>

<p>13.6. If you want to speak at the inquiry, it is important that you are there when it opens, because this is when the Inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>go through some routine matters;</li>
  <li>tell everyone about the timetable and the order that the proceedings will take; and</li>
  <li>ask if any interested people want to speak at the inquiry and will register their names.</li>
</ul>

<p>13.7. Interested people may appear and give evidence at the Inspector’s discretion. An Inspector would rarely refuse a request to appear at the inquiry.</p>

<p>13.8. At this stage, you should only give your name and address, and say whether you are for or against the appeal (or taking a neutral stance).</p>

<p>13.9. The Inspector will then usually give an outline of what the case is about and what the main issues are that need to be covered/dealt with. At a long inquiry, it is difficult to predict at what stage interested people will be given the chance to speak (normally you will speak after all the evidence of the appellant and the LPA has been heard). If you cannot stay at the inquiry all the time, tell the Inspector at this stage. The Inspector will understand and will try to help by hearing your representations at a different stage of the inquiry, if that is possible. However, if you wish to ask one of the main parties questions, you will need to arrange to be at the inquiry when they are giving their evidence.</p>

<p>13.10. The Inspector has the discretion to decide the order of appearances at the inquiry. However, paragraphs 13.11 to 13.14 give an order of appearances an inquiry will often follow.</p>

<p>13.11. The appellant (or their advocate) will usually be asked to make a brief (10 to 15 minutes) opening statement first, to set the scene and describe the proposal. The LPA will then make its brief opening statement. Each of the LPA’s witnesses will then give their evidence in turn. After giving evidence each will be cross-examined (questioned) by the appellant or their advocate. After each cross-examination the Inspector will normally then give the opportunity for anyone who has indicated their support for the proposals to ask questions. The witness will be re-examined by the LPA or its advocate.</p>

<p>13.12. Sometimes interested people opposed to the proposals, who have indicated that they wish to speak, will be invited to present their evidence at this point. On other occasions this evidence is heard after the case for the appellant. Unless they have indicated that they are not prepared to answer questions (see paragraph 16.3), interested people may be asked questions by the appellant or their advocate.</p>

<p>13.13. The appellant or their advocate will then present their case, following the same procedure. Each if their witnesses in turn will give evidence and be cross-examined by the LPA. The Inspector will normally then give the opportunity for anyone who has indicated their opposition to the proposals to ask questions. Each witness will then be re-examined by the appellant or their advocate.</p>

<p>13.14. Any interested people who support the proposals and who have indicated that they wish to speak will be invited to present their evidence at this point. Unless they have indicated that they are not prepared to answer questions, they may be asked questions by the LPA or its advocate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Inspector’s questions</h2>

<p>14.1. At any stage during proceedings - but normally after cross examination and re-examination of a witness has taken place - the Inspector may ask questions. Questions may be put to all those who give evidence, including interested people.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span>Re-examination</h2>

<p>15.1. As explained in paragraphs 13.11 and 13.13 after cross-examination, the advocate is allowed to re-examine each of their witnesses. If a witness has made a mistake or got in a muddle during their cross-examination, their advocate can try to correct things by discussing the subject again and asking further questions of their witness to ensure that their case is clarified. It is not the function of re-examination to invite the witness to revisit clear answers given in cross-examination. No ‘new’ evidence can be put forward and leading questions ie a question in which the answer is suggested by the question, are not normally allowed (for example “Would you agree that…”).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Giving evidence on oath</h2>

<p>16.1. Where the inquiry involves a dispute between the appellant and the LPA about the facts it is usual for the evidence to be given under oath (which the Inspector will administer) or after ‘affirming’. If your evidence/representations concerns facts you will be required to give your evidence/representations under oath or an affirmation.</p>

<p>16.2. Inspectors will, where possible, seek early confirmation from the appeal parties if any witness to be called needs to swear on a religious text. If so, the appeal party will be asked to bring the relevant Holy Book to the Inquiry. LPAs may be asked to provide a copy of the necessary text.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>Taking part in the inquiry</h2>

<p>17.1. If you told the Inspector at the start of the inquiry that you wanted to speak, and you decide to ask any of the witnesses a question (or questions) you must make sure that your questions are relevant to the evidence the witness has given. You should not repeat questions that have already been asked.</p>

<p>17.2. When the cases for the main parties have been completed, at the Inspector’s discretion, anyone who is interested in the appeal usually has the chance to speak and present their case.</p>

<p>17.3. When you give your views you should not repeat arguments that you have already made in written representations, or which someone has already said, as this does not help the Inspector, or make the point more relevant. However, there should be no ‘surprises’ and ‘new’ evidence should not be presented at this time as it could result in the Inspector having to adjourn the inquiry so that such evidence can be properly considered and answered. You should have set out your main concerns in your representation sent at the 6 week stage.</p>

<p>17.4. The Inspector will usually ask if you are willing to answer questions about your evidence. You do not have to do this, though it is often helpful to do so and it may add weight to your evidence. Do not feel intimidated. The Inspector will not let anyone ask you hostile or unfair questions. If you oppose the appeal the appellant’s representative may ask you questions. If you support it, the LPA’s representative may ask you questions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Discussion of planning conditions</h2>

<p>18.1. An inquiry will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the proposal is granted planning permission. The fact that conditions are discussed does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>Closing statements</h2>

<p>19.1. Finally (so far as dealing with evidence about the case is concerned) there are closing statements which are an opportunity for the appellant, the LPA and any statutory and Rule 6 parties to sum up their case. They are usually read out from a pre-prepared version which they will give to the Inspector and those other parties who have summed up their case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>20.1. The Inspector will then hear any applications for costs. All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>20.2. There is guidance about costs awards in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance">Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>20.3. It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>20.4. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">21. </span>The close of the inquiry</h2>

<p>21.1. After hearing any applications for costs the Inspector will formally close the inquiry. This is normally followed by the Inspector visiting the appeal site (in certain circumstances that may have occurred during the inquiry). Because the inquiry has been formally closed there can be no further discussion about the appeal during that visit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">22. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>22.1. When made, the decision will be published on GOV.UK and can be viewed using <a class="govuk-link" href="/appeal-planning-inspectorate">the search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">23. </span>Feedback, complaints and challenges</h2>

<p>23.1. We welcome feedback about people’s experience of dealing with us. This can be provided to us at any time. Please send these to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>23.2. If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspector’s decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case it is dealt with by the Customer Quality Team who are independent of the teams who process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. Further information on our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> is available on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>23.3. It should be noted that <strong>the Planning Inspectorate does not have the legal authority to revoke and reconsider an appeal decision after it has been issued</strong> (although we can correct minor typographical and other errors; see Annex P – “What happens if an error has been made” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>. A decision can be reconsidered following a successful challenge in the High Court on a point of law.</p>

<p>23.4. A <strong>challenge against a planning appeal decision must be lodged with the Administrative Court no later than 6 weeks from the decision date</strong>. We would advise anyone considering a challenge to seek legal advice before proceeding. The Administrative Court can also provide further information on the process for different types of casework and the costs involved:</p>

<strong>Within 7 weeks after the start date</strong> Case Management Conference (CMC).
