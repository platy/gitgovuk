<h2>Overview of road length statistics</h2>

<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) publishes estimates of road length in Great Britain on an annual basis. The majority of the data relate to the time point of April in each year. These estimates are designated as National Statistics. The estimates are based on information from a range of sources such as local authorities, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, and National Highways (formerly Highways England).</p>

<p>Road lengths are categorised by road types, incorporating major and minor roads, and also whether the roads are in urban or rural locations. Major roads are also split into trunk roads, which are centrally managed, and principal roads, which are managed by local authorities. A full list of road categories is available in the associated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/road-length-statistics-information/road-lengths-in-great-britain-statistics-notes-and-definitions">notes and definitions</a>. Road lengths are presented for Great Britain as a whole, and are also available by region, country and local authority.</p>

<h2>Data source</h2>

<p>Since 2018, Ordnance Survey’s (<abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr>) Master Map Highways Network dataset has been used in place of <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr>’s Integrated Transport Network (<abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr>). This coincides with the withdrawal of <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr>’s <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr> product and migration to Highways that took place on 31 March 2019. However, the data used from <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> Highways is based on the route hierarchy field which is equivalent to the classification used in <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr> for estimates in previous years. References to ‘Ordnance Survey data’ in the rest of this document relate to this data in Highways (for 2018 onwards) or <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr> (for previous years).</p>

<h2>R199b Consultation</h2>

<p>The department undertook an R199b consultation in 2018 with all local authorities in England. The data from the exercise may be used by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (<abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>) (formerly MHCLG) in calculating future Local Government Finance Settlements and in devising government policy over the funding of local government. The data from the exercise was also used by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to assist with the production of the 2018 Road Lengths in Great Britain statistical release. For the current statistical release, a combination of data from <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> Highways Network, as at April 2021, and data from the 2018 R199b road length consultation was used in deriving road lengths for 2021.</p>

<p>Previously, road length information has been used for funding allocations made by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>. Due to changes to the system of Local Government Funding introduced by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> (then DCLG) in 2013 to 2014 and the stable nature of the statistical series, a consultation did not take place in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The frequency and nature of future consultations will depend on the needs of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>, and the dataset that the department uses to measure road lengths.</p>

<h2>Major roads</h2>

<p>The lengths of major roads (motorways and ‘A’ roads) are obtained from the major roads database maintained by the Department for Transport, using information from Ordnance Survey data, local authorities, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and National Highways (formerly Highways England).</p>

<p>The major roads database contains a series of links, which are unique sections of road which together make up all of the major roads in Great Britain. This database contains various fields of information about these links, including link length. As this database contains links which cover all major roads in Great Britain, the length of major roads can be estimated by summing all of the relevant links to give a total road length for a local authority area, a particular road type, or the whole country.</p>

<p>The road length estimates are fixed at 1 April in the reference year. Only those links in the database which were active/open on this date are included when calculating our estimates for the year. This prevents any links which have been closed over time, or opened since this date, from being included in these estimates.</p>

<h2>Minor roads</h2>

<p>Road length information for minor roads, further classified as ‘B’, ‘C’ and unclassified roads, are typically obtained from Ordnance Survey data, local authorities, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government. Generally, the total minor road length is calculated by summing the full length of roundabouts and single carriageways, and then half the length of slip roads, dual carriageways, traffic island links, traffic island links at junctions and enclosed traffic area links.</p>

<h3>‘B’ roads</h3>

<p>In years where an R199b consultation does not take place, for English local highways authorities ‘B’ road estimates are typically produced taking data from the most recent R199b consultation and multiplying by a growth factor derived from Ordnance Survey data. For Scottish and Welsh authorities, estimates are based directly on Ordnance Survey data.</p>

<p>In years where an R199b consultation takes place, ‘B’ road lengths for each authority in England are initially calculated from Ordnance Survey data. These are then sent to local authorities and may be changed where the local authority can provide evidence that these lengths are incorrect.</p>

<h3>‘C’ and unclassified roads</h3>

<p>In years where an R199b consultation does not take place, the total length of ‘C’ and unclassified roads for each local authority in Great Britain is calculated by summing the ‘minor roads’ and ‘local roads’ categories from the Ordnance Survey data. These categories do not allow ‘C’ and ‘U’ roads to be split out, hence in these years the figures have been combined for ‘C’ and ‘U’ roads.</p>

<p>In years where an R199b consultation takes place, the total length of ‘C’ and unclassified roads for each local authority is calculated by summing the ‘minor roads’ and ‘local roads’ categories in the Ordnance Survey data. These categories do not allow ‘C‘ and ‘U’ roads to be split out. ‘C’ road figures for are taken from the R199b consultation for English authorities and data from the Scottish and Welsh administrations. ‘U’ road figures are then calculated by subtracting these from the total length of ‘minor roads’ and ‘local roads’. The total for ‘C’ and unclassified roads is therefore equal to the total in the Ordnance Survey data.</p>

<h2>Urban and rural breakdown</h2>

<p>Urban areas for England and Wales are defined as built-up areas with a population of at least 10,000, or for Scotland a population of at least 3,000. All other locations are rural areas.</p>

<p>The 2021 road length estimates for Scotland have been calculated using the 2016 Urban and Rural classification (the latest version available). This update was announced in our previous annual publication and provides a more consistent definition of urban and rural roads across Great Britain. Data for years prior to 2021 are still based on the older classification (2013 to 2014 for Scotland).</p>

<p>In 2017, the department improved the methodology used to calculate urban and rural road lengths, so that urban and rural road length estimates are calculated consistently across major and minor roads, and are more precise. Firstly, the urban and rural definition was updated, with the latest 2011 urban polygon data from ONS used to calculate the England and Wales breakdowns, and the 2016 definition from the Scottish Government used. This involved matching the Ordnance Survey data to the urban polygon data (sourced from ONS and Scottish Government) to calculate the precise length of road which falls within and outside of an urban area, with anything outside of an urban area being classified as rural.</p>

<p>Prior to 2017, this approach was only used for minor roads, whereas for major roads (sourced from the Department’s Major Roads Database) each road section would either be assigned as ‘urban’ or ‘rural’ depending on where the majority of its length fell. This resulted in less precise estimates, as a large number of major road sections would span both urban and rural areas.</p>

<h2>Local highway boundary changes</h2>

<p>There have been several changes to local authority (<abbr title="Local authority">LA</abbr>) boundaries since 2018. When a change occurs the existing road length data for all LAs affected are firstly aggregated. The proportion of road length within the new boundaries is then estimated and adjustments are then applied to existing aggregated estimates, to estimate the road length for the LAs within the newly defined boundaries.</p>

<p>There will be a step change in the reported figures for the effected LAs, but it’s important to note that the aggregated data of the LAs affected can still be compared historically as the geographies will be identical at this level. The local authority boundary changes do not impact the regional or national totals as the old and new authorities are still part of the same region.</p>

<p>From April 2019, Poole Unitary Authority (UA), Bournemouth UA and Christchurch District Council (previously part of Dorset County Council) have joined together to form a new Unitary Authority known as Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) UA. Dorset has also ceased to exist as a County Council and formed a new Unitary Authority by combining its remaining district councils - Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset.</p>

<p>From April 2021, the former county of Northamptonshire was separated into two unitary authorities.  West Northamptonshire UA consists of the districts of Daventry, Northampton Borough and South Northamptonshire. North Northamptonshire UA consists of the districts of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough.</p>

<h2>Data and methodological improvements</h2>

<p>A small update to the methodology was announced, in the ‘Road lengths in Great Britain 2017’ statistical release published in July 2018, in how roundabouts are treated for 2018 onwards. This outlined that the full length of the road link for roundabouts are included in the road length formula for the published statistics. This will have a relatively minor impact overall on the road length estimates.</p>

<p>In 2017, there were some small improvements to the methodology used to estimate road lengths, particularly for major roads. These generally meant that the 2017 figure is slightly more accurate than those produced in previous years.</p>

<p>There are step changes in the minor road length figures in 2004 and 2006 due to changes in the base data. In 2004, amendments were made to the data for private roads in Scotland which had been incorrectly recorded as public roads. From 2006, minor road length estimates were made using the Integrated Transport Network (<abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr>) dataset, rather than the OSCAR (Ordnance Survey Centre Alignment of Roads) dataset. This change in methodology led to an increase in minor road lengths due to the greater accuracy of <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr>. While road length estimates used the <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> Mastermap Highways Network product from 2018 onwards, rather than the <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr>, the route hierarchy field in Highways was used which is equivalent to the classification in <abbr title="Integrated Transport Network">ITN</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Future road length statistics publications</h3>

<p>The department is continuing to assess how the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products" rel="external"><abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> MasterMap Highways Network</a> dataset can be used to produce improved estimates of road length in future. The product is continuously being developed with Ordnance Survey, GeoPlace and other stakeholders.
