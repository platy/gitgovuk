<p>Before taking your child for a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine please consider the following questions.</p>

<p>If you answer yes to any of the questions below you may need to give further details to the doctor or nurse at the vaccination centre, who will make a decision on whether it is okay to go ahead with vaccination on the day. Please bring any information with you that may be helpful for the doctor.</p>

<h4>Has your child had a COVID-19 vaccine before?</h4>

<p>For example as part of a trial, or because they are in an at risk group.</p>

<h4>Has your child had an illness with a temperature (fever) in the last week?</h4>

<h4>Has your child had any other vaccines in the last 7 days?</h4>

<h4>Has your child got any long-term medical conditions that require on-going hospital treatment or are they waiting to see a specialist?</h4>

<h4>Has your child had a positive COVID-19 test in the last 12 weeks?</h4>

<p>If your child has had a positive COVID-19 test and is at high risk, you should wait for at least 4 weeks from the date of the positive test and until they are recovered to make their vaccination appointment.</p>

<p>Other children ideally should wait 12 weeks from a positive test.</p>

<h4>Has your child ever had to go to hospital following a severe allergic reaction?</h4>

<p>If so, what was the cause?</p>
