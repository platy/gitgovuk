<p>The Health and Social Care Committee said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We warmly welcome, in principle, NHS England and NHS Improvement’s proposals to promote collaboration. We believe collaboration, rather than competition, as an organising principle, is a better way for the NHS and the wider health and care system to respond to today’s challenges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fact sheet explains how the government plans to remove the Competition and Markets Authority and NHS Improvement (as Monitor’s) formal roles in enforcing competition between NHS providers.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>There is a growing consensus within the NHS that collaboration across NHS organisations is increasingly important to ensure the NHS continues to deliver high quality care and long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>While competition can drive service improvement and should continue to do so where it can add value, the current legislation contains a range of competition rules and powers that can be inflexible, and a barrier to successful integration in the NHS.</p>

<p>For example, the Competition and Markets Authority (<abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>) has specific powers to review mergers involving foundation trusts (<abbr title="foundation trusts">FTs</abbr>). It has become clear that the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> is not the right body to review NHS mergers, and we believe the NHS should be able to make decisions about provider mergers themselves. NHS Improvement also has duties to promote competition in the NHS, and to co-operate with the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>. To reflect NHS Improvement’s merger with NHS England, the new NHS England’s primary role will be to support improvement in the quality of care and use of NHS resources, rather than regulate competition within the NHS.</p>

<p>In addition to this, NHS Improvement uses licence conditions to regulate providers of NHS services. When NHS Improvement propose changes to the licence conditions, the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> has powers to review those changes if a sufficient number of providers object. We think the NHS should be able to make its own decisions on the provider licence.</p>

<h2>What the Bill will do</h2>

<p>The Bill will deliver a number of changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> function to review mergers involving NHS foundation trusts. The <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>’s jurisdiction in relation to transactions involving non-NHS bodies would be unchanged, and the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> will continue to enforce competition in the private healthcare market.  NHS England will review all mergers between NHS Foundation Trusts, to ensure they are in the best interest of their populations. 
 </li>
  <li>remove NHS Improvement’s specific competition functions and its general duty to prevent anti-competitive behaviour to support NHS England’s role as an improvement agency, rather than an economic and competition regulator
 </li>
  <li>
    <p>remove the need for NHS Improvement to refer contested license conditions or to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>introduce new powers for NHS England to provide information and assistance to the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr>, where this is required for the <abbr title="Competition and Markets Authority">CMA</abbr> to carry out their functions</li>
</ul>

<h2>How these provisions will help to reduce bureaucracy</h2>

<p>These changes will enable the NHS to make sensible decisions about provider mergers and changing licence conditions without the involvement of external bodies. They will allow the system to adapt, evolve and integrate, without the need for complex and bureaucratic workarounds.</p>
