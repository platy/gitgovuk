<p>NHS Providers said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The removal of <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> in statute will be one part of a wider move towards a new operating model for the workforce, and serves to formalise the current, positive direction of travel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fact sheet explains the new duty on the Secretary of State to publish a report supporting workforce planning and supply in the NHS as well as the removal of Local Education and Training Boards from statute.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A number of stakeholders, including the Royal College of Nursing, UNISON and some medical Royal Colleges have argued that accountabilities for workforce planning and supply are not currently sufficiently clear. In response, NHS England (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>) recommended that the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) should review this issue as part of any new legislation.</p>

<p>The new duty will require the Secretary of State to publish a report that sets out how workforce planning and supply is organised in England, in order to provide greater transparency and accountability. This report must be published, at a minimum, every 5 years. This duty will complement the concerted non-legislative action and investment on workforce planning and supply already underway.</p>

<p>A flexible approach is needed because the system and how it works together continues to evolve. An example of such a change, which is also in this Bill and covered in this fact sheet, is the abolition of Local Education and Training Boards (<abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr>) to allow the creation of non-statutory Regional People Boards. This will change the way workforce planning is conducted at regional and system level.</p>

<p><abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> were originally established to perform <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>’s functions at local and regional level and had a direct role in commissioning the education and training required at local level, a role which has diminished following the 2017 education funding reforms. LETB functions are also restricted by legislation which has limited their scope to adapt and interact with the regional directorates of NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>) and the newly established non-statutory Regional People Boards (which now provide a consistent architecture across England for oversight of Workforce, education and training).</p>

<p>Removing <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> from statute will reduce duplication of purpose in the system and allow Health Education England (<abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>) to establish a flexible and future-proofed regional workforce operating model based. This work will be based on the experience of collaborative working between <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>, <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr> and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> on the development of the NHS People Plan.</p>

<h2>What the Bill will do</h2>

<p>This Bill will give Secretary of State a duty to publish, at a minimum every 5 years, a report outlining how the workforce planning and supply system for the NHS is organised. There is also a duty for <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> to assist in the preparation of the report, if asked to do so by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>This workforce accountability report will set out the roles of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and its arm’s length bodies, NHS bodies and others and how they work together, in order to provide greater clarity and transparency. The report will cover the whole of the health service in England including primary, secondary, community care and where sections of the workforce are shared between health and social care – for example, registered nurses, doctors and other regulated healthcare professions.</p>

<p>Subject to passage of the Bill through Parliament, we propose to start work on the report in the spring of 2022 and will proactively involve stakeholders in this process.</p>

<p>The role of <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> and their <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> are set out in the Care Act 2014. The Bill will remove <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> from statute with their functions being undertaken by <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr>, to whom the <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> reported.</p>

<h2>How these provisions help to improve accountability</h2>

<p>The report will provide clarity and transparency as to how the workforce planning and supply system operates, by describing the workforce planning and supply roles of relevant national bodies, including <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE/I</abbr>, the newly established Integrated Care Boards (<abbr title="Integrated Care Boards">ICBs</abbr>), Regional People Boards and individual employers - and how they work together in practice at national, regional and local levels. It will not create any new bodies, set out workforce targets or give any bodies new functions, in order to maximise flexibility.</p>

<p>Removal of <abbr title="Local Education and Training Boards">LETBs</abbr> from statute will contribute to the removal of inflexible bureaucratic forms within the NHS and allow <abbr title="Health Education England">HEE</abbr> the freedom it needs to set its own regional operating model that can develop over time.</p>
