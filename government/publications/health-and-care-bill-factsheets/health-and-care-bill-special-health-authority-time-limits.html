<p>This fact sheet explains how the government plans to remove the 3-year time limit on special health authorities.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>All health arm’s length bodies (<abbr title="arm’s length bodies">ALBs</abbr>) carry out important functions necessary for delivering on the Department of Health and Social Care’s objectives.</p>

<p>Special health authorities (<abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr>) are <abbr title="arm’s length bodies">ALBs</abbr> created by the Secretary of State through secondary legislation. They are subject to direction by the Secretary of State in relation to the functions to be carried out, the exercise of those functions and allocation of funding.</p>

<p>Existing legislation sets automatic expiry dates on <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> set up after 2012, which requires their existence to be formally extended every 3 years. This proposal will remove the 3-year time limit on all <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> established by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>It was intended that new <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> would be created to carry out time-limited functions. At the time of the passing of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, some <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> had permanent, ongoing functions, while other <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> were intended to have a limited lifespan or to be converted into non-departmental public bodies (<abbr title="non-departmental public bodies">NDPBs</abbr>).</p>

<p>Since then, the functions of most pre-existing <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> have been added-to or amended, sometimes significantly, and many of the functions of <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> are considered to be enduring.</p>

<h2>What the bill will do</h2>

<p>The Bill will remove the current 3 year automatic expiry date for <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> established after 2012.</p>

<p>There are currently 5 <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS Business Services Authority (<abbr title="NHS Business Services Authority">NHS BSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>NHS Blood and Transplant (NHS B&amp;T)</li>
  <li>NHS Litigation Authority (known operationally as NHS Resolution)</li>
  <li>NHS Counter Fraud Authority (<abbr title="NHS Counter Fraud Authority">NHS CFA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>NHS Trust Development Authority (<abbr title="NHS Trust Development Authority">NHS TDA</abbr>). <abbr title="NHS Trust Development Authority">NHS TDA</abbr> is to be merged into NHS England in this Bill</li>
</ul>

<p>The time limit is unnecessary as the functions of <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> are enduring. It is also inconsistent as the time limits only impact one current SpHA, the NHS Counter Fraud Authority (<abbr title="NHS Counter Fraud Authority">NHS CFA</abbr>).</p>

<p>If further <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> were to be created, they would, currently, also be subject to the time limit legislation which would lead to continued inconsistency of treatment between <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr>. The removal of the automatic expiry dates would remove this inconsistency.</p>

<h2>How these provisions help reduce bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Formally extending a SpHA’s existence every 3 years is time consuming and bureaucratic, and creates unnecessary administration costs for the <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> and the Department.</p>

<p>The removal of the time limit only applies to <abbr title="NHS Counter Fraud Authority">NHS CFA</abbr> as the other <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> were in existence prior to the introduction of a time limit. Therefore, the need to renew <abbr title="NHS Counter Fraud Authority">NHS CFA</abbr> every 3 years is an anomaly.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> will, therefore, be treated equally in legislation and a bureaucratic, time consuming process will be removed.</p>

<p>Another consequence of this policy is that, because the <abbr title="NHS Counter Fraud Authority">NHS CFA</abbr> and any future <abbr title="special health authorities">SpHAs</abbr> will not be subjected to being reviewed and potentially closed every 3 years, staff should be reassured of the stability of their posts.</p>
