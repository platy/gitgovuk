<h2>Background</h2>

<p>1.	Providers will be aware that the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> programme design has been adapted to take into account a number of temporary measures necessitated by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>2. You have received Letters of Change or Contract Variations and will have taken note of the responses which <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> has published in the COVID-19 Provider Question and Answer Log, to be found on Jaggaer.</p>

<p>3. An updated version of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Provider Guidance was recently shared, on Jaggaer, which places all these various measures in the context of each chapter of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Provider Guidance, in specific COVID-19 text boxes.</p>

<p>4. The guidance is being amended, and will once again be shared on Jaggaer, to include information on provider self-referrals. This process is only available to providers who have agreed and fully signed variation CV04.</p>

<h2>Action</h2>

<p>5. Guidance has been updated, at the beginning of “Section 2: Claimant Referrals”, of the COVID-19 <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> provider guidance, to include provider self-referral process flowchart, referral form and instructions.</p>

<p>6. Providers are asked to familiarise themselves with this and ensure the process is followed when making any self-referrals.</p>

<h2>Amendment to provider guidance for provider self-referral</h2>

<p>7. The COVID-19 <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> provider guidance has been temporarily amended as follows, and will be included at the beginning of Section 2: Claimant Referrals in version 2.0 of the COVID-19 <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> provider guidance, which will be shared on Jaggaer.</p>

<h2>Temporary amendment</h2>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>

<p>During COVID-19, Jobcentre Plus resource is being directed towards critical activity aimed at ensuring urgent benefit claims and payments are processed; for a period, Jobcentres will be closed to all but the most urgent transactions.</p>

<p>As a result, Work Coaches may not always be available, therefore, providers, who have signed the CV04 contract variation, are permitted to recruit a limited number of eligible and suitable participants and gain their agreement to attend this voluntary provision. We term this “Provider Self-Referral”.</p>

<p>Provider Self-Referrals are designed to ensure that eligible and suitable individuals who wish to avail themselves of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> support at this time can do so even if Jobcentres do not have the resource to make referrals to the programme.</p>

<p>This flexibility has been introduced at pace and is naturally under scrutiny. For an initial period, providers may refer a limited number of self-referred candidates each month, per <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> contract package area. Please consult your latest Contract Variation for further information.</p>

<p>Self-Referrals will only be accepted from the Prime Provider. Primes must set up internal systems to channel Self-Referrals from your supply chain, via yourself and into <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. You must monitor the quality and number of self-referrals as in-month referrals in excess of the numbers agreed will not be accepted. You will be informed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of the number of referrals you are able to make, by CPA, on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>COVID-19 is a rapidly changing landscape and we will keep this process and referral limit under review.</p>

<h2>Further information and contact details</h2>

<p>8. If you have any queries about the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> programme or this Live Running Memo, please consult your Performance Manager in the first instance.</p>

<p>9. If your enquiry is of a commercial nature, or if you have any queries or concerns regarding Contract Variations or Letters of Change, please direct them to the Commercial Directorate inbox:  <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:employmentcategory.covid19@dwp.gov.uk">employmentcategory.covid19@dwp.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>10. If you have agreed and signed CV04 variation, then please ensure your supply chain is notified of this change and ensure all staff adheres to this updated guidance.</p>
