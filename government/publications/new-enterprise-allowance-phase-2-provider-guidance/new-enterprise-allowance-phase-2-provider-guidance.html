<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>This guidance has been updated to include temporary arrangements that DWP have put in place to allow you to continue to deliver provision during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The majority of the current NEA Provider Guidance, along with any current Live Running Memos, will still apply and is to be used in conjunction with the COVID-19 easements cited in the text boxes, similar to this one, throughout this guidance.</p>

<p>DWP will inform you as to when any easements cease to be in place and the intention is to revert to business as usual processes where possible.</p>
</div>

<h2>Section 1: High level outline of provision and eligibility</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>1.01. New Enterprise Allowance (<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>) Mentoring Phase 2 (which is sometimes referred to as <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> 2017) is aimed at supporting claimants to start their own business and supporting some Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) claimants already self-employed to develop and grow their business.</p>

<p>1.02. For new business starts, <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 will support the creation of a business under any structure as long as the claimant has a genuine aspiration to build a sustainable business that will be based in Great Britain.</p>

<p>1.03. For new business starts, <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 will support the move into self-employment for those people who want to start their own business. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> can provide mentoring support (provider led) and financial assistance in the form of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance, administered by Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>), to claimants who satisfy eligibility and are referred to the scheme by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coaches. Claimants will also have access to the Start-Up Loan schemes, should they need additional start-up financial support.</p>

<p>1.04. This element of the programme, that is new business starts, is being used for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding.  <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding only applies to those contracts that are in England.  It does not apply to Scotland or Wales.</p>

<p>1.05. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants who are already self-employed, <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 will support the development and growth of the business by providing mentoring support to those claimants who satisfy eligibility and are referred to the scheme by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coaches. This includes supporting businesses who have been affected by COVID-19.</p>

<p>1.06. This element of the programme, that is <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed claimants, will not be used for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Match Funding.</p>

<p>1.07. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 is an entirely voluntary scheme which will consist of two customer journeys that are similar in parts, but with a slightly different focus – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-7">annex 7</a> for a Customer Journey Graphic.</p>

<p>1.08. This Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) Provider Guidance supports you, the Prime Provider, in the delivery of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> scheme on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. It forms part of your contract and provides guidance on processes and requirements, contract details and the legal arrangements for delivery.</p>

<h3>High level outline of elements of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> phase 2 for new business starts</h3>

<p>1.12. A brief outline of the elements of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 for new business starts is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a pre-<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 element called Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>), providing claimants with an overview of the impact, commitment and responsibilities of being self-employed. You are required to share the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information with the claimant ahead of any Initial Assessment. This can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these) and must take place before any assessment is undertaken. You will only receive a <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral to the Initial Assessment</li>
  <li>initial assessment – Providers will undertake an initial assessment of eligible individuals within 15 working days of the referral date and record the result in the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral</li>
  <li>an enhanced mentoring offer:
    <ul>
      <li>mentoring support for maximum of 12 weeks and include at least 3 mentoring sessions;</li>
      <li>development of the Business Plan</li>
      <li>the mentoring support will be supplemented with additional workshops covering key areas, for example financial planning and marketing support etc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Business Plan approval – Provider to administer an approval process for Participants’ business plans and provide the participant with feedback. Business Plans must be submitted, assessed and approved or not approved within the 12 weeks mentoring support period described above</li>
  <li>Business Development phase – This is a voluntary phase of up to 13 weeks from the date the business plan has been signed off. During this time, participants will undertake additional work aimed at building a successful platform for their business launch, for example, for market testing and time to apply for a Start-Up Loan. Providers are expected to offer at least one point of contact with a Business Mentor during this period</li>
  <li>post-trading support – The mentoring support from providers will be available for up to 12 months/ 52 weeks from the date trading starts. Providers are to offer a minimum of four mentor meetings (at appropriate intervals) during this period.  Also access to a Peer Network Support</li>
</ul>

<p>Participants will also be eligible to receive an allowance for the first 6 months or 26 weeks that they are trading, subject to meeting qualifying conditions.</p>

<h3>High Level outline of elements of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed</h3>

<p>1.13. A brief outline of the elements of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed claimants is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>initial assessment - Providers to conduct an initial assessment interview with participants, within 15 working days of the referral date and record the result in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral. The Provider will assess the current state of the business and decide if the provision could help the claimant, sifting out those who are not suitable</li>
  <li>mentoring support pre plan approval - Similar to the new business start-up enhanced mentoring offer, the initial mentoring support will last for up to 12 weeks, with a minimum of 3 mentoring sessions over the 12 weeks and will include additional workshops e.g. on financial planning and marketing support as well as developing a Business Development and Growth Plan (<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>) with the participant</li>
  <li>Business Development and Growth Plan (<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>) approval needs to be undertaken (that is, a plan submitted, assessed and approved or not approved), within the 12 week initial mentoring support period</li>
  <li>post <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> Mentoring support will be based around reviewing and further developing the Business Development and Growth Plan, which will include short, medium and long term activities aimed at improving business earnings and therefore, business sustainability. The mentoring support will last for 12 months and Providers will offer four mentoring meetings during this period (at appropriate intervals) and access to a Peer Network Support</li>

<p>1.33. You or your partnership activities can be marketed through media other than Jobcentre Plus services; however, you will need to ensure that the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> eligibility criteria are made clear in any marketing materials.</p>

<p>1.34. Marketing activity must direct interested people to Jobcentre Plus in the first instance, so their eligibility can be confirmed and Jobcentre Plus can track participation and take-up effectively.</p>

<p>1.35. Any marketing or promotional material relating to the delivery of this contract must be sent to and agreed with your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager before it is used.</p>

<p>1.37. Further information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in paragraphs 1.39 to 1.41 of this Section and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a>.</p>

<h3>Other exclusions from scheme</h3>

<p>1.38. For new business starts, because the weekly <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> allowance paid upon the commencement of trading is designed to help the participant build up their business, <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> is not appropriate for a claimant who is taking a job offered by an employer on a self-employed basis.  Note that whilst <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> is appropriate for someone who is starting a Franchise business, it is not appropriate for someone working for Direct Selling companies such as Avon or The Body Shop at Home. (see Annex 9 for definitions of both Franchise and Direct Selling).</p>

<p>1.39. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> can be used to support any legal business that is registered in Britain for tax purposes; however, there are some business areas where you need to take care, especially in the adult leisure or entertainment industry, to ensure that you do not support an illegal business or bring the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> into disrepute. In these cases, you should contact your <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Manager for further advice.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 to 2020 match funding</h3>

<p>1.40. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements only relate to provision in England (and not Scotland or Wales) and not to the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants. Any future reference to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements and the associated actions throughout this guidance should not be taken for provision delivered within CPA11 (Scotland) or <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> 14 (Wales) or for those <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants.</p>

<p>1.41. You must meet <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> specific requirements set by the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) and failure to comply can result in a high financial risk for both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and you, as funds used inappropriately or for ineligible purposes, or where the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements have not been met may be recoverable from you. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>adequate evidence must be kept at all stages for participants who have started on provision</li>
  <li>a complete audit trail of key documents and electronic information must be captured, maintained and retained at all stages throughout the process</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations in connection with marketing and publicising <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> must be met</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements relating to sustainable development, equality, diversity and equal opportunities must be met</li>
  <li>all required documentation for each participant must be made available to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> auditors, investigators, officers or agents if required</li>
  <li>all required documentation for each participant must be available until at least 31st December 2026 (date subject to change or extension) so that an adequate audit trail exists. This is a key audit requirement</li>
</ul>

<p>1.42. The requirements above apply to all participants and services supplied under the Contract. If sub-contractors are used to deliver any part of the services under the contract it is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements are met in respect of all services delivered through such sub-contractors.  The Contractor therefore is ultimately accountable for the compliance of the contract with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements.  Failure to comply with any of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements may result in the reclaim of funding and claims against the Contractor for recovery of any payments received under the Contract and losses arising from the failure to comply with <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements.</p>

<p>1.43. As part of this provision will be funded by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> it may be subject to stringent audit by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> Auditors who will require evidence that the provision is being delivered in accordance with the contract and all payments are clearly and appropriately evidenced. Failure to meet these audit requirements can result in financial penalties or withdrawal of funding.</p>

<p>1.44. You must, keep evidence and key documentation in support of provision delivery and payments. It is your responsibility to ensure that documents and data can be relied on for possible <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit purposes. You must have robust systems in place to ensure that documentation (paper or electronic) is securely held and is easily retrievable and accessible throughout the retention period.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Claimant referrals</h2>

<h3>
<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> new business referrals: Initial Assessment</h3>

<p>2.01. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coaches will refer eligible people to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> by making a referral for an Initial Assessment (<abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>). There will be no requirement for the Work Coach to contact you by telephone whilst making the referral (sometimes referred to as a “warm handover”) but Work Coaches may contact you to discuss the referral where required. Prior to undertaking the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>, you will need to ensure that the Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>) information is shared with the claimant. This can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these).  You must agree this with the claimant as to which is the best option for their circumstances.</p>

<p>Any alternative to a face to face meeting would still need to be interactive and we would not expect, for example, for it to be just a matter of filling in a few questions on a form or answering a few questions on a telephone call.  The face to face option must remain as one of the options available to the customer. As we return to Business as Usual, Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed on re-opening premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>Note: You must not work with a claimant before a referral for the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> is received and if you do, you do so at your own risk.  If you do not have a <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral for a claimant, you must contact Jobcentre plus to ensure it arrives before your claimant intervention.  Where this does not happen you must report this to your Performance Manager.  If you do not receive a referral and the customer arrives for an intervention, then you must not work with the claimant and must direct them back to the Jobcentre Plus Work Coach.</p>

<p>If you start working with a claimant before the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> and the claimant is not accepted on the programme, you will not be able to claim any outcomes or associated fees.</p>

<p>2.02. The referral information sent via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name (including title) and National Insurance number</li>
  <li>address and (where available) a contact telephone number</li>
  <li>if a claimant has informed Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) that they have a health condition (but not what that condition is);</li>
  <li>the claimant attendance arrangements</li>
  <li>activities already undertaken and details of qualifications (where available)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach name, office name &amp; office address</li>
</ul>

<p>2.03. You will be notified via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> when a claimant has informed <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> that they have a health condition or disability, however this will not include what their disability is. Claimants with disabilities may require reasonable adjustments and additional support or arrangements. You should ensure that this information is sought as part of the referral telephone call or Initial assessment (where appropriate).</p>

<p>2.04. Once you receive the claimant information, you will need to contact the claimant. You will need to ensure that you ask the claimant if they are aware of any restrictions, and tailor support accordingly.</p>

<p>Note: While the vast majority of referrals will be made through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, there may be a very small number of referrals made clerically, not through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> e.g. Special Claimant Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>). See <a class="govuk-link" href="#managing-SCR-cases">Managing <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Note:  If you have not received the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> you must query this with <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> and ensure the relevant <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral is received.</p>

<p>2.05. A reminder that whilst there will be no required telephone call/ warm handover prior to the referral being made, as part of business as usual work, the Work Coach should be able to contact you to discuss the referral, if they wish to do so. It is important to maintain those local relationships to ensure this can happen.</p>

<p>2.06. Situations may arise where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> make a referral which is inappropriate. In these cases and only these cases, there are processes to correct the error. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">Annex 1</a> for the action to take.</p>

<p>2.07. Where a claimant decides not to pursue <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> once the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information has been shared, but ahead of any assessment being undertaken, the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> referral will be updated by you using <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.08. It should also be noted that while the vast majority of referrals will be made through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, there may be a very small number of referrals made clerically, not through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> e.g. Special Claimant Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>). See <a class="govuk-link" href="#managing-SCR-cases">Managing <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases</a> for further information.</p>

<p>2.09. If you have not received the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> you must query this with them and ensure the relevant <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral is received before any <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information is discussed or Initial assessment undertaken. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> have been made aware that you may turn the claimant away if this is not the case.</p>

<h3>New business referrals: Initial assessment</h3>

<p>2.10. There is now a single referral to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> and this will be to the Initial Assessment. Before any assessment is undertaken you must have shared the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information with the claimant and had an opportunity to discuss this. This can be part of the same overall conversation but must be done before any assessment takes place.</p>

<p>Note: If you have not received the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> you must query this with <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> and ensure the relevant <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral is received before undertaking the Initial Assessment. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> have been made aware that you will be unable to work with claimants if you have no electronic referral</p>

<p>2.11. A reminder that whilst there will be no required telephone call/ warm handover prior to the referral being made, as part of business as usual work, the Work Coach should be able to contact you to discuss the referral, if they wish to do so. It is important to maintain those local relationships to ensure this can happen.</p>

<p>2.12. The initial assessment must be undertaken within 15 working days of the referral date and the result recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral.</p>

<p>2.13. You must ensure that you retain any documents/evidence to support checks by the European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Performance and Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance and Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>) and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit activity from the point of referral to the initial assessment to when the individual leaves provision.  Providers would need to follow the latest guidance regarding evidence requirements for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>.</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<h4>Health and Safety</h4>

<p>As a result of the increased risk to health and safety as a result of COVID-19 governments in England and Wales have issued guidance around safety. This includes a requirement to complete a health and safety risk assessment that includes the risk from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Please review the government guidance for your country and ensure that a risk assessment is undertaken.</p>

<p>For England, please refer to the guidance around working in Offices, Factories and Labs:</p>

<h4>ESF COVID-19 – audit visits</h4>

<p>If a A125 or A127 audit visit at a Provider or Sub Contractor premises is arranged you will be asked to complete a ‘Host organisation health and safety assurance questionnaire’. This is a Managing Authority document and will be sent to you by the ESF CFO Assurance team. The document must be completed and returned before the audit takes place.</p>

<p>For more information on ESF audit visits, please refer to the Managing Authority Action Note paragraph 4.4 – Health and Safety/Risk Related Action <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07121-reversal-of-covid-19-easements-recommencement-of-visits-to-esf-projects">071/21 Reversal of COVID-19 Easements: Recommencement of Visits to ESF projects</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>When you are not supporting the participant with a face-to-face intervention the documents can be annotated “due to COVID-19” and you should obtain a wet signature as soon as possible. When you are delivering face-to-face interventions a wet signature must be obtained.</p>
</div>

<p>2.14. Situations may arise where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> make a referral which is inappropriate. In these cases, and only these cases, there are processes to correct the error. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">Annex 1</a> for the action to take.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed: Initial assessment</h3>

This group of claimants will not require the Link Up: Start Up information to be shared with them prior to the assessment and are not used as part of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding, so do not produce ESF14/20 Initial or End forms for this participant group.</p>

<p>Note:  If you have not received the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> you must query this with <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> and ensure the relevant <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral is received before the Initial Assessment is undertaken. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> have been made aware that you will be unable to work with the claimant if you have no electronic referral</p>

<p>2.16. There will be no required telephone call/ warm handover prior to the referral being made, as part of business as usual work, the Work Coach should be able to contact you to discuss the referral, if they wish to do so. It is important to maintain those local relationships to ensure this can happen.</p>

<p>2.17. The initial assessment must be undertaken within 15 working days of the referral date and the result recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral.</p>

<p>2.18. Situations may arise where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> make a referral which is inappropriate. In these cases and only these cases, there are processes to correct the error. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">Annex 1</a> for the action to take.</p>

<p>2.19. Certain participants are allocated Special Customer Records (<abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>) status. This is determined by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) Special Section D (<abbr title="Special Section D">SSD</abbr>) in Newcastle for cases where unrestricted access to participant’s data poses a demonstrable risk to the individual’s safety.</p>

<p>2.20. These participants must not have their details held on any electronic systems. Further information regarding managing SCRs is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332517/pg-chapter-2.pdf">Chapter 2 of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>2.21. Further information regarding claiming the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Trading Start Fee and outcomes for <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases is available in Section 8: <a class="govuk-link" href="#scr-cases"><abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases</a>.</p>

<h3>Managing Multi-Agency Public Protection Agreement (<abbr title="Managing Multi-Agency Public Protection Agreement">MAPPA</abbr>) cases</h3>

<p>2.22. <abbr title="Managing Multi-Agency Public Protection Agreement">MAPPA</abbr> are the statutory arrangements for managing sexual and violent offenders. <abbr title="Managing Multi-Agency Public Protection Agreement">MAPPA</abbr> is not a statutory body in itself but is a mechanism through which agencies can better discharge their statutory responsibilities and protect the public in a co-ordinated manner. Further information regarding managing <abbr title="Managing Multi-Agency Public Protection Agreement">MAPPA</abbr> cases is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332517/pg-chapter-2.pdf">Chapter 2 of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Identity checks</h3>

<p>2.23. You must ensure that in all communications with participants you are satisfied that you are engaging with the correct person and verify their identity. This could include asking them to state a combination of their personal information, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li><abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr></li>
  <li>other information, such as details that were included within the original referral from Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>details you hold on your records</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3: Link Up: Start Up (For New Business Starts only)</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>3.01. There will be no specific referral on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> to the Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>). A <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral for an Initial Assessment (<abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>) will be made in all cases.</p>

<p>3.02. You are required to share the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information with the claimant ahead of any <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> appointment. This can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these) and must take place before any assessment is undertaken. The customer should be able to agree with you which is the best option for their circumstance. All elements of the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information should be shared/ delivered and the opportunity to discuss these must be given. Providers are reminded to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>) and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital delivery. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>3.03. As with all aspects of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, participation is voluntary.  The <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> element will be deemed to have taken place when the information has been shared with the claimant and this has been discussed ahead of any assessment (but this can be part of the overall <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> meeting). Only those who have received the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information and have been able to discuss this will be eligible to progress to the mentoring stage of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 (which begins with the initial assessment).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<h4>Health and Safety</h4>

<p>As a result of the increased risk to health and safety as a result of COVID-19 governments in England and Wales have issued guidance around safety. This includes a requirement to complete a health and safety risk assessment that includes the risk from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Please review the government guidance for your country and ensure that a risk assessment is undertaken.</p>

<p>For England, please refer to the guidance around working in Offices, Factories and Labs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>England: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-covid-19">Working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19): guidance from Step 4 - guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Welsh Government has guidance around their current coronavirus restrictions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wales: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/coronavirus" rel="external">Coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Scottish Government guidance regarding transitional arrangements and returning to offices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scotland: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-returning-to-offices/" rel="external">Coronavirus (COVID-19): returning to offices</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>ESF COVID-19 – audit visits</h4>

<p>If a A125 or A127 audit visit at a Provider or Sub Contractor premises is arranged you will be asked to complete a ‘Host organisation health and safety assurance questionnaire’. This is a Managing Authority document and will be sent to you by the ESF CFO Assurance team. The document must be completed and returned before the audit takes place.</p>

<p>For more information on ESF audit visits, please refer to the Managing Authority Action Note paragraph 4.4 – Health and Safety/Risk Related Action <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esf-action-notes-2014-to-2020-programme/07121-reversal-of-covid-19-easements-recommencement-of-visits-to-esf-projects">071/21 Reversal of COVID-19 Easements: Recommencement of Visits to ESF projects</a>.</p>

<p>Evidence should be gathered and retained to show the government guidelines you were adhering to which meant you could not offer face–to-face delivery at the time you supported the participant. This could be due to imposed lockdown restrictions, or the COVID-19 secure guidance required under health and safety legislation.</p>

<p>When you are not supporting the participant with a face-to-face intervention the documents can be annotated “due to COVID-19” and you should obtain a wet signature as soon as possible. When you are delivering face-to-face interventions a wet signature must be obtained.</p>
</div>

<p>3.04. The <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> will ensure, as far as possible, that only those participants with a viable business idea and who have the potential to both progress to trading and remain in sustainable self-employment long term, go on to actually start on provision. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the pros and cons of self-employment.</p>

<p>3.05. However delivered, the Link Up: Start Up must still be effective and give the individual the required overview that we have stipulated in the contract and this provider guidance.</p>

<p>3.06. You will still need to meet the requirement of obtaining evidence to show this has taken place.  Where the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> has taken place face to face, you need to obtain a physical signature on whatever document you use for this part of the process to show this has taken place. It is up to you how you decide to collect this but a physically signed document must be available if requested for face to face meetings.</p>

<p>3.07. For the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> element it will be enough to share this information with the claimant ahead of the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>, so that it can be discussed at that meeting, before any assessment is undertaken. All elements of the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information should be shared/delivered. There is no requirement to have this as a separate conversation ahead of the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>. You will need to ensure you keep evidence of having issued the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information, for example, a copy of an email sent containing the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information or a signature if taking place in a face to face environment. You are reminded to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital delivery.</p>

<h3>Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>) Content</h3>

<p>3.08. All attendees should leave the workshop with enough information to enable them to decide if self-employment and <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> programme is appropriate for them. Areas covered in the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information shared should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overview of what being self-employed means and the levels of commitment required to set-up and sustain a business</li>
  <li>outline to participants clearly the advantages (for example, being your own boss, deciding what hours you work, and how you carry out that work) and disadvantages of self-employment (for example, potentially long working hours, lack of paid holiday or sick leave, and potentially erratic income)</li>
  <li>a clear outline of the wider implications of self-employment, for example, the lack of paid annual leave, tax implications of being self-employed</li>
  <li>the implications self-employment will have on any benefits participants receive, including Working Tax credits.  For those on <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> this will include the expectation of earnings from the business reaching the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> within the 12 month start-up period. Participants will also need to understand the impact of the <abbr title="Minimum Income Floor">MIF</abbr> on their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> award</li>
  <li>how does being self-employed differ from being employed?</li>
  <li>other legal or technical implications, such as health and safety regulations, insurance costs, or licencing</li>
  <li>an overview of accounting or bookkeeping</li>
  <li>what happens when self-employed people have sickness or maternity or paternity absences?</li>
  <li>what skills are needed to be successfully self-employed?</li>
  <li>do they need start-up finance? What is available re Start Up Loans for the new business, including does the participant know their credit rating (or how to obtain one) and how this impacts on being able to qualify for a loan?</li>
  <li>Q&amp;A session/opportunity to discuss <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information</li>
</ul>

<p>Before any assessment takes place, the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> should be discussed to allow the participant the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns from the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information received. This can be undertaken as part of the overall <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> meeting or before the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> meeting.</p>

<p>You will update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> with the outcome of the overall <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> (either Attended/Did Not Attend/Did Not Start) and this will include cases where individuals, having received the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information and discussed this with you, decide not to proceed (record such cases as “Did Not Start”).</p>

<p>Evidence should be retained to show that the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information was shared with the claimant, for example, a copy of an email sent containing the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information.</p>

<p>You are reminded to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital delivery.</p>

<p>3.09. Paragraph 3.08 sets out our minimum requirement and is not an exhaustive list.  When developing and delivering the Link Up: Start Up you will add your considerable detailed business knowledge and knowledge of the local economy to the content of the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Post attendance</h3>

<p>3.10. Where a customer requires more time to consider the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information, and this fell outside of the requirement to undertake the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> within 15 working days of referral, then you would update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and a new referral would be made, at a later date, if required. Any subsequent referral would require the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information to be issued again.</p>

<h3>Use of <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo</h3>

<p>3.11. Although the Link Up: Start Up element is not part of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Match Funding, it is part of the overall process and in particular it advertises the provision to potential participants.</p>

<p>3.12. Therefore <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> publicity rules apply to this part of the process and you must comply with ESF14/20 marketing and publicity requirements. As with all <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements, this does not apply to provision delivered in Scotland or Wales.</p>

<p>3.13. Full information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a>.</p>

</div>

<h2>Section 4: Initial assessment referral or activity; feedback or complaints procedure; additional support and conditionality</h2>

<h3>New business initial assessment meeting and suitability or self-employed prospects</h3>

<p>4.01. There is only a single referral made to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>. This will be to the Initial Assessment (<abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr>) and the Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>) information must be shared with the claimant, and discussed, ahead of any assessment taking place.</p>

<p>4.02. All referrals will be via Jobcentre Plus and you will receive confirmation via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. You must have a <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral before you work with a claimant. Whilst a telephone conversation with the Work Coach is no longer a requirement (this was referred to as the warm handover), the Work Coach should still be able to contact you to discuss a referral, if required.</p>

<p>4.03. Initial Assessments need to take place within 15 working days of the referral and be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral. If a participant contacts you to re-book an initial assessment appointment, this can be agreed as long as the 15 working day timescale is met. However, you must engage with the Work Coach to ensure they are aware that the appointment day/time is being changed.  If the 15 working day timescale will not be met, you must take action as per paragraph 4.04, to refer back to the Work Coach, and recording this as a “Did not attend interview” on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.04. The following outcomes from the initial assessment must be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start (claimant agreed to start scheme)</li>
  <li>Did not start (claimant attended initial assessment but it was decided that the claimant would not take up the offer of support or scheme or business proposition does not have a reasonable chance of success)
*Note: This reason is also recorded where, following the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>, the claimant decides not to continue before any assessment is undertaken</li>
  <li>Did not attend interview</li>
  <li>Cancel - No Contact (used for ineligible referrals, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">Annex 1</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>4.05. The initial assessment meeting can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these) and should cover an assessment of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the claimant’s business proposition, and whether their business idea has a reasonable chance of success</li>
  <li>whether the claimant is likely to be able to produce a robust  Business Plan, and this plan can be assessed and approved or not approved, within 12 weeks</li>
  <li>whether the claimant has a reasonable chance of launching a business, sustaining the business and succeeding in self-employment (this should also include consideration of the need to raise finance or use of a start-up loan and signposting the participant to seeking to understand what their credit worthiness, for example, by undertaking a credit check)</li>
  <li>assessment of business resilience (including personal resilience) and upskilling/ business adaptability</li>
  <li>the claimant’s  overall suitability for the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: In cases where a joint business idea is proposed you should also consider whether the business proposition can sustain the participants.</p>

<p>4.06. You are reminded to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital delivery. As we return to Business as Usual, Providers will need to ensure they follow the latest government guidance and also consider completing a risk assessment on re-opening premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>4.07. You must keep a written log of the initial assessment with claimants, including evidence from claimants that the initial assessment has taken place.  You must retain this evidence to support checks by the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Performance and Compliance Officers (<abbr title="Performance and Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>) and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit activity. Where face to face delivery is undertaken, a signature from the claimant, to confirm the required activity has taken place, must be included as part of any evidence.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>With regards to obtaining a signature, wherever there is a need to obtain a “wet” signature on a document then the document can be annotated “due to Covid-19” in lieu of a signature. A signature must be sought, where possible, by you at the next appropriate opportunity. Documentation still needs to be retained by you.</p>
</div>

<p>4.08. It is an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirement that all participants are informed about the support they are getting from <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> at their initial interview.  The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2020 leaflet should be issued to everyone who attends and, for all who start <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 provision, that <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> documentation is completed. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2020 leaflet outlines this. Further details including how to order the leaflets can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>COVID-19</h4>

<p>The ESF 2014-2020 guidance has been updated with regards to COVID-19. Please refer to the ESF Guidance to identify any changes to ESF requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>4.09. As part of the initial assessment meeting you will need to obtain a declaration from the participant that they understand that the provision is funded by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and that their information will be stored and used to register them for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> evaluation.</p>

<p>4.10. You will also need to obtain confirmation from the participant that they have received the ESF2020 leaflet as part of the initial assessment meeting.</p>

<p>4.11. An electronic ESF1420 form must be fully completed for each participant who takes part in your provision. The information captured will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participant details:
    <ul>
      <li>name, <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr>, date of birth, address, telephone number, email address</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>participant characteristics:

      <li>gender, labour market situation, for example, inactive or unemployed, basic skills, education level, household status (jobless household, jobless household with dependant children, single parent with dependant children),  ethnicity, disability, ex-offender, homeless</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the postcode of the venue where the  initial assessment meeting is being conducted and the Action Plan agreed</li>
  <li>a declaration from the participant that they understand that the provision is funded by <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and that their information will be stored and used to register them for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> and future <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> evaluation</li>
  <li>Confirmation from the participant that they have received the ESF2020 leaflet</li>
  <li>endorsement (signature) from the participant that the data provided is correct</li>
  <li>endorsement (signature) from you that the information supplied is correct to your knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>4.12. You must send the completed form to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within 10 working days of the participant signing it.  Contact details for where the form needs to be sent will be included on the form. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-13">Annex 13</a> for further details regarding the ESF1420 form and instructions for completing or submitting the form.</p>

<p>4.13. Where the initial meeting is not being conducted face-to-face, and there is a requirement to have signed documents from the claimant, for example, the written log of the initial assessment, or ESF1420 form.</p>

<p>Therefore, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>during the initial meeting go through the forms required and complete all relevant sections to the point where a signature is required</li>
  <li>note the records you have set up for the claimant to show that the form has been completed using X method, for example by telephone, because a face-to-face meeting was  impossible for Y reason</li>
  <li>send the form by post to the claimant, with a reply paid envelope and instruction to check, sign the form or forms as necessary, and return within 5 days</li>
  <li>follow this up until the signed form (or forms) is returned at which point you will sign and date and will then follow normal processes required for that particular form</li>
</ul>

<p>4.14. A reminder that you must adhere to <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements on document retention. You must, keep evidence and key documentation in support of Provision delivery and payments. It is your responsibility to ensure that documents and data can be relied on for possible <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit purposes. You must have robust systems in place to ensure that documentation (paper or electronic) is securely held and is easily retrievable and accessible throughout the retention period. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>With regards to the ESF requirements set out in paragraphs 4.08 to 4.14, please note that the ESF 2014-2020 guidance has been updated with regards to Covid-19. Please refer to the ESF Guidance to identify any changes to ESF requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>4.15. Where a claimant is to be referred to a sub-contractor (for example, for business mentoring) following the initial assessment, or the initial assessment is conducted by a sub-contractor, you need to ensure the claimant is informed that information will be shared between yourself and the sub-contractor in relation to the claimant’s participation in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.16. The outcome of all initial assessments (for example, Reason for ‘Did not start’) should also be notified to the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach via the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form (NEA1 or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants ‘UCNEA1 form: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>) for all cases within 2 working days from the outcome of the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> being established and evidenced.</p>

<p>4.17. For those whose businesses could be successfully supported by the provision, the 12 week Mentoring Phase begins on the date of this Initial Assessment. This will become the Start Date.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed: initial assessment and suitability/business growth prospects</h3>

<p>4.18. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will refer eligible <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed claimants to an Initial Assessment.</p>

<p>4.19. All referrals will be via Jobcentre Plus and you will receive confirmation via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. You must have a <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> referral before you work with a claimant. Whilst a telephone conversation with the Work Coach is no longer a requirement (this was sometimes referred to as a “warm handover”), the Work Coach may still contact you to discuss a referral, if required.</p>

<p>4.20. This group of claimants are not used as part of the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding.</p>

<p>4.21. The following principles will apply to this process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must conduct an initial assessment with the claimant to test their suitability for the scheme within 15 working days of the referral date and record the outcome via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> within 20 working days of the referral date</li>
  <li>
    <p>the following outcomes from the initial referral must be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start (claimant agreed to start scheme)</li>
      <li>Did not start (claimant attended initial assessment but it was decided that the claimant would not to take up the offer of support)</li>
      <li>Did not attend interview</li>
      <li>Cancel - No Contact (used for ineligible referrals, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">Annex 1</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4.22. You will undertake an Initial Assessment of all eligible individuals. This can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these). You must agree this with the claimant as to which is the best option for their circumstances. Any alternative to a face to face meeting would still need to be interactive and we would not expect, for example, for it to be just a matter of filling in a few questions on a form or answering a few questions on a telephone call. The face to face option must remain as one of the options available to the customer. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support. As a minimum this will include an assessment of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the individual’s business including their financial position and marketing activities</li>
  <li>business resilience (including personal resilience) and upskilling/ business adaptability</li>
  <li>that self-employment is their main source of earnings and that the business is carried out with the expectation of profit</li>
  <li>the future potential of the business in the current market</li>
  <li>whether the support offered by the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 will help them improve their earnings from the business</li>
  <li>whether the claimant is likely to be able to produce a robust Business Development and Growth Plan, and have this plan assessed and approved or not approved, within 12 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>4.23. You must keep a written log of the initial assessment with claimants, including evidence from claimants that the initial assessment has taken place. This can include, but not limited to, email confirmation, signatures (where face to face activity occurs) and electronic signatures.</p>

<p>Note: An electronic signature is data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign. This can be as simple as a name entered on an electronic document, but it should be reasonable to assume, from the information retained, that this person in question is linked to the signature/ evidence retained. The requirement remains to have evidence that shows that a particular individual has undertaken the Initial Assessment, regardless of how that Initial Assessment is delivered.</p>

<p>4.24. Where a claimant is to be referred to a sub-contractor (for example, for business mentoring) following the initial assessment or the initial assessment is conducted by a sub-contractor, you need to ensure the claimant is informed that information will be shared between yourself and the sub-contractor in relation to the claimant’s participation in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.25. You should only accept people on to the programme who will benefit from the support of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2, where the business has potential to grow, become more efficient and more profitable.</p>

<p>4.26. The outcome of all initial assessments (for example, Reason for ‘Did not start’) should also be notified to the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach via the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form (in this case the UCNEA1 SCOTWALES form, regardless of where the provision is being delivered from: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>) within 2 working days from the outcome of the <abbr title="Initial Assessment">IA</abbr> being established and evidenced.</p>

<p>Note: The reason the SCOTWALES version of the UCNEA1 form is used for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants, regardless of where the provision is delivered, is that this version of the form does not include an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo.</p>

<p>4.27. For those whose businesses could be successfully supported by the provision, the 12 week Mentoring Phase begins on the date of this initial assessment.  This will become the start date.</p>

<h3>Re-referring new start-up claimants/<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed who fail to attend the Initial Assessment</h3>

<p>4.28. Where a claimant has failed to attend their initial assessment meeting, <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will be notified via the action the provider takes in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> (recording the failure to attend (<abbr title="Failure to Attend">FTA</abbr>) or failure to start, which will close the referral).</p>

<p>4.29. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will then establish the reasons why the claimant may have failed to attend or start and will establish if <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> remains appropriate.  Where there have been multiple referrals and non-attendance <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will question the claimant’s commitment before making a re-referral.  Where someone has not attended on a number of occasions, for example 3 times or more, you can, if you wish, query the referral with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> referring officer but you cannot refuse the referral if <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> decide it is appropriate.</p>

<p>4.30. Where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> establish that <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> remains appropriate for a claimant they will make a new referral, following the same process in which the original referral was made (booking a further initial assessment meeting and making a new electronic referral through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>).</p>

<h3>Communicating your feedback and complaints procedure</h3>

<p>4.31. You must ensure that you fully explain your comments and complaints procedure to each participant as part of the initial assessment process. For further information regarding Complaint Resolution please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/871436/generic-guidance-chapter-2.pdf" rel="external">Chapter 2 of Generic Provider Guidance</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/850293/Complaint_resolution_core_briefing_pack_DWP_provider_guidance.pdf.pdf" rel="external">Core briefing pack for provider’s complaints resolution</a>.</p>

<p>4.32. You must have an appropriate complaints process across the whole supply chain to attempt to resolve participant’s complaints. Where a participant is unhappy about the service they receive from you and raises a complaint you should ensure that you follow each step of your detailed process robustly in order to bring the complaint to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>4.33. After following all steps in your process you must include in your final response to the participant a standard text which signposts the customer to contact the Independent Case Examiner (<abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>) should they wish to pursue their complaint. The text can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-8">annex 8</a> of this provider guidance.</p>

<p>4.34. <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will mediate between you and the participant to broker a resolution. If a resolution cannot be agreed between either party, <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> will undertake a full investigation of the complaint.</p>

<p>4.35. If the complaint is upheld at this stage, in part or in full, then the prime contractor will be charged a fee of £5,000 and will also be liable for any financial redress recommended by <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr>.</p>

<p>4.36. In the event that the complaint against the prime contractor or sub-contractor is dismissed, no fee shall be payable.</p>

<p>4.37. Any fees in respect of complaints that have been upheld against the prime contractor or the sub-contractor and any financial redress due to the claimant shall be paid within 4 weeks of the date of the <abbr title="Independent Case Examiner">ICE</abbr> final investigation report.</p>

<p>4.38. Further information regarding complaint resolution can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/850293/Complaint_resolution_core_briefing_pack_DWP_provider_guidance.pdf.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Providers complaint resolution core briefing pack</a>.</p>

<h3>Identifying additional support requirements</h3>

<h4>Travel expenses</h4>

<p>4.39. Local delivery is deemed to be essential to the successful delivery of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.  As a result you are not expected to provide travel expenses for participants. Participants experiencing issues with travel costs for participation in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> need to discuss these with their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach.</p>

<p>4.40. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed claimants will not be eligible to claim travel expenses.</p>

<h4>Funding childcare costs</h4>

<p>4.41. Childcare costs are not the responsibility of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Provider, however in exceptional circumstances may be covered by a discretionary payment from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>. In such cases you should refer the participant back to their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach.</p>

<p>4.42. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> (full service) existing self-employed claimants will not be eligible to claim childcare expenses.</p>

<h4>Access to Work support</h4>

<p>4.43. Access to Work support is not available until trading commences.  It is your responsibility to provide any support required during the pre-trading mentoring phase. Participants will be able to apply for Access to Work support either once they have ended their claim to benefit or reported a change of circumstances to register a trading start (if they are claiming <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>) or they are about to do so. An application can be made if they are about to start trading as self-employed but any support will not commence until they actually start trading.  Further information regarding <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a>, including full eligibility conditions and how to apply.</p>

<h4>Start-up funding or loans</h4>

<p>4.44. Participants considering the use of start-up funding or loan as part of their plan for their business should be signposted to the Start Up Loans scheme.  Although there are many Start Up Loans Delivery Partners available nationwide, it is essential that <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participants are signposted to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.startuploans.co.uk/apply/" rel="external">Start Up Loan Company (<abbr title="Start Up Loan Company">SULCO</abbr>)</a>. They should remember to tick the box that indicates they are, or have been, on the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> programme. The participant will then be contacted within 48 hours by one of <abbr title="Start Up Loan Company">SULCO</abbr>’s Delivery Partners to provide support with the loan application process.</p>

<p>4.45. If any <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participants require any additional information about the application process, please ask them to contact the Start Up Loans Company’s Customer Services Team by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Hello@startuploans.co.uk">Hello@startuploans.co.uk</a> or via phone on 0344 264 2600 between the hours of 9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays).</p>

<p>4.46. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participants will have different needs, and a Start Up Loan may not be the most appropriate source of finance for them or their business.  When they receive an application for a loan, the Start Up Loans Company will assess the participant’s finance needs and their suitability for funding.  If a Start Up Loan is not the most appropriate option, the Start Up Loan Company may signpost participants to other sources of funding.</p>

<p>4.47. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Providers (or your supply chain, including mentors) should not make any judgement about the suitability of the client for funding, or assess the availability of other sources of funding. This is a regulated activity and is deemed to be credit brokering.  This assessment will be undertaken by the Start Up Loans Company.  By signposting clients to the Start Up Loans Company, <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Providers are not deemed to be acting as credit brokers and are not carrying out any activities that require licensing (or exemption) by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<h3>Conditionality while participating on <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>: new business start only</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>4.48. Conditionality will only apply to the new business start-up participants of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2.</p>

<p>4.49. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 participation is voluntary for all eligible groups, and participants can leave the scheme at any time without threat of a benefit sanction.  However, those participants claiming <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> must inform their Work Coach within 2 working days of their decision to leave the scheme otherwise they may incur a sanction.</p>

<p>4.50. Where you become aware that the participant has left the scheme you should notify the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach via the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form (NEA1 or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants ‘UCNEA1 form: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>).  You should also complete the ESF1420 end form and send it to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> admin team: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-13">Annex 13</a> for more details.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>COVID-19</h4>

<p>The ESF 2014-2020 guidance has been updated with regards to COVID-19. Please refer to the ESF Guidance to identify any changes to ESF requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>4.51. All business start-up participants in the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 are expected to engage fully in the scheme and complete the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 mentoring phase within a maximum of 12 weeks of the start date.  This includes having the Business Plan approved or not approved by you.</p>

<p>4.52. This 12 week period should not be extended further (unless, in very exceptional circumstances, you have agreement from the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, or any other appropriate member of <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> staff, which you should record any such agreement including the name of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> member of staff with whom you agreed this with).</p>

<p>Note: It will be very rare for a reason for an extension to be agreed and you should engage with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach at the earliest opportunity where you consider that the 12 week timescale will not be met.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> claimants</h4>

<p>4.53. These participants remain subject to the conditionality associated with their benefit receipt.  For <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> participants the condition to be ‘actively seeking paid employment’ is replaced by a requirement to participate fully in the mentoring phase of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2.</p>

<p>This will mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attending all appointments with mentor or mentoring provider organisation (or their representative) where given at least 24 hours’ notice of the appointment</li>
  <li>doing things each week to develop the business proposal</li>
</ul>

<p>Telling Jobcentre Plus within 2 working days if the business idea is no longer being pursued, or the mentoring relationship ends.</p>

<p>4.54. Whilst in the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Mentoring Pre Start-up Period, participants will remain on <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> and therefore will be required to attend the Jobcentre for jobsearch reviews (generally fortnightly) and confirm they are continuing to meet agreed conditionality requirements. Wherever possible <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will arrange a suitable time to ensure that this or any other required attendance does not impact negatively on the claimant’s attendance with a mentor or adviser.</p>

<p>4.55. Within 5 working days of a claimant starting <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach must conduct an interview with <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> participant to agree conditionality during the 12 weeks pre start-up period.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants</h4>

<p>4.56. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed are determined to be gainfully self-employed for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes will not be subject to conditionality requirements.</p>

<p>4.57. <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Claimants on <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> do not have to perform work search during the mentoring period, but will have to follow any work preparation requirements which could include, for example, attending mentoring meeting. Review meetings take place to ensure that they are attending all the meetings required with their mentor. This revised conditionality can last no longer than 12 weeks after the first meeting with the mentor.</p>

<h4>Other benefit claimants</h4>

<p>4.58. Participants in receipt of other benefits, such as <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> or the <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, remain subject to their usual benefit conditionality whilst they are participating in the mentoring phase of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2.</p>

<p>4.59. However, they are expected to complete the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> phase within the same 12 weeks as <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> claimants. This should not be extended beyond 12 weeks (unless, in very exceptional circumstances, you have agreement from the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, or any other appropriate member of <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> staff, which you should record any such agreement including the name of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> member of staff with whom you agreed this with).</p>

<p>Note: It will be very rare for a reason for an extension to be agreed and you should engage with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach at the earliest opportunity where you consider that the 12 week timescale will not be met.</p>

<h2>Section 5: Mentoring</h2>

<h3>Business mentor relationship: General</h3>

<p>5.01. Following the initial assessment meeting and agreement by the participant to start on the scheme, you should immediately start working with the participant to support them in developing a Business Plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>. We expect you to be able to undertake some business planning activities prior to matching the participant with a Business Mentor.</p>

<p>5.02. The Business Mentor should work with participants while they are preparing to become self-employed (the pre Start-up Period) or working on their Business growth and Development Plan (<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>).</p>

<p>5.03. You may also use a range of mentoring support and business advice through the duration of the participant’s time on the scheme, for example, through the use of group sessions, sharing of information and workshops. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>5.04. You should match each participant with a Business Mentor, within 10 working days of the initial assessment.</p>

<p>5.05. Where a participant is to be referred to a sub-contractor (for example, for business mentoring) following the initial assessment you need to ensure the participant is informed that information will be shared between yourself and the sub-contractor or Business Mentor in relation to the individual’s participation in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.06 . You should ensure there are sufficient Business Mentors to work with <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>5.07. Business Mentors must have business experience and the appropriate skills (and relevant accreditation where necessary) needed to support participants to prepare for self-employment or develop existing business and develop a viable Business Plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> that demonstrates the business’s sustainability potential. They will be expected to understand the local business landscape and be candid with participants, but at the same time have the ability to listen and empathise.</p>

<p>5.08. During the participant’s time on <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> you must ensure that the Business Mentor is providing appropriate mentoring and business advice, including making an initial assessment of the participant’s needs, helping them to prepare a Business Plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> during initial 12 week mentoring period and provide access to ongoing support during the 52 week trading period or business development period. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">Section 9</a> for further details of evidencing requirements.</p>

<p>5.09. Business Mentors will also be expected to look to signpost participants to other local partners as a source of business support and funding.</p>

<h3>Business Plans or BDGPs</h3>

<p>5.10. The content of Business Plans or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> will differ between individuals; however, each Business Plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> must include sufficient information to demonstrate the viability of the business or business idea.  Each plan must include the following as a minimum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a summary of the individual and the business or business idea including both the participant and the business name, address or addresses and contact details, including website details if applicable, and the expected date of the business launch or length of time trading</li>

      <li>where appropriate, identification of the limiting factors that have not allowed the business to develop and grow</li>
      <li>a description of the participant’s short, medium and longer term vision for the business</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal information about the participant including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>where appropriate, why they are interested in self-employment</li>

      <li>the knowledge of the industry or sector</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

      <li>overheads such as insurance, rent, business rates, stock or equipment costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>personal budget plan: how will you manage financially whilst your business develops?  What will your income be?  How will you make loan repayments?  This will help individuals ensure they can manage financially on what might be a low income when they first start trading</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre start-up period or business planning: New business starts</h3>

<p>5.11. During the pre start-up period there must be at least three mentor meetings (in addition to the Initial Assessment). Mentoring meetings may be conducted face to face, via telephone or digital channels as appropriate. You must agree this with the claimant as to which is the best option for their circumstances.  Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>5.12. You are reminded to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital delivery. Please follow instructions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527577/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Chapter 8 of Generic guidance for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> providers</a> to raise a request if approval is needed.</p>

<p>5.13. You must keep a written log of each meeting and contact that takes place with participants, including with Business Mentors.</p>

<p>5.14. You must obtain signed confirmation from participants for each face-to-face meeting that takes place. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">Section 9</a> for further details of evidencing requirements.</p>

<p>5.15 . During the pre start-up period you must provide guidance and mentoring to support the participant in preparing for self-employment and developing their business plan.</p>

<p>5.16. To supplement this mentoring support you will deliver additional seminars focused on particular aspects of self-employment. The seminars are to supplement, not replace, the mentoring support delivered. Like the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>, the seminar information must be shared with the claimant face to face, via telephone or digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these) as appropriate. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding to offer face to face support. You are reminded to comply with <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security requirements when engaging in any digital activity. There must be the opportunity for the participant to discuss the information with you, for example during one of the mentor meetings.</p>

<p>5.17. As a minimum these seminars need to cover:</p>

<p>Financial planning, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overview of business accounts, invoicing</li>
  <li>forecasting of incomings, outgoings, overheads</li>
  <li>personal income</li>
  <li>start-up funding or loans: including signposting to undertaking a credit check (and understanding what their credit worthiness is) and managing repayments</li>
</ul>

<p>Marketing, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing an online presence including social media</li>
  <li>use of local media</li>
  <li>advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>5.18. You must offer ALL participants this seminar information/ a place on these seminars. You will need to ensure you keep evidence of having issued the Financial Planning and Marketing Workshop information, for example, a copy of an email sent containing the information. The claimant should be able to discuss this information with you in relation to their business.</p>

<p>5.19. Only in exceptional circumstances should participants be allowed to opt-out and not be issued with the information, for example, an accountant need not take part in a financial planning seminar.  It is for you to determine if you consider the circumstance to be exceptional based on your knowledge of the participant and the associated business.</p>

<p>5.20. You need to record the issuing of the seminar information and be able to evidence that this was undertaken and the claimant was able to discuss this with you or where you determine the use of. However, if anyone does opt out, and request the information is not issued to them (or you deem it not required e.g. an accountant not needing the financial planning workshop), then you should still record this.</p>

<p>5.21 . All participants must complete the mentoring phase and submit their business plan in enough time for any assessment and subsequent re-work, if applicable, to be completed in 12 weeks from the Start Date (i.e. the date of initial assessment).  This 12 week period should not to be extended further (unless, in very exceptional circumstances, you have agreement from the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, or any other appropriate member of <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> staff, which you should record any such agreement including the name of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> member of staff with whom you agreed this with).</p>

<p>Note: It will be very rare for a reason for an extension to be agreed and you should engage with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach at the earliest opportunity where you consider that the 12 week timescale will not be met.</p>

<p>5.22. At the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> 12 week conditionality / review meeting, the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will review the participant’s progress. In advance of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> review at the end of week 12, you should send the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form, NEA1 or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants UCNEA1, to the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach providing details on progress. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a> for details of the form.</p>

<p>Note: At the end of the 12 week pre start-up period a <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> participant will resume normal conditionality and will be expected to resume normal job seeking activity.  For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants, if they move onto the business development phase, conditionality remains the same as during the mentoring phase. See paragraphs 5.45 to 5.47 for more information regarding the business development phase.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed: Mentoring</h3>

<p>5.23. For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants, the purpose of the mentoring support is to support the development and growth of the business, by developing a Business Development and Growth Plan (<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>).</p>

<p>5.24. The <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> will consist of a range of activities specifically tailored to each business and include short, medium and longer term goals.  These activities will include, but not exclusively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing a marketing plan</li>
  <li>using social media</li>
  <li>mapping the competition: what sets this business apart?</li>
  <li>market research</li>
  <li>use of local media</li>
  <li>advertising</li>
  <li>developing their customer base</li>
  <li>keeping accurate accounting records</li>
  <li>reinvesting in the business</li>
  <li>personal budgeting plans</li>
  <li>ways to reduce overheads or business expenses</li>
  <li>developing links to other businesses in the area</li>
</ul>

<p>5.25. The <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> must also include short, medium and long term goals for increasing earnings from the business.  These should cover 6 month, 12 month and beyond 12 month timescales.</p>

<p>5.26. You may use a range of mentoring support and business advice through the participant’s time on the scheme to support this.</p>

<p>5.27. There must be at least 3 one-to-one meetings (in addition to the initial assessment for self-employed participants) between mentor and the participant. These should be documented.</p>

<p>5.28. As this group of participants will already be actively working in their businesses, these mentor meetings may be conducted via other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approved secure methods (for example, telephone or via secure virtual media).  Please follow instructions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527577/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Chapter 8 of Generic guidance for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> providers</a> to raise a request if approval is needed.</p>

<p>5.29. Mentoring sessions can be conducted face to face, via telephone or digital channels as appropriate. You must agree this with the claimant as to which is the best option for their circumstances.  Any alternative to a face to face meeting would still need to be interactive. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support.</p>

<p>5.30. Given that this group of participants will already be trading, mentoring sessions can take place outside routine office hours, again only with the agreement of the participant.</p>

<p>5.31. To supplement this mentoring support you will deliver additional seminars focused on particular aspects of self-employment. Like the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr>, the seminar information must be shared with the claimant face to face, via telephone or digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these) as appropriate. There should be the opportunity for the participant to discuss the information with you, for example during a mentor meeting. Any alternative to a face to face meeting would still need to be interactive. Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed when deciding whether to re-open premises and offering face-to-face support</p>

<p>5.32. As a minimum these seminars need to cover:</p>

<p>Financial planning, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overview of business accounts, invoicing</li>
  <li>forecasting of incomings, outgoings, overheads</li>
  <li>personal income</li>
  <li>start-up funding or loans and managing repayments</li>
</ul>

<p>Marketing, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing an online presence including social media</li>
  <li>use of local media</li>
  <li>advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>5.33. All existing self-employed participants must be offered access to the additional seminars. The outcome of this offer should be recorded. You will need to ensure you keep evidence of having issued the Financial Planning and Marketing Workshop information, for example, a copy of an email sent containing the information. The claimant should be able to discuss this information with you in relation to their business.</p>

<p>5.34. All participants must complete the mentoring phase and submit their business plan in enough time for any assessment and subsequent re-work, if applicable, to be completed in 12 weeks from the Start Date (i.e. the date of initial assessment).  This 12-week period should not to be extended further (unless, in very exceptional circumstances, you have agreement from the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, or any other appropriate member of <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> staff. Any such agreement should be recorded and include the name of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> member of staff.)</p>

<p>Note – It will be very rare for a reason for an extension to be agreed and you should engage with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach at the earliest opportunity where you consider that the 12-week timescale will not be met.</p>

<h3>Approval process</h3>

<p>5.35. You must review the business plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> submitted by the participant and consider whether it is at a suitable standard for the participant to move into self-employment and commence trading or, for BDGPs, to enable the business to develop and grow.</p>

<p>Note: In cases where two or more participants submit a joint plan you should also consider whether the business plan can sustain the participants.</p>

<p>5.36. You are required to administer an approval process for the participant’s Business Plan / <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>. All plans must be submitted, assessed and approved or not approved no later than 12 weeks from the Start Date, that is, the date of initial assessment, (unless, in very exceptional circumstances, you have agreement from the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, or any other appropriate member of <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> staff, which you should record any such agreement including the name of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> member of staff with whom you agreed this with).</p>

<p>Note: It will be very rare for a reason for an extension to be agreed and you should engage with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach at the earliest opportunity where you consider that the 12 week timescale will not be met.</p>

<p>5.37. You are required to retain copies of participant’s completed business plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>, and recommendation or feedback. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">Section 9</a> for further details of evidencing requirements.</p>

<p>5.38. The Business Mentor can make recommendations as to whether a participant’s business plan or  <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> is of a suitable standard to be assessed, however they must not be part of the final assessment process.  The final assessment must be carried out by someone who has NOT been directly involved with the participant.</p>

<p>5.39. Participants can submit their business plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> for consideration on more than one occasion, where it is initially declined, at your discretion.  Considerations when deciding whether a re-submission should be approved will include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the proportion of the 12 week period that has passed</li>
  <li>the likelihood that the business plan or <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> can be raised to the acceptable standard and assessed, or signed off in the time remaining</li>
</ul>

<p>5.40. When the Business Plan/<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> is approved you should notify the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach of the date the Business Plan/<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> was approved using the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form, the NEA1or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants UCNEA1form (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>)</p>

<p>Note: As the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed is not <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funded, the SCOTWALES version of the UCNEA1 form needs to be used for these participants, regardless of where the provision is delivered, as this version of the form does not include an <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo.</p>

<p>5.41. For individuals who have commenced self-employment, the confirmation of the business plan approval is required before the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach can process any claim for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance.  The <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participant must submit their application for the weekly allowance to Jobcentre Plus within 5 weeks of the (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>) claim termination date or, for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants, within 5 weeks of commencing trading (they will report a change of circumstance to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> to confirm they have started trading).</p>

<p>Note: If the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participant decides to start trading before the business plan is approved, they run the risk of missing the 5 weeks deadline, as one of the qualifying conditions is the business plan having been approved (see also paragraph 5.58 with regards to qualifying conditions for the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance).</p>

<p>5.42. Where participants who wish to start trading as self-employed have an approved Business Plan, you should sign post / notify the participant of companies which provide start-up financial support (see paragraphs 4.44 to 4.47).</p>

<h3>Business development phase: New business starts</h3>

<p>5.43. From the date the business plan is approved, the participant has a further 13 weeks to make the decision to sign off benefit and start trading.</p>

<p>5.44. They can also use the 13 weeks to further develop their business idea. For example, they can undertake additional market testing or apply for capital support such as a start-up loan.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr> participants will resume normal conditionality and will be expected to resume normal job seeking activity during this period.  For <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants, during this period, conditionality remains the same as during the mentoring phase.</p>

<p>5.45. This phase is optional for participants, and not all will use it.  For those that do we expect you to offer at least one point of contact with a business mentor during this period.  This offer must be documented.</p>

<h3>Commencement of Trading: New Business Starts</h3>

<p>5.46. For those participants who have their business plan approved and who subsequently start trading within the 13 weeks period following the pre start-up period you must continue to offer access to mentoring support for the first 52 weeks from the commencement of trading. During this 52 week period you must offer, as a minimum, 4 one-to-one meetings with a Business Mentor.</p>

<p>5.47. At the point the participant makes the decision to trade they should contact their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach in the first instance. Where the participant notifies you of their decision to trade, you should for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants: Check or signpost  them to their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach to check eligibility for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance, process the claim and close existing claim to benefits where appropriate (for example, <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants: Check or signpost them to report a change of circumstance regarding them stating trading and also for them to check eligibility for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance. They will also be advised as to the impact on their <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>5.48. You should also advise the participant to register their business with <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<p>5.49. Before you make a claim for the ‘Commencement of trading outcome’ you are required to satisfy yourselves that the participant has signed off <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> or <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>, and commenced trading.  For a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participant, you must satisfy yourself that they have reported a change of circumstances to register a trading start. The type of evidence you collect for this could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> registration</li>
  <li>confirmation of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> allowance claim (letter issued to claimant by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) where claimed by participant</li>
  <li>proof of benefit claim closed (letter issued to claimant by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>bank statement showing details of recent transactions or earnings</li>
  <li>invoices, purchase orders received or sent recently which are clearly in relation to the running of business</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Payments Scan: Please be aware that subject to the availability of resource and periodic reviews of data quality, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will release <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Payment scans to support <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> providers performance tracking activities during <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: the above list is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive</p>

<p>5.50. The evidence referred to in paragraph 5.49 is for you to satisfy yourself that it is reasonable to claim.  It is not evidence that shows that the claim can be or should be considered valid for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> validation purposes.</p>

<p>5.51. Participants for whom you are eligible to claim a Commencement of Trading fee will have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attended the initial assessment which has included the <abbr title="Link Up Start Up">LUSU</abbr> information and have been accepted onto the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 Provision by yourselves</li>
  <li>have a fully completed, assessed and approved Business Plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mentoring Post <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> Approval: <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed</h3>

<p>5.52. For those participants who have their <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> approved and who continue with the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 provision you must continue to offer access to mentoring support for the first 52 weeks from the date the <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> was approved.</p>

<p>5.53. During this 52-week period you must offer, as a minimum, four one to one meetings with a Business Mentor and access to a Peer Network Support.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance: New business starts</h3>

<p>5.54. To support participants to make the transition from benefits and become self-sufficient, during the first 26 weeks of trading, eligible participants are entitled to a <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance administered by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>. A <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance of £65 is paid for the first 13 weeks of trading, followed by a weekly allowance of £33 for the remaining 13 weeks.</p>

<p>5.55. The <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance is disregarded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> purposes</li>
  <li>for Income Tax purposes</li>
  <li>for National Insurance (but not Class 2 contributions) purposes</li>
  <li>for Tax credit purposes</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit purposes</li>
  <li>for child maintenance purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Participants will have to contact their Local Authority (<abbr title="Local Authorities">LA</abbr>) to confirm if any reduction they receive in their council tax bill is affected.</p>

<p>5.56. The allowance is payable subject to all the qualifying conditions being met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have progressed through the mentoring stage of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> and hold a valid business plan; that is one that has been ‘approved’ by the provider within the last 13 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: if the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participant has not been able to commence trading within 13 weeks of their business plan being approved, for reasons beyond their control, <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> may exercise discretion to extend this period within reason.</p>

<ul>
  <li>have closed their claim, where applicable (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>) to commence trading their business on a full-time basis (at least 16 hours per week)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants will not necessarily close their claim, they should however have notified a change of circumstance to <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> or <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> detailing when they started trading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>have signed an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> de minimis statement (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> regulations limit the amount of financial aid that can be given to commercial undertakings; <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> participants must, therefore, sign a statement confirming that receipt of the weekly allowance will not take them over permissible limits)</li>
  <li>have submitted their application for the weekly allowance to Jobcentre Plus within 5 weeks of the (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>) claim termination date or, for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants, within 5 weeks of commencing trading (they will report a change of circumstance to confirm they have started trading but may not necessarily terminate their claim for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>have a bank, building society or post office account. This can be either a personal account or a business account. Payments of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> weekly allowance can only be made direct to an account; a Post Office Card Account meets this criterion</li>
  <li>not be participating in the Work and Health Programme.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.57. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will administer and review the entitlement to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> allowance with the participant during week 6, 12 and 19 of the 26 week trading period.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>COVID-19</h4>

<p>DWP are currently reviewing the processes regarding claiming the NEA weekly allowance (also known as a Trading Allowance) and updating them in light of the COVID-19 event. Claimants should still be advised to contact JCP to apply for this allowance.</p>

<h2>Section 6: Participation, absences and changes of circumstances</h2>

<h3>Allotted Time</h3>

<h4>New business start</h4>

<p>6.01. The maximum <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 Allotted Time period for a new business start participant is 93 weeks.</p>

<p>6.02. This is made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>referral: 3 weeks</li>
  <li>mentor phase: up to 12 weeks</li>

</ul>

<p>6.03. Allotted Time is continuous and starts at the point of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 initial assessment.</p>

<p>6.04. This is the maximum period of time in which all outcomes for a participant must be achieved and claimed.</p>

<p>6.05. The period of 93 weeks will be for exceptional circumstances only and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> would expect the majority of participants to have completed 12 months of trading well within this period.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed</h4>

<p>6.06. The maximum <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 Allotted Time period for a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participant is 67 weeks.</p>

<p>6.07. This made up of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>referral: 3 weeks</li>
  <li>mentor phase: 12 weeks</li>
  <li>post trading: 52 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>6.08. Allotted Time is continuous and starts at the point of the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 initial assessment.</p>

<p>6.09. This is the maximum period of time in which all outcomes for a Participant must be achieved and claimed.</p>

<h3>Breaks in Period before Business Plan/<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> Sign Off</h3>

<h4>New business start</h4>

<p>6.10. Where a participant cease to participate in the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 provision during the Mentoring pre-business start-up stage, including where the reason is due to Covid-19, then this would need to be recorded in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> as a completer, using the most appropriate of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completed Provision</li>
  <li>Deceased (only use if death notified/confirmed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Once you have input the completer information into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, this will trigger the requirement to capture the customer’s destination/outcome for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> requirement purposes.</p>

<p>6.11. You should also signpost the participant to their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach and notify the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach using the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form (NEA1 or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants UCNEA1  form: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>.</p>

<p>6.12. If a participant who previously started <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> then dropped-out of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> during the Mentoring pre start-up stage enquires about returning to the scheme, the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will consider this request and make a new referral, if appropriate.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed</h4>

<p>6.13. If a participant informs you that they are leaving <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 during the mentoring pre-<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> sign off stage, then you should record this in your records but do not update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> with any completer information. You should advise the participant that they should also inform <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> of the change.  Completer information will be automatically recorded by <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> at the end of the allotted time period if no further information is input.</p>

<p>6.14. If they subsequently enquire about returning to the scheme then, assuming they are still eligible, and within the 67 week allotted time (which is continuous and has continued to run even if there has been a break in provision), the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will use their discretion in deciding whether or not re-referral is appropriate.</p>

<p>6.15. If the participant wishes to pursue the same business idea the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will ring you to explain the circumstances of the case and discuss the feasibility of the participant resuming the mentoring relationship at the point they left. In these cases the participant will only receive the balance of time left (for example, if the participant was previously on provision for 5 weeks then they would only have 7 weeks remaining if they re-joined).  If you agree then the participant can re-join the scheme at the point in which they left.</p>

<p>6.16. In some instances the participant may have erroneously been recorded as a leaver. In such instances, in order to re-open the provision and allow any remaining outcomes to be subsequently claimed, you will need to complete a PRaP14 form.  You will request that the line which holds the leaver information is removed, include the reason why, and send this to the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> team or <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.17. If the 67 week allotted time period has past, or you do not agree to the participant resuming the provision at the point they left, then a new referral will be made by the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach, but only if they consider a referral to be appropriate.</p>

<h3>Breaks during the first 26 weeks of trading: New Business Starts only</h3>

<p>6.18. If you are certain that the break will last for more than 13 weeks then you should record the participant as a completer in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, using the most appropriate of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completed Provision</li>
  <li>Deceased</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Once you have input the completer information into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, this will trigger the requirement to capture the customer’s destination or outcome for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> requirement purposes.  An ESF1420 end form must also be completed and returned to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> admin team (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-13">Annex 13</a> for more details regarding completing and submitting this form).</p>

<p>6.19	If the break is less than 13 weeks then you must not record them as a leaver on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> at the point they inform you they are taking a break. Upon the participant starting to trade again you will continue to work with them as long as this is still within the 92 week allotted time</p>

<p>Note: The maximum break allowed during the trading period is 13 weeks.</p>

<p>6.20	Following a break of not more than 13 weeks the participant will only receive the balance of 52 weeks mentoring support (e.g. if the participant has previously completed 12 weeks, they will have the remaining 40 weeks, subject to not exceeding the total 93 week allotted time to trade).</p>

<p>Note: You will only be able to claim the ‘Completion of 26 week trading outcome fee’ where the participant has completed the 26 week trading within the allotted time.</p>

<h4>Breaks during weeks 27 to 52 of trading: New Business Starts only</h4>

<p>6.21. If the participant ceases to trade during weeks 27 to 52 (and this is a break in trading rather than a permanent cessation of trading) then you should record this in your records but you must not record as a completer on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.  You should also inform <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> when a break occurs. Completer information will be automatically recorded by <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> at the end of the allotted time period if no further information is input.</p>

<p>6.22. Upon the participant starting to trade again, you will continue to work with them as long as this is still within the 93 week allotted time (which is continuous and has continued to run even if there has been a break in provision). In these circumstances the participant will only receive the balance of 52 weeks mentoring support (e.g. if the participant has previously completed 30 weeks, they will have the remaining 22 weeks left, subject to not exceeding the total 93 week allotted time to trade). Again, you should inform <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> when the support resumes.</p>

<p>6.23. In some instances the participant may have erroneously been recorded as a leaver. In such instances, in order to re-open the provision and allow any remaining input to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> to be made, you will need to complete a PRaP14 form.  You will request that the line which holds the leaver information is removed, include the reason why, and send this to the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> team/<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Breaks during the 52 week post <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> mentoring support: <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed only</h4>

<p>6.24. If a participant ceases to trade during the 52 week post <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> mentoring support (and this is a break in trading rather than a permanent cessation of trading), then you should record this in your records but do not update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> with any completer information. You should advise the participant that they should also inform <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> of the change.</p>

<p>6.25. If they subsequently enquire about returning to the scheme then, assuming they are still eligible, and within the 67 week allotted time (which is continuous and has continued to run even if there has been a break in provision), the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will use their discretion in deciding whether or not re-referral is appropriate.</p>

<p>6.26. The <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will ring you to explain the circumstances of the case and discuss the feasibility of the participant resuming the mentoring relationship at the point they left. In these cases the participant will only receive the balance of time left (for example, if the participant was previously trading and receiving mentoring post <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> support for 20 weeks then they would only have 32 weeks remaining if they re-joined).  If you agree then the participant can re-join the scheme at the point in which they left.</p>

<p>6.27. In some instances the participant may have erroneously been recorded as a leaver. In such instances, in order to re-open the provision and allow any remaining outcomes to be subsequently claimed, you will need to complete a PRaP14 form.  You will request that the line which holds the leaver information is removed, include the reason why, and send this to the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> team or <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.28. If the 67 week allotted time period has past, or you do not agree to the participant resuming the provision at the point they left, e.g. there is not enough time left to enable you to claim the remaining outcomes, then a new referral will be made by the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach (if they consider a referral to be appropriate).</p>

<h3>Non <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participant changes of circumstances</h3>

<p>6.29. It is the responsibility of the participant to notify <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> of any change in their circumstances that occur whilst they are on any element of <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>. Where a participant informs you of a change of circumstance, you are to direct the participants to immediately report the change to <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.30. For Current Benefit participants (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr> and <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>) you will be notified of any changes that impact upon the participant’s continued participation via unencrypted email using the CEPD1 form or via the Contingency Process detailed from paragraph 6.39.</p>

<p>Note: All notifications for Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>) will remain clerical notifications and will not be sent via email.  For further information with regards to <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases and what action you need to take please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/304518/pg-chapter-2.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 2: Delivering <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Programme Provision</a>.</p>

<p>6.31. On receipt of the notification of participant change of circumstances: ensure that the participant has been referred to you or your sub-contractors.</p>

<p>6.32. If referred by email, check that only one change of circumstances form has been attached to the email.</p>

<p>6.33. If you have received a change of circumstances form for an individual who has not been referred to you or your sub-contractors, or an email containing more than one customer record, or an email sent to an address other than your designated inbox you must notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.34. To mitigate the risk of data being lost, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Operational Security has restricted the number of client records (CEPD1 form) that may be transmitted via the unencrypted email process to a maximum of one client record (one CEPD1 form) per email.  If more than one client record per email is sent via the unencrypted email process, this will constitute a security breach and must be reported to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> as per current instructions (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260426/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8: Information Security</a>).</p>

<p>6.35. If you receive more than one CEPD1 form in an email and you are satisfied that the participants are attached to you or your sub-contractors, you may process the change as normal as well as reporting this as a security incident to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Operational Security (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260426/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8: Information Security</a>).</p>

<p>6.36. If you receive a CEPD1 form for an individual who is not attached to you or your sub-contractors, you must report the security incident (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260426/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance, Chapter 8: Information Security</a>) and then delete the email and CEPD1 form or forms.</p>

<p>6.37. The notification will be sent on a CEPD1 form from individual Jobcentre Plus email inbox addresses. The format of the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> email addresses will be ‘firstname.lastname@dwp.gov.uk’</p>

<p>6.38. To mitigate the risk of information other than that permitted by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> security, each email sent by Jobcentre Plus will adhere to the standard email protocols listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you will receive only one CEPD1 form per e mail</li>
  <li>
    <p>the standard wording displayed in the email “Subject Box” will be:</p>

    <p>CEPD1_New Enterprise Allowance <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr> number_participant surname_last 3 digits of participants <abbr title="National Insurance Number">NINO</abbr></p>

    <p>For example: CEPD1__New Enterprise Allowance_CPA11_Sample_56_C</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: It will not be possible for you to notify <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> of participant change of circumstances via unencrypted email.</p>

<h3>Contingency process</h3>

<p>6.39. There may be occasions when due to circumstances such as <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> failure you are temporarily unable to receive change of circumstances via unencrypted email from <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> offices.</p>

<p>6.40. In these circumstances you must ensure that your District <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> is kept informed of the situation and how long you anticipate it lasting.</p>

<p>6.41. The <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> will inform <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> colleagues of the situation and they will temporarily 	suspend the use of unencrypted email.</p>

<p>6.42. If you anticipate the situation will continue for 48 hours or longer you must revert to the Change of Circumstances clerical contingency of receiving the CEPD1 through the post until the problem is resolved and you are able to use the unencrypted email again.</p>

<p>6.43. Your District <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> should be kept updated and prior to you starting to use the contingency arrangements you must inform the <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> when these arrangements will start. Also before you begin to use the unencrypted email process again you must notify the <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.44. If <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> have an I.T. failure, your District <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> will notify you if the problem will last for longer than 48 hours and that <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will revert to the contingency arrangements of sending the CEPD1 form through the post.</p>

<p>6.45. Once resolved, your <abbr title="Third Party Provision Manager">TPPM</abbr> will notify you when you can expect to start receiving electronic change of circumstances forms again.</p>

<h3>Universal Credit participant changes of circumstance</h3>

<p>6.46. It is the responsibility of the participant to notify the Universal Credit Service Centre (<abbr title="Universal Credit Service Centre">UCSC</abbr>) of any change in their circumstances that occur whilst they are on <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> provision. Where a participant informs you of a Change of Circumstance (<abbr title="Change of Circumstance">CoC</abbr>), you are to direct participants to immediately report the change to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>.</p>

<p>6.47. The <abbr title="Universal Credit Service Centre">UCSC</abbr> will then review the <abbr title="Change of Circumstance">CoC</abbr> and notify you of relevant changes on form UC78 which will be sent to you by post. You must then consider the impact of the <abbr title="Change of Circumstance">CoC</abbr> on your delivery for the participant (for example, restrictions in activity requirements where appropriate) and take immediate action.</p>

<h3>Participant changes address</h3>

<p>6.48. Once the participant has started <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, and you are notified of a change of address, if the change of address means that the participant continues to attend a <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> office within the current Contract Package Area (<abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>), their participation on the scheme will be unaffected. However, if the change means that the participant will attend at a <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> office outside the <abbr title="Contract Package Area">CPA</abbr>, you will be expected to consider if continued participation is appropriate.</p>

<p>6.49. If the participant remains in the local travel to work area participation should continue (participants are not required to participate in any location which would normally take the participant more than 90 minutes via public transport to travel to or from their home).</p>

<p>6.50. If the participant moves further afield you should consider if suitable arrangements can be put in place to continue delivery of the service. If suitable arrangements cannot be made, your delivery requirements will cease and the participant should be recorded as a completer in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#leavers">leavers</a>).</p>

<h3>Participant holiday: new business</h3>

<p>6.51. Where a participant plans to go on holiday during the 12 week pre start-up period you should advise them to notify their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach before the planned holiday.</p>

<p>6.52. Prior to the start of trading if the participant is going on holiday (home or abroad), the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach will consider if it might be more appropriate for the participant to delay launching their business, and therefore their claim for the allowance, until they return.</p>

<h3>Leavers</h3>

<p>6.53. Where a participant notifies you they no longer wish to participate in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, you should refer the participant to their <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach and notify the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach using the appropriate <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> feedback form (NEA1 or for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants UCNEA1 form: see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-3">Annex 3</a>).</p>

<p>6.54. Only when you are certain that the participant will definitely not return should you record the participant as a completer in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, using the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completed Provision</li>
  <li>Deceased (only use if death notified or nconfirmed by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Once you have input the completer information into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, this will trigger the requirement to capture the customer’s destination/outcome for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> requirement purposes. An ESF1420 end form must be completed and returned to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> admin team (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-13">Annex 13</a> for further details)</p>

<p>Note: Providers must only report participants for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> purposes the first time they start and leave provision. If the claimant subsequently re-joins the provision, then no further <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> forms are completed.</p>

<p>Note: There may also be circumstances where a work coach removes the participant from provision. When you are notified this is the case you will record individual as “completed provision”.</p>

<h4>Participant changes business idea: new business only</h4>

<p>6.55. Where the participant changes their business idea while participating in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, the actions you take will depend on where the participant is in the scheme.</p>

<h3>Change during start-up period</h3>

<p>6.56. Should the participant change their business idea during the pre start-up period (prior to business plan sign off), you should, determine if the revised business idea is viable or not and then, where possible or time permitting, work with the participant to re-develop their business plan to accommodate any changes. If this cannot be accommodated in the time remaining (including any extension requests) you should record the participant as completing provision on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and complete and return an ESF1420 end form to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> admin team (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-13">Annex 13</a> for instructions regarding the ESF1420 end form).</p>

<p>6.57. Subject to discussion and agreement with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach a new referral will be made in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> where the participant wishes to develop a new business idea.</p>

<h3>Change following business plan sign off</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>For changes to the business idea, made during the start-up period, following Business Plan sign-off, or following the commencement of trading, the requirement for the participant to be recorded as completed provision and, where required, a new referral made should be suspended during the Covid-19 period.</p>

<p>Where there is a change of business idea you will need to update the Business Plan/ and their records to reflect the change, and include the term “due to Covid-19” to identify that new guidance was being followed. There is no need to seek/ have JCP permission to make the change.</p>

<p>You will still need to consider the suggested change to the business and whether you can offer support. You retain the option to continue working with the participant, using the recommended easements, or to end provision (as per paragraph 6.56), if the decision was that support could not be given.</p>
</div>

<p>6.58. Should the participant change their business idea following the sign off of the business plan you should record the participant as completing provision. Subject to discussion and agreement with the <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach a new referral will be made in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> where the participant wishes to develop a new business idea.</p>

<h3>Change following commencement of trading</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>COVID-19</h4>

<p>For changes to the business idea, made during the start-up period, following Business Plan sign-off, or following the commencement of trading, the requirement for the participant to be recorded as completed provision and, where required, a new referral made should be suspended during the Covid-19 period. Paragraph 6.60 will also not apply.</p>

<p>Where there is a change of business idea you will need to update the Business Plan/ and their records to reflect the change, and include the term “due to Covid-19” to identify that new guidance was being followed. There is no need to seek/ have JCP permission to make the change.</p>

<p>You will still need to consider the suggested change to the business and whether you can offer support. You retain the option to continue working with the participant, using the recommended easements, or to end provision (as per paragraph 6.59), if the decision was that support could not be given.</p>
</div>

<p>6.59. Should the participant change their business idea following commencement of trading, you will need to consider the suggested change to the business and whether you can offer support within the time remaining at the point of change. You retain the option to continue working with the participant or to end provision. If the decision was that support could not be given, you should record the participant as completing provision on <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and complete and return an ESF1420 end form to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> admin team (see Annex 13 for instructions regarding the ESF1420 end form).  Where you decide that you can offer support within the remaining timeframe, you will need to update the Business Plan/ and your records to reflect the change, there is no need to seek/ have <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> permission to make the change.</p>

<p>6.60. In all the scenarios above the proposed business idea must be demonstrably different from the previous business idea / business that ceased trading before.</p>

<h3>Unacceptable behaviour</h3>

<p>6.61. Participants on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> provision have a responsibility to behave in an appropriate manner, just as they would if they were in employment and you must explain what constitutes appropriate behaviour as part of the participant’s initial assessment.</p>

<p>6.62. Where cases of misconduct or unacceptable behaviour by participants arise, you must immediately deal with it in the most appropriate manner.</p>

<p>6.63. If a participant’s behaviour is such that effective participation is not possible, in the first instance you must discuss this with <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coach. As a last resort a decision may be made to exclude from provision (further information regarding unacceptable behaviour can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/274320/pg-chapter-2.pdf">Chapter 2 of Generic Provider Guidance</a>).</p>

<h3>Christmas and New Year opening</h3>

<p>6.64. Where you are closed, the period of closure will be counted towards completed weeks for completion of 26 weeks trading outcome fee purposes (up to a maximum of 7 working days).</p>

<p>6.65. You must ensure your designated point of contact for the booking of Initial Engagement Meetings is resourced where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> referral offices are open over Christmas and New Year.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> participant results</h3>

<p>6.66. It is a key requirement that for <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> purposes you notify results for participants who complete provision (where a participant completes the provision duration, or completes early).</p>

<p>6.67. <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> results can be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improvements in labour market situation (employed, unemployed or inactive status)</li>
  <li>movement into education or training</li>
  <li>gaining a qualification</li>
  <li>gaining basic skills</li>
</ul>

<p>6.68. These results must occur within the provision duration or within 4 weeks (28 days) following the participants completion date. Results that manifest themselves outside this period do not need to be reported.</p>

<p>6.69. You must report the labour market situation for all participants that complete provision and also where it is established that the participant has gained basic skills or a qualification whilst on provision or moved into education or training. Prior to contract start you will be advised of the method of collection for these results.</p>

<p>Note: Along with the result information you must also supply <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> with the latest contact details you hold for the participant.</p>

<p>6.70. Further information on obtaining evidence can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/591548/ESF_Data_Evidence_Requirements_v2.pdf"><abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Data Evidence Requirements: Eligibility and results guidance</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>With regards to the ESF requirements set out in paragraphs 6.66 to 6.70, please note that the ESF 2014-2020 guidance has been updated with regards to Covid-19. Please refer to the ESF Guidance to identify any changes to ESF requirements.</p>
</div>

<h2>Section 7: Claiming outcomes and <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> actions</h2>

<p>Please Note - Some Providers have remained on the Cost+ Model, whilst some have reverted back to the Payments by Result Model (PBR).</p>

<p>In the following chapter any references to outcomes refers to an outcome for <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> purposes only for Cost + Providers and an outcome that will generate a payment for PBR Providers.</p>

<p>Providers should, where applicable, refer to their specific contract variation for dates when PBR outcomes can be claimed from.</p>

<h3>Claiming outcomes: General</h3>

<p>7.01. For all outcomes you are required to maintain a robust system of internal control which must include appropriate checks, monitoring arrangements and adequate records to demonstrate that you are entitled to claim the outcome. The records maintained need to be sufficient not only to support an outcome, but also to allow internal management checks, scrutiny from other external bodies and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>/<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> validation checks. See evidencing requirements at <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">Section 9</a>.</p>

<p>7.02. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> does not prescribe the way in which you should track individuals or record information about their self-employment. There is however specific information that you are required to input to the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> system, via the ‘job details’ screen when you submit the claim. This includes the following self-employment details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the contact details of the self-employed individual including the business address, contact name, full business telephone number and e-mail address</li>
  <li>business title; start date of trading period (day after ceasing benefit claim / notifying <abbr title="Change of Circumstance">CoC</abbr> for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> claimants)</li>
  <li>end date of 26 week trading period (not required for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants)</li>
  <li>the number of hours worked each week</li>
  <li>the working pattern</li>
  <li>the Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>) code that best describes the business. (See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-industrial-classification-of-economic-activities-sic">Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (<abbr title="Standard Industrial Classification">SIC</abbr>)</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>7.03. This information must be provided for each claim and failure to provide all or part of this information may result in the outcome being invalid. Under the cost model these outcomes attract no fees, the information is required for <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> purposes.</p>

<p>Note: You will be required to input this information into <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> for the following outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commencement of trading outcome – new business starts only</li>
  <li>completion of 26 weeks trading outcome – new business starts only</li>
  <li>start following initial assessment – <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed only</li>
  <li>completed mentoring phase and <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> – <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed only</li>
  <li>26 weeks trading duration AND signoff from participant to confirm completion of objectives agreed by participant and provider in <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> (the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> system still shows the outcome title as Met Exceeded minimum income floor) - <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed only.</li>
  <li>52 weeks sustained trading duration</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> actions: General</h3>

<p>7.04. There are points within <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> where Providers must ensure they update <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 referrals on the Provider Referrals and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>) system. The below are the key actions required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acknowledge each <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 referral</li>
  <li>record a <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Phase 2 initial assessment result (start, fail to attend, did not start) for each Participant (within 20 working days of referral to initial assessment)</li>
  <li>record where Participants complete pre start-up period</li>
  <li>where making outcome claims, record all details in relation to the outcomes i.e. start, completing pre start-up period, start trading and completion of 6 months / 26 weeks of trading in the Job Details screen, prior to making each the claim</li>
  <li>record the details of completion of 12 months / 52 weeks of trading (both NBS and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>claims via the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> system must be made in order with the necessary criteria having been met, for example you cannot input a claim for 6 months/26 weeks sustained Business unless you have claimed a start of trading outcome</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> will automatically input an end date at the end of the allotted time period if no end date is held. However, you should ensure dates are entered via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> as quickly as possible and within stated timescales.</p>

<p>7.05. You will use the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> system to receive referrals and to record participant activity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for New Business <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> provision when Starting Trading Date or completion of 26 weeks or 6 months Trading for <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> purposes, subject to validation by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">section 9: Evidence Requirements</a> for further information on evidence required)</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed the inputs will be <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> programme start date (following initial assessment), confirmation of the assessment of the <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> following the initial mentoring phase and confirmation of 26 weeks trading duration AND signoff from participant to confirm completion of objectives agreed by participant and provider in <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.06. You will therefore need to have met relevant security requirements when contracts go live. See more information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/provider-referrals-and-payments-prap-system-for-dwp">Provider Referrals and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>) system for <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>7.07. It should be noted that while the vast majority of referrals will be made through <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, there may be a very small number of referrals made clerically. These are cases where <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> has granted the participant ‘Special Customer Record Status’ due to certain personal circumstances.  See <a class="govuk-link" href="#scr-cases"><abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr> cases</a> for further information.</p>

<p>7.08. Direct access to <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> will be limited to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Prime Providers or Contract Holders.</p>

<p>7.09. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will use Management Information (<abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>) presented by <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> for the ongoing management of the scheme and for discussion with individual providers.</p>

<p>7.10. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-4">annex 4</a> in relation to <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> requirements including <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements. Before submitting a claim for any fee, you must satisfy yourself that you are entitled to do so and that the claim meets the definitions detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-5">annex 5</a>.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> actions: New business start-up</h3>

<h4>Commencement of programme</h4>

<p>7.11. You will receive a referral for an Initial Assessment via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if the person is accepted onto the programme: You will input the same date for both Date 1 and Date 2:</p>

This should help to avoid any doubt at a later stage, should the participant be asked regarding this, as part of any validation conversation.</p>

<p>Note: that if in validation, we have insufficient information to validate the claim, then the claim could fail.</p>

<p>7.47. You are required to make this evidence available for testing when requested by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and other external bodies when requested, and it must be retained.</p>

<h2>Section 8: Validation</h2>

<p>Please Note - Pre/Post Outcome Validation refers to Providers on the Cost + Model, for those Providers now on the Payment by Result Model the Pre/Post Outcomes refers to Pre/Post Payment validation.</p>

<h3>Validation action</h3>

<p>8.01. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will seek to verify the validity of the provider’s claims for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new business starts
    <ul>
      <li>commencement of trading outcome</li>
      <li>completion of 26 week trading outcome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for existing <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> self-employed
    <ul>
      <li>Initial Assessment</li>
      <li>Mentoring Phase including assessment of <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr>
</li>
      <li>completion of 26 weeks trading and <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> outcome</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>8.02. Validation will be undertaken primarily post outcome on the basis of a representative sample of claims (up to 100% of those available) selected by contract.</p>

<p>8.03. Validation will be a feature, as necessary, to ensure participants have, where outcome definitions require, ceased to claim a legacy benefit or, for those continuing to claim <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>, that an appropriate change has been registered. For customers on dual claims the legacy part of their benefit must cease and the change shown in the <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> component.</p>

<p>8.04. Claims to be checked will be selected on a random basis and in sufficient numbers to be considered, at the discretion of the Department, as representative of the volume of claims (for that outcome) from which the sample is drawn.</p>

<p>8.05. The following paragraphs broadly outline the Department’s validation methodology. You should read this section in conjunction with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446787/pg-chapter-5-v3.3.pdf">Chapter 5: Generic Provider Guidance: Evidencing and Validating Payments</a>.</p>

<p>8.06. If you have any queries about an <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> fee claim you have submitted via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> please send an e-mail entitled ‘Payment Query’ to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:NEATEAM.PPVT@DWP.GOV.UK">NEATEAM.<abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a> In the body of your e-mail please provide the ERS number, the date the claim was entered via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and details of the nature of your query. The <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Provider Payment Validation Team (<abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>) will endeavour to respond to all e-mail enquiries within 24 hours of receipt.</p>

<p>8.07. If you have queries relating specifically to validation processes or policy please email your enquiry to Provider Payment and Validation (<abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>) inbox at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PPVT.POLICYANDGUIDANCEQUERIES@DWP.GOV.UK"><abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>.POLICYANDGUIDANCEQUERIES@<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Pre Outcome Validation</h3>

<p>8.08. Whilst <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to check claims at any point, the intention at the outset is to use the pre-outcome validation check on the 26 Weeks of Trading outcome.</p>

<p>8.09. Claims will undergo an automated Off Benefit Check (<abbr title="Off Benefit Check">OBC</abbr>). This automated check is an interface with <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and the Customer Information System (<abbr title="Customer Information System">CIS</abbr>), the departmental system that holds benefit history details.</p>

<p>8.10. The check is to determine whether the individual has ceased their claim for benefit or remained off benefit for 26 weeks. The check is against the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jobseekers Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Employment Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Income Support (<abbr title="Income Support">IS</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Universal Credit (<abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants may not have ceased their claim to benefit. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#para-816">paragraphs 8.16 and 8.17</a> for the action to take with <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> participants.</p>

<p>8.11. Where an insufficient period off the benefits listed at paragraph 8.11 is found, the claim will fail.</p>

<p>8.12. Claims which are put on hold by <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> because of a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> interest will be investigated by <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> to establish whether <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> systems show the participant has registered the necessary change.</p>

<p>8.13. Claims passing these checks will be available for post-outcome validation.</p>

<p>8.14. Those that fail will be backed out of <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. This will allow you to re-submit another Completion of 26 weeks trading outcome, once any necessary corrections have been made.</p>

<p>8.15. Prior to re-submission it is expected that the necessary steps will have been taken to further establish the validity of the claim and the information supplied with it.</p>

<p>8.16. Where there is a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Interest you are required to enter the prefix ‘Uni Cred’ in the Employer Name Field of the Employment Details screen via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.  This must have been added before submitting any outcome payment claim.  Taking this action will allow <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> to identify <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Interest cases and apply the correct validation methodology and criteria.</p>

<p>8.17. All claims that include live records of <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> will fail the automated <abbr title="Off Benefit Check">OBC</abbr> and will be placed on-hold. <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will filter all <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Completion of 26 weeks trading Outcome and conduct pre-outcome validation for each claim.</p>

<h3>Post Outcome Validation</h3>

<p>8.18. All claims recording an outcome will be available for post outcome sampling.</p>

<p>8.19. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will seek to verify the validity of the provider’s claims and may at its discretion check a representative sample of claims (up to 100% of those available) across a defined time period.</p>

<p>8.20. Claims to be checked will be selected on a random basis and in sufficient numbers to be considered at the discretion of the Department, as representative of the volume of claims (for that outcome) from which the sample is drawn.</p>

<p>8.21. Validation will rely on reference to sources of evidence independent of the provider (and its supply chain) and may encompass, for example, information held already by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> personnel or on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> systems (or those of other government departments) as well as evidence secured direct from the participant.</p>

<p>8.22. Claims to be checked will be selected on a random basis and in sufficient numbers to be considered at the discretion of the Department, as representative of the volume of claims (for that outcome) from which the sample is drawn.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Commencement of Trading” claims will be compared to benefit systems to establish whether the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Allowance is in payment. Where it is, the participant’s work coach will have confirmed with the participant that their Business Plan has been agreed and that they have subsequently commenced trading. Where this is established the claim will pass. Where the Allowance is not in payment, perhaps because the participant has not claimed it and or has remained on their original benefit, <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will pursue a conversation with the participant to establish whether the criteria have been met and therefore that the claim can be passed</li>
  <li>“26 Weeks of Trading” claims (which will have passed pre-payment validation) will be checked through a mix of contacting the participant; liaison with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> staff,  reference to supporting <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems on which progress will have been recorded and contacting employers or contractors if applicable</li>
  <li>existing self-employment claims (i.e. claims for a “Start”, “<abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> assessment” and/or A Completion of 26 weeks trading and <abbr title="Business Development and Growth Plan">BDGP</abbr> outcome), all of which will relate to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants, will be undertaken through a combination of liaison with Work Services Directorate (part of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and typically the supporting <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> systems on which progress will have been recorded, direct consultation with the Participant themselves and employers/contractors (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>8.23. Where there is a <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Interest you are required to enter the prefix ‘Uni Cred’ in the Employer Name Field of the Employment Details screen via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. This must have been added before submitting any outcome claim.  Taking this action will allow <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> to identify <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> Interest cases and apply the correct validation methodology and criteria.</p>

<h3>Outcomes of validation</h3>

<p>8.24. Each checked claim will be classified as either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pass – Validation checks have confirmed the outcome definition and associated requirements have been met - This may include claims which differ in detail from the outcome identified in validation but with the parameters of variance and acceptable risk deemed acceptable by CMPD Governance</li>
  <li>Fail - Validation checks have confirmed the outcome definition and or associated requirements have NOT been met - This may include where validation activity has identified a valid outcome but which differs from that claims to such that it is beyond the parameters of variance and level of risk deemed acceptable by CMPD Governance</li>
  <li>Unable to Validate – Despite reasonable validation checks we have been unable to conclusively confirm the outcome definition and or associated requirements have or have not been met</li>
</ul>

<p>8.25. Where the Department has checked a sample of claims the rate of error found will be extrapolated across the population of claims (including the sample) and consequent overpayments will be recovered.</p>

<p>8.26. In cases where <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> is experiencing difficulty making contact with the individual, we may contact you to confirm the details you have supplied in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> may also contact you where you have submitted incorrect or incomplete information (for example, incomplete telephone numbers). You are required to establish the correct information and supply <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> within 5 days of receipt of the query. If you do not provide the detail that enables <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> an attempt at validation, the claim will fail validation.</p>

<p>8.27. Providers must not remove job details from the mandatory fields in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> at any time. Should you identify any data input errors (e.g. incorrect dates / invalid claim), you can request for it to be removed / amended using the required form <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> 14 as detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-6">annex 6</a>. Please ensure you use the correct version of the form, depending on whether the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo should be present of not. The “Notes” at Annex 6 provide further detail.</p>

<p>Note: When you request a claim to be removed (backing out) you must check and list any proceeding claim lines on the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> 14 form. If you fail to do this the form will be rejected and returned to you with an explanation for the rejection. You will be asked to review the request and if appropriate, resubmit the form to include all relevant lines to be backed out. You should not back out any claim that has been requested for sampling see para 8.29</p>

<p>8.28. <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will keep <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> about claims that have been submitted inaccurately, or are incomplete. This will be used to inform other activities that may take place, for instance, consistently submitting poor quality claims could indicate a weakness in providers’ systems and feedback of this nature may therefore inform Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) activities see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260423/pg-chapter-6.pdf">Chapter 6 of the Generic provider Guidance Chapter 6: Provider assurance</a>.</p>

<h3>Extrapolation</h3>

<p>8.29. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will draw a monthly sample of outcomes to be validated and upon which extrapolation will be based. Providers should not seek to back out any outcomes once the sampling process is underway for any given month’s outcomes. The timetable for sampling will be communicated to providers.</p>

<p>8.30. All claims that fail post-outcome validation, contribute to the error rate for extrapolation. The error rate is calculated using the total number of errors found within all samples that make up a validation round (usually 6 months) divided by the total number of outcomes in the wider population of all claims made in the time period.</p>

<p>8.31. Once all the checks have been completed, including those that have been reviewed, you will receive an extrapolation report that details the validation decisions for all outcomes within the sample to enable you to reconcile against your records. The report includes the found error rate.”</p>

<p>8.32. Providers should be aware that a review process is in place for all failures and unable to validate cases, and these can be reviewed proportionately. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/446787/pg-chapter-5-v3.3.pdf">Chapter 5: Generic Provider Guidance: Evidencing and Validating Payments</a> for full details.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>)</h3>

<p>8.33. The <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PRAP.support@dwp.gov.uk">PRAP.support@dwp.gov.uk</a> will carry out administration and approval functions to support Provider referrals and attachment payments via <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Special Customer Records</h3>

<p>8.34. If you have been notified by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> that a claimant has been granted Special Customer Record (<abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>) all records remain clerical. To make any outcome claim you will need to use a PRAP11NEA2 form (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-2">Annex 2</a>). Please ensure you use the correct version of the form, depending on whether the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> logo should be present or not. The “Notes” at Annex 2 provide further detail.</p>

<p>8.35. For this clerical process, one claim form should be printed and completed for each claimable outcome and be sent to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Joyce Hughes, Operational Manager
<br>Wirral Provider Payment Validation Team
<br>29 Price Street
<br>Room 216, 3rd floor
<br>Brunswick House
<br>Birkenhead
<br>CH41 6JN
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>8.36. When the claim is received by Wirral <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr>, they will firstly confirm that the case is indeed a <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.37. If the case is confirmed to not be a <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>, the claim will be rejected and you will be advised that the claim must be referred as per the normal process.</p>

<p>8.38. If the case is a confirmed <abbr title="Special Customer Records">SCR</abbr>, Wirral <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will validate the claim by using the appropriate combination of Central Payment System, (to check for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> payments which may assist in the validation of stages 1-3), validate directly with the participant and perform an off benefit check where appropriate (dependant on which outcome is being claimed).</p>

<p>8.39. <abbr title="Payment Validation Team">PPVT</abbr> will endeavour to process these claims within 30 days of receipt of a valid claim.</p>

<p>8.40. Further information regarding sending information to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260426/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Chapter 8 of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance</a>, paragraph 36.</p>

<p>8.41. Further information regarding managing SCRs is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/332517/pg-chapter-2.pdf">Chapter 2 of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Generic Provider Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>8.42. All clerical documents carrying personal information should be retained securely in line with the Data Protection Act Principles.</p>

<h2>Section 9: Evidence requirements</h2>

<h3>Evidence requirements</h3>

<p>9.01. You must keep evidence that can support delivery of the scheme as specified within this provider guidance document. To confirm that electronic signatures, emails, scanned documents, texts etc. would all be acceptable to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, as part of any evidence you retain (see also paragraph 9.03).</p>

<p>Note: An electronic signature is data in electronic form which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign. This can be as simple as a name entered on an electronic document, but it should be reasonable to assume, from the information retained, that this person in question is linked to the signature/ evidence retained. The requirement remains to have evidence that shows that a particular individual has undertaken the Initial Assessment, regardless of how that Initial Assessment is undertaken.</p>

<p>9.02. This evidence must be retained to support checks by European Social Fund (<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr>) Performance and Compliance (<abbr title="Performance and Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr>) and <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit activity, as well as checks undertaken by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and other external bodies.</p>

<p>9.03. With regards to evidencing requirements the overriding principle is that that you need to have sufficient evidence to satisfy yourself that you can, for example, make a claim to record <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr>, for commencement of trading and that it is reasonable to make the claim.  This would include it being reasonable to show that the evidence is not something that could be easily produced by another party, so an email by itself may not be sufficient, but as part of a suite of evidence could be. You are reminded that having such evidence is not a guarantee that a claim will pass validation.</p>

<p>9.04. You are required to maintain a robust system of internal controls which must include appropriate checks, monitoring arrangements and adequate records to demonstrate that you are entitled to make the claim.</p>

<p>9.05. You must keep information to support your claims and submit it to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> when 	requested and as part of the claim process. This can include information about the individual and their self-employment or job details.</p>

<p>9.06. <a class="govuk-link" href="#table-1">Table 1</a> lists the documentation that must be retained as a minimum for both new business starts and <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants.</p>

<p>Note: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements do not apply to <abbr title="Universal Credit">UC</abbr> existing self-employed participants.</p>

<p>9.07. Documentation must be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>properly organised (it is recommended that all the required information for an individual participant is held on a personal file linked to a contract number, which is cross referenced to a main file to aid retrieval of specific documents to support audit activity)</li>
  <li>maintained in good condition to protect the integrity of the information</li>
  <li>secure, controlled and easy to access if and when required for audit purposes throughout the retention period</li>
</ul>

<p>9.08. A document retention policy must be in place and submitted to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> within 4 weeks of the contract start. This must include details on how the policy will be implemented, maintained and monitored by the Prime Provider.  Where <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> match funding applies, you must adhere to the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> specific document retention requirements (see<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf"> Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a> for further details).</p>

<p>9.09. The Prime Provider (including their supply chain) can be audited by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> or <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Internal Auditors and other bodies.</p>

<h2>Section 10: Additional information</h2>

<h3>Fraud prevention</h3>

<p>10.01. If you suspect that a participant is committing fraud you should follow the procedures outlined via the National Fraud Hotline. See information on how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-benefit-fraud">report benefit fraud</a>.</p>

<h3>Data protection</h3>

<p>10.02. In order to protect departmental information appropriately, you must put into effect and maintain the security measures and safeguards appropriate to the nature and use of the information throughout your supply chain.</p>

<p>10.03. All providers of services to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> must comply, and be able to demonstrate compliance, with the Department’s relevant policies and standards including the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Information Systems Security Standards.</p>

<p>10.04. These Standards are based on and follow the same format as International Standard 27001, but with specific reference to the Department’s use.</p>

<p>10.05. Departmental information must not be processed outside the United Kingdom without the express written permission of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in line with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Security Policy for Contractors and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p>10.06. Security assurance for you and your supply chain is through completing a draft security 	plan. You will have submitted a draft security plan as part of your response to this competition and are expected to maintain this. This will set out the security measures to be implemented and maintained by the prime provider throughout the entire supply chain in relation to all aspects of the service, including processes associated with delivery.</p>

<p>10.07. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260426/pg-chapter-8.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance: Chapter 8: Information Security</a>.</p>

<p>10.08. The Head of Compliance will continue to regularly report the number and outcomes of data security checks carried out during the previous quarter to the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Permanent Secretary.</p>

<p>10.09. In the event of any breach of information security which may or may not result in an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (<abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>), <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will consider whether a major breach of contract has occurred within the Terms and Conditions (<abbr title="Terms &amp; Conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>). You will be responsible for paying any fine levied on <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> following an investigation by the <abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr> in relation to a provider breach.</p>

<h3>Legislation and principal regulations</h3>

<p>10.10. You must ensure that you and your supply chain remain compliant with current and future changes in the law and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policy. For example:</p>

<p>10.22. As you will be aware, your approach to diversity and equality is an important factor in the delivery of a <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> contract. You should refer to the Diversity and Equality Schedule in the contract documentation you have and raise any queries and issues with your Performance Manager.</p>

<h3>Accident reporting</h3>

<p>10.23. All relevant accidents and incidents should be reported to your <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> contact. In addition to your normal arrangements for managing and reporting accidents which may involve participants on your own scheme, you must also notify your Performance Manager immediately by telephone of any relevant accident.

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>10.24. It is important all organisations responsible for the delivery of <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provisions are committed to raising standards. The primary responsibility for improving the quality of the scheme rests with you, and you will be expected to build and maintain a culture of continuous improvement.</p>

<p>10.25. The key elements of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> approach to quality improvement are set out in the documents found using the following links:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260425/pg-chapter-7.pdf">Generic Guidance Chapter 7: Self-Assessment</a></li>

</ul>

<p>10.26. This provides the basis of our approach to maintaining and improving quality in <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Contracted Employment Provision.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 2014 to 2020 programme requirements</h3>

<p>10.29. Providers must display an ESF1420 poster at all delivery locations.</p>

<p>10.30. Full information regarding <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/569594/pg-chapter-11b.pdf">Generic Provider Guidance Chapter 11b: <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> requirements 2014 to 2020 (England Only)</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>With regards to the ESF requirements set out in paragraphs 10.17 to 10.20, please note that the ESF 2014-2020 guidance has been updated with regards to Covid-19. Please refer to the ESF Guidance to identify any changes to ESF requirements</p>
</div>

<h3>Irregularities or potential fraud</h3>

<p>10.31. You have a responsibility to minimise the risk of fraud within the programmes delivered. Funding should be safeguarded against fraud and irregularity on the part of directors, employees or subcontractors. Such abuse would include false or misleading claims for payments, whether designed to gain immediate financial advantage or overstate performance.</p>

<p>10.32. Deliberate or persistent non-compliance with prescribed standards of delivery would also be subject to investigation if a possible financial impact was identified. In such instances <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may contact you to pursue enquiries relating to potential abuses of funding. Their remit will be, primarily, to investigate fraud and financial irregularity but it can in certain circumstances extend to non-compliance with contract and guidance.</p>

<p>10.33. You should therefore ensure that all staff involved in the delivery and management of contracts are fully aware of the risks and consequences of any falsification, manipulation, deception or misrepresentation. Occurrence of fraud within any individual programme could lead to the termination of all contracts held as well as civil or criminal proceedings against those implicated.</p>

<h3>Performance Management and Strategic Supplier Management</h3>

<p>11.01. <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> contracts are managed by Category Managers and Performance Managers. 	Provider performance will be based on an assessment of performance which 	considers a range of factors including contract value, compliance with the contract, performance and security.</p>

<p>11.02. You are responsible for managing the contract, including addressing poor performance, arrangements with mentors or advisers and also the performance of your sub-contractors.</p>

<p>11.03. You must ensure that all systems and processes used for the monitoring and recording of performance are robust, provide a clear audit trail of evidence, and give confidence to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> that you and your supply chain are delivering the scheme in accordance with your overall contractual obligations.</p>

<p>11.04. You must appoint appropriate named contacts who will work with the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Category Manager and Performance Managers to ensure that <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> is delivered as specified in the contract and that required standards and performance levels are met.</p>

<p>11.05. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Performance Managers will hold regular Contract Performance Review (<abbr title="Contract Performance Review">CPR</abbr>) meetings with you which will focus on achieving contractual performance and service targets and improving performance and delivery in line with the Contract. Staff representing <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> districts and Benefit Delivery Centres may also attend these meetings.</p>

<p>11.06. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will, in the main, use <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> presented by <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and from assurance activities for the ongoing management of the scheme and for discussion with you. However, you must ensure that you hold and maintain data or evidence for each participant as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-9">Section 9</a> and it is available on request.</p>

<p>11.07. As <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is committed to transparency on how its programmes are working, you need to be aware that <abbr title="Management Information">MI</abbr> may also feed into published Official Statistics on <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>. Consequently, you must treat information they have access to as restricted, and for your use only, ahead of formal publication. Official Statistics may also cover performance expectations at provider level.</p>

This 12-day requirement is to ensure that you can have fully informed discussions regarding the sample when the compliance checks are carried out.</p>

<p>11.16. You are expected to have the necessary remote <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> equipment, which must comply with the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> policies as defined in the Terms &amp; Conditions, at “Schedule 6- Security Requirements and Plan”, which you can bring to the location to enable <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> to carry out centralised checks of your systems; this includes the provision of any necessary electronic evidence that is required by the <abbr title="Performance and Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> to undertake the checks effectively.  <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will carry out these checks at the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>London</li>
  <li>Birmingham</li>
  <li>Sheffield</li>
  <li>Leeds</li>
  <li>Newcastle</li>
</ul>

<p>11.17. All issues arising from <abbr title="Performance and Compliance Officers">PCO</abbr> checks are reported to you, the Performance Management Team, Category Manager and Provider Assurance Team. Contract review meetings with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> Supplier Managers and Performance Managers will include discussions around compliance issues identified by PCOs.</p>

<p>11.18. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> reserves the right to carry out physical checks on documentation as part of this process.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit activity</h4>

<p>11.19. The <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Auditors will undertake regular checks on a sample of provider contracts to inspect that delivery complies with contractual obligations. They will check evidence to verify the eligibility of payments made in respect of a sample of individual participants. This will include evidence to support engagement activity and payment of any fee to meet <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> audit requirements.</p>

<h3>Assurance</h3>

<h4>Contract Management and Partner Delivery (CMPD) Provider Assurance Team</h4>

<p>11.20. The primary purpose of the Contract Management and Partnership Delivery Provider Assurance Team (<abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>) is to provide the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> CMPD Director with an assurance that supplier systems of internal control are such that payments made to suppliers are in accordance with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and Treasury requirements.</p>

<p>11.21. <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> reviews and tests providers’ systems of internal controls to establish how effective they are at managing risk to <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> in relation to CMPD expenditure and service delivery, including the arrangements they have.</p>

<p>11.22. This work is carried out by <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> by reviewing providers’ internal control systems to assess their ability to manage risk across 4 key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>governance arrangements: covering the provider’s governance arrangements, systems for tracking and reporting performance and their anti-fraud measures</li>
  <li>service delivery: includes the provider’s systems for starting, ending and moving participants through provision and generally looks to ensure that <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> is getting the service it is paying for. This section also covers management of the supply chain</li>
  <li>claim procedures and payments: looks to ensure that providers have in place effective systems to support their claims for payment, including appropriate segregation of duties</li>
</ul>

<p>11.23. The Provider Assurance Team operates at a national level enabling it to present CMPD Providers operating across regions with a single view of the effectiveness of their systems; each Provider will have a nominated Senior Provider Assurance Manager and therefore a single point of contact within <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> for management of assurance related issues/concerns.</p>

<p>11.24. On completion of each review, you are awarded an assurance rating from the following 	4 categories: weak, limited, reasonable and strong. You will also receive a formal report detailing the review findings including key strengths and areas for improvement; where weaknesses have been identified you are asked to complete an Action Plan setting out appropriate steps for improvement and this is followed up at an agreed point.</p>

<p>11.25. The timescale for a subsequent review is determined by several risk factors; these include the provider’s current assurance rating, the contract value and intelligence from internal stakeholders. Provider reviews are conducted over a period of up to 23 weeks. The resource allocated to each review depends on the complexity of the contract delivery.</p>

<p>11.26. Findings from each review are routinely reported to the relevant Category Managers or supplier managers and other <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> stakeholders. Remedial actions may be taken in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if following a weak or limited assurance level from the <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr>, the provider’s subsequent assurance level is the same or worse for the same reasons, or the provider is awarded a consecutive third weak or limited assurance, regardless of the reasons</li>
  <li>following a review, if the provider fails to submit or implement the Action Plan within the agreed timescale</li>
  <li>where there are suspicions that a provider may be acting inappropriately the team will refer to Internal Investigations as the experts trained in the legalities and techniques required to carry out formal investigations</li>
  <li>where there are serious concerns around data security these are reported through to the relevant <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> colleagues</li>
</ul>

<p>11.27. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> will periodically publish provider assurance levels and names (note: this will not include reports or supporting information). This is to satisfy a commitment <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> made in response to a Freedom of Information request and to support <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s commitment to public transparency.</p>

<p>11.28. The <abbr title="Provider Assurance Team">PAT</abbr> will work with you to ensure that you understand what is expected and are, therefore, adequately equipped to develop robust systems to support your service delivery model throughout the duration of the contract (for further information please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260423/pg-chapter-6.pdf">Chapter 6 of the Generic Provider Guide</a>).</p>

<h3>Scheme evaluation</h3>

<p>11.29. <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> may wish to undertake evaluation of the scheme, which may include one or both of in-house and externally commissioned research.</p>

<p>11.30. Researchers may wish to visit and interview you as part of the evaluation. You will be contacted in advance of any fieldwork. You are required to fully co-operate with scheme evaluation activity commissioned by <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Annex 1: Inappropriate referrals</h2>

<p>A1.01. Situations may arise where Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) make a referral which is inappropriate. In these cases and only these cases, there are processes to correct the error.</p>

<p>A1.02. When the error is discovered by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>, they will telephone your nominated contact to advise you what has happened. Upon receipt of this telephone call, you should take no further action with the participant until further instruction from Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>A1.03. You should advise the <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> and each Jobcentre with whom you work of your nominated contact person for these occurrences as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A1.04. If you discover an error with the referral, you should immediately contact your Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr>) at the Jobcentre concerned.</p>

<p>Note: You must not cancel or reject a referral before speaking to the <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr> as the decision as to whether the referral is incorrect lies with them.</p>

<h3>Ineligible referrals</h3>

<p>A1.05. There may be a small number of claimants referred to you who later turn out not to be eligible for <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>.</p>

<p>A1.06. <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will advise you accordingly and your subsequent actions will depend on the action you have already taken and the reason for the error. Below are some of the possible actions; however, you should be aware that where the error is through no fault of the claimant and they have started <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, then the referral will stand and the individual will be allowed to complete the provision.</p>

<p>Note: Where ineligible claimants are allowed to remain on provision, you must withdraw any completed <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14 20 paperwork as these claimants must not be used for any <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> 14 20 match. To do this you need to contact the <abbr title="European Social Fund">ESF</abbr> Admin team to arrange this.</p>

<p>A.1.07. Where the error is discovered and notified prior to Acknowledgement in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>, you are required to Acknowledge - Reject the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> recording a rejection reason of ‘Inappropriate Referral’.</p>

<p>A1.08. Where the error is discovered and notified after Acknowledgment but prior to the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> Start you must update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> in the ‘Orders’ tab selecting ‘Cancel – No Contact’ (This action will close the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and you are not required to take any further action in relation to the claimant).</p>

<p>A.1.09. Where the error is discovered and notified after the <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> start, <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> will advise the <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> who will arrange for the start to be ‘backed-out’ of <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr>. <abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr> will then email you when this action has been completed and you must then update <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> (within 24 hours) in the ‘Orders’ tab selecting ‘Cancel – No Contact’ (This action will close the referral in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payment system">PRaP</abbr> and you are not required to take any further action in relation to the claimant).</p>

<h3>If you discover the problem</h3>

<p>A1.10. If you believe there has been an error with the referral, you should immediately contact the appropriate <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr> at the Jobcentre concerned.</p>

<p>Note: You must not cancel or reject a referral before speaking to the <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr> as the decision as to whether the referral is incorrect lies with them.</p>

<h3>Duplicate referrals</h3>

<p>A1.11. There may be a small number of occasions where you receive a duplicate referral for a participant. It is your responsibility to check the referrals you receive to ensure that you only receive one referral per participant.</p>

<p>A1.12. If you receive duplicate referrals it is your responsibility to notify <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>. Any duplicate start fees that are paid will be recovered from you.</p>

<p>A1.13. Where the error is discovered you must continue to work with the participant.</p>

<h2>Annex 12: Universal Credit self-employed earnings</h2>

<p>The following is copied from information (UCFS5a) given to Universal Credit claimants who declare they are self-employed and shows what is required to be reported as earnings:</p>

<h3>What you need to report</h3>

<h3>Business income and allowed expenses</h3>

<h3>Business income</h3>

<p>You must report your income during your assessment period. This could include some of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any payments you actually received for goods and services. This can be by cash, cheque, credit or debit card, or bank transfer</li>
  <li>any goods or services you received for work carried out. You must report what you would usually have charged if the customer had paid for the work you did</li>
  <li>Income Tax or National Insurance contribution refunds made that relate to your self-employed earnings</li>
  <li>any grants or subsidies you received if they are treated by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> as taxable income</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are VAT registered you can choose to include or exclude VAT in the earnings you report, as you can for Income Tax self-assessment.</p>

<p>If you include VAT, you must include any VAT you charged your clients and any refunds of VAT to the business received in your total receipts.</p>

<p>If you do not do this, you must not include VAT paid to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> in your permitted expenses. You must be consistent with your choice of including or excluding VAT.</p>

<h3>Payments out of the business</h3>

<h3>Permitted expenses</h3>

<p>All permitted expenses must be reasonable. This means that they must be appropriate and necessary to the business, and not excessive.</p>

<p>Permitted expenses can include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular business costs such as rent or wages</li>
  <li>phone and travel costs</li>
  <li>VAT paid to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> (if you report VAT inclusive earnings as explained above)</li>
  <li>purchase of stock and equipment</li>
</ul>

<p>If you take out a loan or loans specifically for your business, you may deduct up to a total of £41 in each assessment period for interest repayments only.</p>

<h3>Flat rate deductions</h3>

<p>Some payments out must be reported as Flat Rate deductions. This includes all business expenses incurred for cars.</p>

<p>You can choose to report other payments as Flat Rate deductions. For example, where you incur expenses for a van or motorcycle or for using your home for business purposes.</p>

<p>See section B below for more details of Flat Rate deductions</p>

<h3>Other deductions</h3>

<h4>Income Tax</h4>

<p>This is the amount of Income Tax you have actually paid to <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> on your self-employed earnings during an assessment period.</p>

<p>You don’t need to estimate how much you owe for the month. If you haven’t actually paid any Income Tax in the assessment period, you should report £0.</p>

<h4>National Insurance contributions</h4>

<p>These are either Class 2 or Class 4 contributions for National Insurance that you have actually paid on your self-employment during an assessment period.</p>

<p>You don’t need to estimate how much you owe for the month. If you haven’t actually paid any National Insurance in the assessment period, you should report £0.</p>

<h4>Pension contributions</h4>

<p>These are paid into a registered pension scheme by or on behalf of a member of that scheme. They can be paid by an individual member, who must be a UK citizen, or by a third party for them.</p>

<h3>Types of allowable flat rate deductions</h3>

<p>If you choose to use flat rate deduction rather than deciding how much cost is due to your business, the following conditions and calculations apply.</p>

<h4>Car, van or other motor vehicles</h4>

<p>If you use a car (Including operating a mini-cab) for your business you must use only the following Flat Rate to report its running costs.</p>

<p>If you use a motorcycle, van or other motor vehicle designed mainly for business and not of a type commonly used for private use (such as a Black-cab), for your business you can choose either to:</p>

<p>•	include the actual costs of buying and running it in your permitted expenses 
•	use the following flat rates</p>

<h4>Flat rate for car, van or other motor vehicle</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>45 pence per mile for the first 833 miles in the assessment period</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 pence per mile for every mile over 833 miles in the assessment period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Flat rate for motorcycle</h4>

<ul>
  <li>24 pence per mile</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using your home for your business</h3>

<p>You may use part of your home for your self-employed business including, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing services to a customer, for example as a hairdresser</li>
  <li>
    <p>general business administration essential for the daily operation of the business, like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>filing invoices, recording receipts and payments</li>
      <li>stock taking</li>
      <li>sales and marketing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can deduct expenses for heating and lighting at the following flat rates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£10 for at least 25 hours, but no more than 50 hours</li>
  <li>£18 for more than 50 hours, but no more than 100 hours</li>
  <li>£26 for more than 100 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>You are not allowed to offset using your home for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>storage</li>
  <li>completing tax returns for <abbr title="Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
  <li>self-reporting your earnings for Universal Credit</li>
  <li>being on call</li>
  <li>being available to carry out work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal use of business premises</h3>

<p>If you mainly use your home for your business you can claim some of the running costs as permitted expenses. The amount you can claim depends on how many people share the premises.</p>

<p>To work out how much you can claim you must add up the total costs. Then you must reduce it by the following amounts in each assessment period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£350 for 1 person</li>
  <li>£500 for 2 people</li>
  <li>£650 for more than 2 people</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, Fred is self-employed and works from home as a music teacher. He uses the downstairs of the house as a music studio and lives upstairs. When reporting his income Fred says that he has expenses relating to the home of £800 in his most recent assessment period.</p>

<p>Fred shares his home with his civil partner, Andre. Andre is not involved in Fred’s business. Fred claims £800 in permitted expenses and reduces this amount by £500 as both he and Andre occupy the premises.</p>

<h3>Expenses not allowed to be deducted</h3>

<p>You are not allowed to claim the following expenses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expenditure on non-depreciating assets, including property, shares, or other assets held for investment</li>
  <li>any loss from a previous assessment period</li>
  <li>expenses for business entertainment</li>
  <li>capital repayments on a loan</li>
</ul>
