<p>This memo is for New Enterprise Allowance (<abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>) Providers.</p>

<p>Providers will need to close down a Provider Referrals and Payments (<abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr>) referral to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> for various reasons. Inappropriate referral should only be used in certain circumstances. If you think the referral is inappropriate you must contact your Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr>) in the Jobcentre, who will decide if the referral is inappropriate or not.</p>

<p>You must not cancel or reject these referrals before speaking to the <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr>.</p>

<p>Please follow Annex 1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-enterprise-allowance-phase-2-provider-guidance">provider guidance</a> for full details. <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-1">A1.01 – A1.04</a> are copied at the end of the memo for information.</p>

<p>Most closures are not to be classed as inappropriate, some of which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have a customer who decides they do not wish to participate in <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, or did not want to be referred to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr>, this needs to be cancelled as Did Not Start in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> – see para 3.10 (COVID instruction section) of the provider guidance</li>
  <li>if you cannot contact them via phone, text or e-mail this needs cancelling as Did Not Attend in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> – see para 4.04 of the provider guidance</li>
  <li>if after talking to the customer, you decide <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> is unsuitable for the customer or business idea you will need to cancel as Did Not start in <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> – see para 4.04 and para 7.15 of the provider guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Copy of Annex 1: Inappropriate Referrals</h2>

<p>A1.01. Situations may arise where Jobcentre Plus (<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>) make a referral which is inappropriate. In these cases, and only these cases, there are processes to correct the error.</p>

<p>A1.02. When the error is discovered by <abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr>, they will telephone your nominated contact to advise you what has happened. Upon receipt of this telephone call, you should take no further action with the participant until further instruction from Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<p>A1.03. You should advise the <abbr title="Provider Referrals and Payments">PRaP</abbr> Operational Support Team (<abbr title="PRaP Operational Support Team">POST</abbr>) and each Jobcentre with whom you work of your nominated contact person for these occurrences as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A1.04. If you discover an error with the referral, you should immediately contact your Single Point of Contact (<abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr>) at the Jobcentre concerned.</p>

<p>Note: You must not cancel or reject a referral before speaking to the <abbr title="Single Point of Contact">SPoC</abbr> as the decision as to whether the referral is incorrect lies with them.</p>
