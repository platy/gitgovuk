<abbr title="Jobcentre Plus">JCP</abbr> Work Coaches will refer eligible people to <abbr title="New Enterprise Allowance">NEA</abbr> by making a referral for an Initial Assessment (IA). There will be no requirement for the Work Coach to contact you by telephone whilst making the referral (sometimes referred to as a “warm handover”) but Work Coaches may contact you to discuss the referral where required. Prior to undertaking the IA, you will need to ensure that the Link Up: Start Up (<abbr title="Link Up: Start Up">LUSU</abbr>) information is shared with the claimant. This can be face to face, via telephone or using digital channels (or a combination of some or all of these). You must agree this with the claimant as to which is the best option for their circumstances. Any alternative to a face to face meeting would still need to be interactive and we would not expect, for example, for it to be just a matter of filling in a few questions on a form or answering a few questions on a telephone call. The face to face option must remain as one of the options available to the customer. As we return to Business as Usual, Providers will need to ensure latest Government guidance is followed on re-opening premises and offering face-to-face support.</td>
