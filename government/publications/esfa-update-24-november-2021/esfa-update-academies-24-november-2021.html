  <li>measuring the performance of your adult education budget, 16 to 18 traineeship (for providers without 16 to 19 funding) and 19 to 24 traineeship contract values as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2021-to-2022" class="govuk-link">adult education budget (AEB) funding rules 2021 to 2022</a>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: School and College security guidance</h2>

<p>Following the two confirmed terrorist incidents in the past month, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) have increased the national threat level from ‘Substantial’ to ‘Severe’. Whilst it should be noted that there is no credible threat to the education sector, education settings may wish to review their security policies following these incidents.</p>

<p>The non-statutory School and College Security Guidance includes a range of helpful security guidance and advice covering a range of security risks to help settings review their security policies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms</h2>

<p>On Friday 19 November the Department for Education published new statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms. The<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-school-uniforms"> new guidance is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>School uniform should never be a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education. This guidance means that schools will have a legal duty to take steps to keep uniform costs down.</p>

<p>The guidance requires schools to think holistically about the cost of their school uniform and so covers a range of issues including branded items, supplier arrangements, and second-hand uniform. The guidance also sets out when schools are expected to implement the changes required.</p>

<p>The Department has also updated the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform" class="govuk-link">wider non-statutory advice on developing and implementing a school uniform policy</a>.</p>

<p>The Department has also <a rel="external" href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2021/11/19/school-uniforms-what-you-need-to-know/" class="govuk-link">produced a resource aimed at parents to help explain some of the key changes</a>. Schools are invited to share this with their parents.</p>
