<span class="number">6. </span>Information: School and College security guidance</h2>

<p>Following the two confirmed terrorist incidents in the past month, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) have increased the national threat level from ‘Substantial’ to ‘Severe’. Whilst it should be noted that there is no credible threat to the education sector, education settings may wish to review their security policies following these incidents.</p>

<p>The non-statutory School and College Security Guidance includes a range of helpful security guidance and advice covering a range of security risks to help settings review their security policies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms</h2>

<p>On Friday 19 November the Department for Education published new statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms. The<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cost-of-school-uniforms" class="govuk-link"> new guidance is available on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>School uniform should never be a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education. This guidance means that schools will have a legal duty to take steps to keep uniform costs down.</p>

<p>The guidance requires schools to think holistically about the cost of their school uniform and so covers a range of issues including branded items, supplier arrangements, and second-hand uniform. The guidance also sets out when schools are expected to implement the changes required.</p>

<p>The Department has also updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform">wider non-statutory advice on developing and implementing a school uniform policy</a>.</p>

<p>The Department has also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2021/11/19/school-uniforms-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="external">produced a resource aimed at parents to help explain some of the key changes</a>. Schools are invited to share this with their parents.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: have your say in the The Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education’s (IfATE) stakeholder survey 2021</h2>

<p>IfATE’s short but sweet <a href="https://www.cognitoforms.com/InstituteForApprenticeships1/InstituteForApprenticeshipsAndTechnicalEducation2021StakeholderSurvey" class="govuk-link" rel="external">stakeholder survey for 2021 has launched</a>.</p>

<p>Each year the Institute runs this survey to get feedback about our work. The insights from this survey help us to plan future projects and gives us an understanding of our customers views.</p>

<p>Our 2021 survey has now opened (from 1 November)! We have worked hard to make sure the results will provide lots of useful feedback to inform our future work – but also prioritised ensuring it is quick and easy to complete.</p>

<p>The survey is open until 11.59pm on 12 December and will take no more than 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting us with this. We wouldn’t be able to do our work without your help and insights.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the survey or trouble completing it, please email <a href="mailto:enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk</a> for support.</p>
