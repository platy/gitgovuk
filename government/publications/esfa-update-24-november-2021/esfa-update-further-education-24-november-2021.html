<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: remember to order new devices via the get help with technology service</h2>

<p>Back in October, the department announced the provision of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-leavers-and-disadvantaged-pupils-to-benefit-from-126-million-investment-in-new-laptops-and-tablets" class="govuk-link">further 500,000 laptops and tablets</a>, via the Get help with technology service, so that disadvantaged children and young people can access remote education and social care services. </p>

<p>We have now invited all organisations with an allocation to order. We sent instructions about how to order to the email addresses provided in the Get help with technology service. If you have not received this, please check your junk and spam folders before contacting us.</p>

<p>If your preferred device types are in stock, you should order as soon as possible to avoid disappointment. </p>

<p>You can now also apply for devices for children and young people who have joined your school or college under Operation Warm Welcome.</p>

<p>Up to 6,000 devices are available for children and young people in UK school years 3 to 13, brought to England under Operation Warm Welcome, via the Get help with technology service. </p>

<p>If you need to order devices for these children and young people, please sign into the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/">Get help with technology service</a> and follow our Operation Warm Welcome guidance.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: National Skills Fund</h2>

<p>As announced at Spending Review, the Government is investing £1.6 billion through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-skills-fund#free-level-3-qualifications-for-adults">National Skills Fund</a> in the next three years, on top of the £375 million investment in financial year 2021-2022. This includes extending the eligibility for Free Courses for Jobs (level 3) offer to more adults and further expanding Skills Bootcamps.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Free Courses for Jobs (referred to in existing funding rules as the Level 3 Adult offer)</h3>

<p>The Free Courses for Jobs offer, which was launched in April 2021, gives eligible adults the chance to access their first Level 3 qualifications for free. In addition, from April next year any adult in England who is earning under the National Living Wage or is unemployed will also be able to access these qualifications for free, regardless of their prior qualification level.</p>

<p>We have also updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-a-free-level-3-qualification/list-of-free-level-3-qualifications-available-to-eligible-adults">list of free level 3 qualifications</a> available under the Free Courses for Jobs offer. We have added 23 qualifications to the offer, as part of our commitment to keep the list under review and to receive suggestions for inclusion by awarding bodies, Mayoral Combined Authorities and the Greater London Authority. These qualifications met the published criteria for inclusion in the Free Courses for Jobs qualifications list.</p>

<p>4 qualifications that were previously included in the offer are no longer publicly funded or are no longer offered by the awarding organisations. These 4 qualifications will therefore be unavailable through the Free Courses for Jobs offer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Skills Bootcamps</h3>

<p>In September, we announced an investment of up to £17m to deliver new Skills Bootcamps to help up to 5,000 adults to train as HGV drivers.</p>

<p>We are pleased with the huge interest from providers and employers across the country in the recent procurement exercise to deliver these new Skills Bootcamps in HGV driving. We received many high-quality bids, and we will announce the successful suppliers in December. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/find-a-skills-bootcamp">full list of Skills Bootcamps</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Each year the Institute runs this survey to get feedback about our work. The insights from this survey help us to plan future projects and gives us an understanding of our customers views.</p>

<p>Our 2021 survey has now opened (from 1 November)! We have worked hard to make sure the results will provide lots of useful feedback to inform our future work – but also prioritised ensuring it is quick and easy to complete.</p>

<p>The survey is open until 11.59pm on 12 December and will take no more than 5 to 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting us with this. We wouldn’t be able to do our work without your help and insights.</p>
