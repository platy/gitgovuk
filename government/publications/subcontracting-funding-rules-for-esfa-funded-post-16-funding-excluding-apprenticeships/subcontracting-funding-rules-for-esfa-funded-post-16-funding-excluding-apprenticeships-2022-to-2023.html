<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>From the date of publication of these rules to the commencement of the 2022 to 2023 funding year we will continue our reforms to strengthen ESFA’s oversight of the approach to subcontracting in the sector.</p>

<p>Our aims are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strengthen our monitoring and improve our assessment of risk to identify problems earlier</li>
  <li>intervene more quickly and decisively</li>
  <li>harmonise and clarify the rules and requirements across post-16 funding streams</li>
  <li>reduce the overall volume of subcontracted activity in the sector</li>
  <li>eliminate subcontracting that is undertaken for purely financial reasons</li>
  <li>retain subcontracting that meets niche or specialised needs, improves access and provides opportunities for disadvantaged learners</li>
</ul>

<p>These aims will assist in mitigating the risk of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inadequate (contract) management of subcontractors</li>
  <li>non-compliance with ESFA funding rules by subcontractors</li>
  <li>fraudulent and incorrect funding claims</li>
</ul>

<p>From the 2022 to 2023 funding year onwards subcontracting in any given funding stream may only be up to 25% of that funding stream unless the express permission of ESFA has been sought and granted via an exemption case. ESF and LA’s are exempt from this rule.</p>

<p>We have been clear from the outset that we wish to see a significant reduction in the overall volume of subcontracted delivery in the sector. To this end during the autumn 2020 term all providers were asked to produce a plan to reduce the amount of subcontracting in order to meet the 25% cap by the 2022 to 2023 funding year and each subsequent funding year thereafter.</p>

<p>Where a provider does not think it can make a reduction, it should have submitted an exemption case.
These reforms have been put in place to ensure learners receive the best possible education and training and to enable ESFA to have oversight of the use of public funds, ensuring these are spent appropriately, providing value for money.</p>

<p>There are instances where a specific rule, or subsection of a rule is only applicable to a specific funding stream. Where this is the case, we have developed a series of annexes applicable to each individual funding stream. The annexes should be referred to in the context of that specific individual funding stream. Common terminology has been adopted across all funding streams; a glossary of terms has been included at the end of this document.
Although this document represents a comprehensive set of subcontracting funding rules across the AEB, ESF and 16 to 19 funding streams it should be viewed in context of the wider funding rules for each individual funding stream. These rules form part of a series of documents that are relevant to subcontracting and subcontractors. Providers should also familiarise themselves with the requirements in relation to subcontracting in ESFA Education and skills conditions of funding and/or Education and skills contracts for services.</p>

<p>Providers must ensure they are compliant with all relevant funding rules, these are available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Your policies for subcontracting and fees and charges</h2>

<p>1: In accordance with the provisions of each contract/agreement you have with ESFA, your published policy for subcontracting must include the following.</p>

<p>1.1: The rationale for subcontracting the provision. The subcontracting must enhance the quality of your learner offer. You must not subcontract delivery to meet short-term funding objectives.</p>

<p>2: We expect the rationale to meet one or more of the following aims:</p>

<p>2.1: Enhance the opportunities available to learners.</p>

<p>2.2: Fill gaps in niche or expert provision or provide better access to facilities.</p>

<p>2.3: Support better geographical access for learners.</p>

<p>2.4: Support an entry point for disadvantaged groups.</p>

<p>2.5: Support individuals who share protected characteristics, where there might otherwise be gaps.</p>

<p>3: You must also set out your full range of fees retained and charges that apply including:</p>

<p>3.1: Funding retained for quality assurance and oversight.
  3.2: Funding retained for administrative functions such as data returns. 
  3.3: Funding retained for mandatory training delivered to subcontractor staff by the directly funded provided. 
  3.4: Clawback for under delivery or other reasons. 
  3.5:How you will determine that each cost claimed by a subcontractor is reasonable and proportionate to the delivery of their teaching or learning and how each cost contributes to delivering high quality learning.</p>

<p>4: Your governing body or board of directors and your accounting officer (senior responsible person) must agree your policy for delivery subcontracting.</p>

<p>5: ESFA will reserve the right to require an explanation where the funding you have retained as your management fee for a subcontract exceeds 20% of the overall contract but offers little value.</p>

<p>6: We expect these policies, including the rationale, to be reviewed by you ahead of each funding year, and signed off by those charged with overall responsibility for your organisation in your governance structure. Once reviewed, the updated policy must be published by 31 October each year.</p>

<p>7: You must only use subcontractors for delivery of the provision if:</p>

<p>7.1: You have staff with, the knowledge, skills, and experience (for example, with 6 appropriate qualifications or experience, as evidenced by their CVs) within your organisation to:</p>

<p>7.2: Successfully select subcontractors in line with the requirements of these funding rules and your contract with ESFA, and</p>

<p>7.3: Contract with and actively manage those subcontractors.</p>

<p>7.4: Those charged with governance/board of directors and your accounting officer (senior responsible person) determine the subcontractors as being of high quality and low risk to public funds.</p>

<p>7.5: You have robust procedures in place to ensure subcontracting does not lead to ensure subcontracting does not lead to the inadvertent funding of extremist organisations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Selection and procurement of your subcontractors</h2>

<p>8: In accordance with your contract(s)/agreement(s) with ESFA you must notify <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subcontracting.requirements@education.gov.uk">subcontracting.requirements@education.gov.uk</a> about any circumstances which might lead to an actual or perceived conflict of interest. For example, where your organisation and your proposed subcontractor have directors or beneficial owners in common. You must:</p>

<p>8.1: Not award the contract without our written permission.</p>

<p>8.2: Keep as evidence both your request and our reply.</p>

<p>9: You must not subcontract, without written ESFA permission, to any institution or organisation which is not permitted to recruit 16 to 18 year old students and/or 19 to 25 year old high needs students (HNS), for example an 11 to 16 school.</p>

<p>10: You must ensure that you comply with current and relevant procurement regulations. If you are a contracting authority, this means that you must comply with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”). You must ensure that you select your subcontractor(s) fairly transparently and without discrimination and that you ensure that potential subcontractors have sufficient capacity, quality and business standing to deliver the provision that is being subcontracted.</p>

<p>11: If your organisation is a contracting authority as defined by the 2015 Regulations, you must comply with the provisions of the 2015 Regulations when selecting and awarding service delivery to a subcontractor. Each organisation must make its own determination about whether it is a contracting authority or not, taking legal advice, as necessary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Due diligence requirements</h2>

<p>12: In any event you must carry out your own thorough due diligence checks when appointing delivery subcontractors and ensure that you continue to undertake and review these checks on an annual/ongoing basis with each of your delivery subcontractors. As a minimum, you must undertake the checks identified in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>13: You must review the circumstances and criteria in the funding higher risk organisations and subcontractors’ policy (hereafter referred to as “funding higher risk organisations policy”) in which ESFA would consider a provider (including subcontractors) to be a high-risk provider and as a result will not consider funding or agree applications and/or bids for funding from them.</p>

<p>14: Due diligence checks on subcontractors must apply the criteria in the funding higher risk organisations policy setting out when a provider is high risk and therefore not eligible to be appointed as a subcontractor.</p>

<p>15: Your contract with any subcontractors should enable your organisation to take appropriate action in line with the funding higher risk organisations policy, not only if your organisation deems it is necessary, but also where ESFA requires you to take appropriate action.</p>

<p>16: You must also ensure any subcontractor has the financial ability to deliver the requirements of the subcontract. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-financial-health-assessment/financial-health-guidance-for-organisations-contracting-with-or-applying-to-esfa">This information provides help for you to undertake a financial assessment of the subcontractor</a>.</p>

<p>17: You must not contract with brand new companies who are yet to submit their first statutory accounts, unless they are able to thoroughly verify the new company’s financial capability.</p>

<p>18: You must consider the subcontractors credit rating. Where this is above average, you should assure yourself that the subcontractor is available to deliver the needs to the contract, and you are able to manage the risks.</p>

<p>19: You must not award or renew a subcontract to any organisation if:</p>

<p>19.1: It has passed a resolution (or the court has made an order) to wind up or liquidate the company, or administrators have been appointed.
  19.2: Its statutory accounts are overdue.</p>

<p>20: If a subcontractor does not meet, or continue to meet, the minimum due diligence and financial health checks required (paragraph 12 to 18 above), you must suspend the right of the subcontractor to recruit new learners. Depending on the circumstances you may be required by ESFA to terminate the subcontract if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>21: You should refer to the list of declared subcontractors to determine if a subcontractor that you intend to use or are using already holds subcontracts with other organisations.</p>

<p>22: For subcontractors in receipt of an aggregate subcontract value of ESFA funding for delivering education and training that totals £100,000 or more for each funding year, or where the subcontract from you would take the total value of such subcontracts to £100,000 or more, you must share the results of your checks with ESFA via a signed return on the template ESFA will provide by the dates provided to you. ESFA will then undertake internal high-risk checks to determine if the subcontractor falls in scope of the Funding higher risk organisations policy. If they do, you may be required to end your subcontract with that organisation, and we may restrict your future use of subcontractors.</p>

<p>23: Where a subcontractor has a subcontract valued at £500,000 or greater in any funding year, ESFA will carry out additional financial health checks directly with the subcontractor, in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-financial-health-assessment/financial-health-guidance-for-organisations-contracting-with-or-applying-to-esfa">financial health guidance for organisations contracting with or applying to ESFA</a>. You will be required to supply ESFA with the relevant documents. If the subcontractor fails ESFA financial health checks, you will be unable to take on any new subcontracted starts with the subcontractor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Entering into a subcontract</h3>

<p>24: You must not make artificial distinctions or distortions when describing delivery arrangements in order to avoid the application of these rules.</p>

<p>25: If you have not previously subcontracted provision we fund, you must get our written approval before awarding a contract to a delivery subcontractor and keep evidence of the written approval. See ESFA guidance document “<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/subcontracting-esfa-post-16-education-and-training-for-the-first-time">Subcontracting for the First Time – Seeking Written Approval from the Education and Skills Funding Agency</a>”.</p>

<p>26: In accordance with your ESFA agreement you must not enter into any agreement for brokerage.</p>

<p>27: You must only award subcontracts for delivery of ESFA funded provision to legal entities. If the legal entity is a registered company, it must be recorded as ‘active’ on the Companies House database. Subcontractors must register on the UK Register of Learning Providers (UKRLP) and hold a valid UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) to be eligible to receive funding from us, either directly or through a subcontracting arrangement.</p>

<p>28: You must not agree the use of any subcontractor where this would require you to effectively subcontract ESFA funding to a second level of subcontractor. In other words, all subcontractors must have a direct subcontract with your organisation. You may have more than one subcontractor, but each subcontractor must have a direct subcontract with you. The restriction on the level of subcontracting is in place to ensure that:</p>

<p>28.1: Lead providers retain clear and transparent accountability for the quality of training provision.</p>

<p>28.2: Proper and appropriate controls are in place to manage the learner experience.</p>

<p>28.3: Value for money is achieved by mitigating funding being utilised for multiple tiers of subcontractor management.</p>

<p>29: You must make sure that learners supported through subcontracting arrangements know about you and your subcontractors roles and responsibilities in providing the learning.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Subcontracting threshold and exemption cases (please note, this does not apply to ESF provision or local authorities)</h2>

<p>30: As set out in the contract, if you subcontract more than 25% of the learners (based on ILR data) for AEB or 16 to 19, you must submit an exemption case to ESFA to obtain ESFA’s agreement by 31 March in each funding year. This policy is in place as part of the subcontracting reforms which had the overarching aim of reducing the volume of subcontracting in the sector to ensure high quality provision for learners and as much funding reaching the front line as possible.</p>

<p>31: You must submit the exemption case in writing to ESFA as soon as possible utilising Annex C of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-details-about-reforms-to-subcontracting-education-for-learners-over-16">Reforms to subcontracting education for learners over 16</a>.</p>

<p>32: The exemption case should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:subcontracting.requirements@education.gov.uk">subcontracting.requirements@education.gov.uk</a>. In your exemption case, we need you to supply the following information about your proposed subcontracting arrangement.</p>

<p>32.1: The full legal name and UKPRN of your proposed subcontractor(s).</p>

<p>32.2: The elements of delivery you would like to subcontract.</p>

<p>32.3: Value of the subcontract(s), number of learners and the last planned end date of the provision that would be delivered under a subcontract (if you are already have one or more subcontracts in place).</p>

<p>32.4: What the educational rationale is for putting these subcontracting arrangements in place. Your statement in relation to this must be supported by your officers that are charged with governance. For further details on the role of those charged with governance please see Annex A of Reforms to subcontracting education for learners over 16</p>

<p>32.5: To what extent you are involved in delivery as the lead provider.</p>

<p>32.6: What amount of funding is retained by you, the lead provider to cover the costs incurred in management of the subcontract, and how you use these costs to ensure the subcontractor delivers high quality learning.</p>

<p>32.7: To what extent a gap has been identified by a local authority or employer which the subcontractor is filling.</p>

<p>32.8: To what extent does the learner engage with the lead provider.</p>

<p>32.9: What your oversight arrangements are in relation to the delivery of the subcontracted provision.</p>

<p>33: We will consider your request, taking into account the detail you have provided, data and information available within and outside ESFA. We will consider:</p>

<p>33.1: Your subcontracting policy, including your fees and charges policy, and whether this has been signed off by your officers who are charged with governance in line with rule 1.</p>

<p>33.2: If you subcontract more than £100,000 in a funding year, we will consider the external auditor’s report on the effectiveness of the processes and controls you have in place for managing subcontractors as set out in rule 44.</p>

<p>33.3: We reserve the right to decline your request, if we do decline it, we will explain why we are declining it. If we decline your request, you must take steps to reduce your subcontracting in any given funding stream to less than 25% by the next funding year.</p>

<p>33.4: Whether the subcontracting is delivering to learners who may not otherwise have access to provision, including there being no alternative provision or the characteristics of the learner mean another lead provider may not be suitable.</p>

<p>34: If you do not currently subcontract more than 25%, you are still required to review all subcontracted provision in line with rule 2. You should ensure you review this, on at least an annual basis, the educational rationale for entering each subcontract and ensure these remain relevant and are supported by your officers who are charged with governance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Monitoring of your subcontractors and subcontracted provision</h2>

<p>52: You are responsible for the actions of your subcontractors connected to, or arising out of, the delivery of the services, which you subcontract. If your subcontractor fails to deliver, you will be responsible for making alternative arrangements for the delivery of education and training, protecting the audit trail, and/or repaying ESFA or ESF funding.</p>

<p>53: You must manage and monitor all your subcontractors to ensure that high-quality delivery is taking place that meets the requirements of the contract you have entered into with ESFA for the provision of ESFA funded delivery (which includes compliance with ESFA funding rules). You must ensure safeguarding is rigorously policed.</p>

<p>54: It is not acceptable for any staff with a direct or indirect financial interest in the subcontractor to undertake any management control activities This includes signing time sheets or invoices, as well as organising and/or carrying out monitoring activity or visits to check the subcontractor delivery.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Subcontracting reporting and external audit requirements</h2>

<p>57: You must record subcontracted provision in line with the published guidance for the school census and the individualised learner record (ILR) data returns.</p>

<p>58: If you return ILR data, in accordance with your ESFA contract (s) you must submit a fully completed subcontractor declaration by the dates given to you by ESFA. This will be at least twice during the funding year. If you do not subcontract you must still provide a nil return to confirm this.</p>

<p>59: You must also update your subcontractor declaration if your subcontracting arrangements change during the year. This is done via your MyESF account.</p>

<p>60: In accordance with your ESFA contract(s), you must meet ESFA subcontracting standard as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1007581/subcontracting_standard_guidance.pdf" rel="external">subcontracting standard guidance</a>, [The Auditors guidance is currently in development and an update will follow], if the aggregate total of all subcontractors delivering ESFA funded provision on your behalf exceeds or is anticipated to exceed £100,000 in any single funding year. Whilst otherwise excluded from these rules, for the purposes of calculation of aggregate total of subcontractor delivery you must include delivery of apprenticeships.</p>

<p>61: You must supply us with both a report and certificate signed by an external auditor that provides assurance on the arrangements to manage and control your delivery subcontractors. You must send a copy of the external auditor’s final report including the action plan of agreed recommendations and certificate via ESFA Document Exchange by 31 of July 2023. Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange/user-guide" rel="external">Document Exchange user guide</a>. ESFA will review this as part of our overall assurance arrangements.</p>

<p>62: Templates of the certificate you must return, as well as guidance and information on expectations can be found on GOV.UK webpage <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providing-external-assurance-on-subcontracting-controls/providing-external-assurance-on-subcontracting-controls">providing external assurance on subcontracting controls</a>. This also gives guidance on how we ESFA will use this information and the consequences of non-compliance.</p>

<p>63: If ESFA does not receive the auditor’s report on the subcontracting standard by 31 July 2023, you as the lead provider will be deemed as non-compliant if no subcontracting report on the subcontractor is provided by this date and funding may be affected/delayed.</p>

<h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Entering into a subcontract</h3>

<span class="number">10. </span>16 to 19 Annex</h2>

<p>71: For the avoidance of doubt, all ESFA funded provision, including enrichment, employment and pastoral (EEP) activity is a funded part of a study programme or T Level. Where the funded provider pays a third party to deliver such activity they are deemed to be a subcontractor. This arrangement is subject to meeting our subcontracting controls guidance, and the third party should be included in the subcontracting declaration made by the lead provider.</p>

<p>72: Where T Level providers are passing T Level Industry Placement Employer Incentive payments on to employers (a short term incentive available during the 2021 to 2022 academic year only), they must complete and upload the employer declaration to the digital tool capturing this information, but do not need to also account for these in the subcontractor declaration.

<p>74: You must be able to demonstrate that you exercise all the following key controls:</p>

<p>74.1: You can enrol or reject learners as you would do if the learners were to be taught on your own site.</p>

<p>74.2: Learners sign a learning agreement at the time of enrolment; the agreement must reflect the outcome of initial guidance and assessment for an individual student and set out their study programme and any learning support to be provided.</p>

<p>75: You must establish whether any of your subcontractors work with other directly funded ESFA lead providers.</p>

<p>76: You must make sure that you are the only provider that is claiming ESFA funding for the learners that you are claiming funding for. Learners must not be enrolled at more than one directly funded ESFA provider.</p>

<p>77: You, as the lead provider must claim all the funding for an ESFA-funded learner. When a learner is attending different directly funded providers for different components of their programme of study, the lead provider must record all these components and indicate on the individualised learner record or school census which elements are delivered via a subcontracting arrangement.</p>

<p>78: All individual students must have the correct unique learner number recorded.</p>

<p>79: An exception to rules B.4 and B.5 is where a learner is enrolled on a Diploma in Sporting Excellence in addition to their main study programme.</p>

<span class="number">10.4 </span>Distance subcontracted delivery</h3>

<p>80: Only in exceptional circumstances should institutions make subcontracting arrangements for delivery outside their normal recruitment area. (‘normal recruitment area’ is defined in the funding regulations guidance).</p>

<p>81: You must seek approval to continue with or embark on new arrangements for distance subcontracting. Further details about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-details-about-reforms-to-subcontracting-education-for-learners-over-16">reforms to subcontracting education for learners over 16</a> including what to include in the request and where to send it is available. We expect to receive this at least 6 months prior to the start of delivery for any new requests. Approval to continue with existing arrangements should be sent to ESFA no later than 31 March each funding year. We will only consider late requests where there is evidence of exceptional circumstances</p>

<p>82: Where you do enter into distance subcontracting relationships, you must exercise the same level of management, control, safeguarding of learners and assure yourself you still meet all necessary rules.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span>Whole programme subcontracting and restrictions for schools and academies</h3>

<p>83: You must seek approval to continue with or embark on new arrangements for whole programme subcontracting. Further details about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-details-about-reforms-to-subcontracting-education-for-learners-over-16">reforms to subcontracting education for learners over 16</a> including what to include in the request and where to send it. We expect to receive this at least 6 months prior to the start of delivery for any new requests. Approval to continue with existing arrangements should be sent to ESFA no later than 31 March each funding year. We will only consider late requests where there is evidence of exceptional circumstances</p>

<p>84: Schools and academies must not subcontract whole study programmes under any circumstances. Legally, being a pupil and attending a school are based on physical presence. Although schools have powers to arrange some educational activities away from their premises, these are not intended to allow the whole of a pupil’s education to be delivered somewhere, and by someone, other than the school. Schools and academies can therefore only subcontract provision for learners who:</p>

<p>84.1: Attend the institution for at least one element of their programme throughout the academic year.</p>

<p>84.2: Attend the school or academy at least once a week.</p>

<p>85: You must not enter into subcontracting arrangements with special schools for the whole, or for a substantial proportion of a students’ programme where they are aged 19 to 25. Special schools have the option to set up a legally and financially separate entity to make provision for 19- to 25-year-olds as advised in the high needs funding: operational guide.</p>

<p>86: When a subcontractor wants to appoint and work with a third party, which could include a sports club, it is you as the provider who must have a direct contractual relationship with the third party and not the subcontractor. Third parties must not be appointed or managed by the subcontractor. There must be no financial transactions between a subcontractor and a third party. You must take steps to assure yourself that the third party has:</p>

<p>86.1: Facilities that are safe, suitable, and fit for purpose.</p>

<p>86.2: Safeguarding arrangements that are robust and reviewed regularly, at least on an annual basis.</p>

<p>87: You must take appropriate steps to ensure that both you and the sports club are clear on what activities are suitable for ESFA funding and what activities are not suitable for ESFA funding.</p>
