<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This instruction provides guidance to decision-makers on the duration of and conditions attached to permission to stay, previously referred to as leave to remain, to be granted to those who have been granted refugee status or humanitarian protection under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Part 11 of the Immigration Rules</a>. This includes those granted at initial decision stage or following an allowed appeal. This guidance only applies to decisions on asylum applications made on or after 28 June 2022.</p>

<h3>Contacts</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about the guidance and your line manager or senior caseworker cannot help you or you think that the guidance has factual errors then email the Asylum Policy team.</p>

<p>If you notice any formatting errors in this guidance (broken links, spelling mistakes and so on) or have any comments about the layout or navigability of the guidance then you can email the Guidance Rules and Forms team.</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was cleared:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 1.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 28 June 2022</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This is new guidance.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Relevance of the date that the asylum claim was made</h3>

<p>This guidance is version 1.0 and it explains the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for you to grant refugee permission to stay, temporary permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay.</p>

<p>This guidance is for decision-makers considering asylum claims lodged on or after 28 June 2022 or asylum claims that need to be considered as if they had claimed asylum before 28 June 2022 under transitional arrangements.</p>

<p>28 June 2022 is the ‘commencement date’ for the relevant sections of the</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/contents/enacted" rel="external">Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (‘2022 Act’)</a> and the associated changes to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Part 11 of the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<p>For asylum claims lodged before this date, please see refugee and humanitarian protection leave.</p>

<h3>Transitional arrangements</h3>

<p>For the purposes of the transitional arrangements only, individuals who sought to register an asylum claim before the commencement date of 28 June 2022 but were provided with an appointment to attend a designated place to register their asylum application on or after 28 June will be considered to have ‘made an asylum claim’ before the commencement date but only if they attend their scheduled appointment (or, in the event that it is cancelled or rescheduled by the Home Office, the rescheduled appointment). Therefore, for this cohort, this policy does not apply and instead, you should refer to the guidance on refugee and humanitarian protection leave.</p>

<p>However, if the individual does not attend their appointment, but later wishes to register a claim for asylum on or after commencement, they will not be considered to have ‘made an asylum claim’ unless (a) there were circumstances beyond their control that made it impossible for them to attend the appointment scheduled for them, (b) they contacted the Home Office as soon as reasonably practicable to warn/explain of the said circumstances and apply for a new appointment and (c) they provided the Home Office, as soon as reasonably practicable, with evidence to demonstrate their inability to attend the scheduled appointment which they say they were unable to attend. In such cases, this guidance will apply to their claim.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The UK has a proud record of providing protection for those who need it, in accordance with our international obligations, for example under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’). Those recognised as refugees because they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin for reasons covered by the Refugee Convention are normally granted refugee status and a period of limited permission to stay in the UK. Those recognised as facing a real risk of serious harm in their country of origin are normally granted humanitarian protection and a period of limited permission to stay in the UK.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/contents/enacted" rel="external">2022 Act</a> introduced two groups of refugees; each group may be provided with a different form of permission to stay. This policy applies to individuals granted refugee status following asylum applications made on or after 28 June 2022.</p>

<p>An individual granted refugee status will either be granted refugee permission to stay or temporary refugee permission to stay as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraph 352G of the Immigration Rules</a>. The type of permission to stay granted is dependent on whether the claimant meets the criteria in Section 12 of the 2022 Act.</p>

<p>If an individual with refugee status meets both the requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12(2)</a> and, where applicable, the additional requirement set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12(3) of the 2022 Act</a>, then they are a Group 1 refugee, and as such will be granted refugee permission to stay. Refugee permission to stay will normally last for 5 years and will include the right to work, recourse to public funds and access to family reunion. They will also be eligible to apply for settlement on a protection route (also referred to as ‘settlement protection’) after having refugee permission to stay for 5 years – see the settlement protection guidance.</p>

<p>If an individual with refugee status fails to meet the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12(2) and (3) of the 2022 Act</a>, then they are a Group 2 refugee, and will be granted temporary refugee permission to stay as a result. Upon commencement, temporary refugee permission to stay will normally last for 30 months and may include the right to work, recourse to public funds and family reunion rights limited to that which meet the threshold of Article 8 of the ECHR. The conditions attached to temporary refugee permission to stay may change at a later point. A recipient of temporary refugee permission to stay will be able to apply for further permission to stay after 30 months. As part of consideration of each application for further permission to stay, the decision-maker will assess whether there is a continuing need for protection in the UK via a safe return review (for more guidance on safe returns reviews, see the settlement protection guidance). A recipient of temporary refugee permission to stay may apply for settlement on the 10-year long residency route.</p>

<p>The decision-maker may utilise the screening interview, substantive interview (where one has been conducted), and any other information available - for example case notes from Border Force or a Preliminary Interview Questionnaire - to determine which group a refugee falls into. Where the decision-maker decides the refugee falls into Group 2, then the refugee will be given an opportunity to rebut this finding. After which, the decision-maker will make a final decision as to whether the refugee should be granted refugee permission to stay (Group 1) or temporary permission to stay (Group 2). Thereafter, the decision will be implemented. For more guidance on the process, see the ‘rebuttal process’ section of the assessing credibility and refugee status in asylum claims lodged on or after 28 June 2022 guidance.</p>

<p>An individual granted humanitarian protection will be granted temporary humanitarian permission to stay. There is only one form of permission to stay for individuals with humanitarian protection. This will normally last for 30 months and the conditions are identical to temporary refugee permission to stay. The conditions attached to temporary humanitarian permission to stay may change at a later point.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Policy intention</h3>

<p>The policy objective is primarily to provide a period of permission to stay in the UK to those with protection status because they cannot be expected to leave the UK. The policy is designed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meet our international obligations under the Refugee Convention by granting refugee status and an appropriate period of permission to stay to those who need our protection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet our international obligations under the ECHR by granting humanitarian protection and an appropriate period of permission to stay to those who cannot be expected leave the UK as in doing so they would face a real risk of serious harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain a fair immigration system that requires all migrants, including those granted protection status, to complete an appropriate period of limited permission to stay in order to be granted the right to settlement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that safe return reviews are carried out when considering applications for further permission to stay on a protection route so that protection is provided for as long as it is needed, but make clear that those who no longer need protection will need to apply to stay on another basis or leave the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain a firm immigration system that imposes differentiated conditions on refugees who do not meet the requirements set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">section 12(2) and (3) of the 2022 Act</a>, including but not limited to length of permission, route to settlement, family reunion, and recourse to public funds</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Application in respect of children</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" rel="external">Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009</a> requires the Home Office to ensure that immigration and nationality functions are discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the UK. This applies to children who claim asylum in their own right and those dependent on their parents’ asylum claim.</p>

<p>Those who are granted protection status are normally granted permission to stay for 30 months or 5 years and any children who are under 18 and dependent on the asylum claim will be granted permission to stay in line with the main claimant (if they do not have protection needs in their own right).</p>

<p>Unaccompanied children who claim asylum and qualify for refugee status or humanitarian protection are also normally granted in-line with this policy. However, there may also be exceptional reasons to grant a longer period of permission to stay and you should refer to the section on applications for longer periods of permission to stay below.</p>

<p>You must carefully consider any evidence provided as to how a child will be affected by a grant of limited permission to stay rather than immediate settlement. In the vast majority of cases, we anticipate the impact will not be significant because limited permission to stay provides appropriate protection in accordance with our international obligations and access to benefits and services that a child may require. It is therefore very unlikely that best interests considerations in an individual case will override the wider policy intention to require all individuals to complete an appropriate period of permission to stay before being able to apply for settlement.</p>

<p>Although a child’s best interests are not a factor in assessing which form of permission to stay to grant to them or their parents, you must have regard to the section 55 duty in considering whether other leave may be appropriate following such action. The statutory guidance, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257876/change-for-children.pdf">Every Child Matters – Change for Children</a>, sets out the key principles to take into account in all actions.</p>

<p>Where there are child welfare or protection concerns that may involve safeguarding issues within the family unit, the case must be referred immediately to the Asylum Safeguarding Hub who will refer the case to the relevant local authority. There is no requirement to obtain the consent of any adults involved as safeguarding the child is our primary responsibility. In an emergency the case must be referred to the police without delay. The Safeguarding Advice and Children’s Champion (SACC) can also offer specialist safeguarding and welfare advice on issues relating to children, including family court proceedings and complex child protection cases.</p>

<p>For further information on the key principles to take into account, see: Section 55 children’s duty guidance. See also Processing asylum applications from children guidance.</p>

<h2>Legislation</h2>

<h3>The 1951 Refugee Convention</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html" rel="external">Refugee Convention</a> provides the framework for international refugee protection. Under the Convention, signatory states have obligations to refugees which include protection against non-refoulement, but also extend to other rights including freedom of religion, access to justice, education, employment, housing, public relief and the facilitation of integration and naturalisation in the host country. The UK implements its obligations to refugees, including furnishing them with their rights under the Convention, through domestic legislation which sets out refugees’ permission to stay and associated entitlements.</p>

<h3>Immigration Rules</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-rules-part-11">Part 11 of the Immigration Rules</a> sets out the provisions for considering asylum applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Paragraph 334</a> sets out the criteria that must be met for an individual to be granted refugee status</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Paragraph 339Q</a>A-C sets out the conditions for granting permission to stay to individuals with refugee status or humanitarian protection, and their dependants</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-rules-part-11">Part 11 of the Immigration Rules</a> also sets out the provisions for considering humanitarian protection. Humanitarian protection is considered where an asylum applicant does not qualify for refugee status. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Paragraph 339C</a> sets out the criteria that must be met for an individual to be granted humanitarian protection; this includes a requirement for the applicant facing a real risk of suffering serious harm upon return to their country of origin. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-rules-part-11">Paragraph 339QB</a> outlines that recipients of humanitarian protection will be granted temporary humanitarian permission to stay in the UK.</p>

<h3>Domestic legislation</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/72" rel="external">Section 72 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a> is the UK’s definition of when the serious criminality provision in Article 33(2) is to be applied. In particular, section 72(2)(a)-(b) states:</p>

<p>A person shall be presumed to have been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom if he is:</p>

<p>(a) convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and</p>

<p>(b) sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months.</p>

<p>However, the presumption that a person constitutes a danger to the community is rebuttable by that person.</p>

<h2>Differentiated refugee permission to stay</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/contents/enacted" rel="external">2022 Act</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">Part 11 of the Immigration Rules</a> contains the legal framework within which a person granted refugee status in the UK will be provided with permission to stay. A recipient of refugee status will either be granted refugee permission to stay or temporary refugee permission to stay.</p>

<p>When considering which permission to stay a claimant qualifies for, you must demonstrate that the criteria in Part 11 of the Immigration Rules are met. The standard of proof applicable to which form of permission to stay a refugee qualifies for is the balance of probabilities. This means when considering the requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12 of the 2022 Act</a>, you must apply this standard.</p>

<p>The Nationality and Borders Act 2022</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12 of the 2022 Act</a> provides the legal framework under which refugees may be treated differently in the UK. The Act reads:</p>

<p>“(1) For the purposes of this section—</p>

<p>(a) a refugee is a Group 1 refugee if they have complied with both of the requirements set out in subsection (2) and, where applicable, the additional requirement in subsection (3);</p>

<p>(b) otherwise, a refugee is a Group 2 refugee.</p>

<p>(2) The requirements in this subsection are that—</p>

<p>(a) they have come to the United Kingdom directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened (in the sense of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention), and</p>

<p>(b) they have presented themselves without delay to the authorities. Subsections (1) to (3) of section 36 apply in relation to the interpretation of paragraphs (a) and (b) as they apply in relation to the interpretation of those requirements in Article 31(1) of the Refugee Convention.</p>

<p>(3) Where a refugee has entered or is present in the United Kingdom unlawfully, the additional requirement is that they can show good cause for their unlawful entry or presence.</p>

<p>(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), a person’s entry into or presence in the United Kingdom is unlawful if they require leave to enter or remain and do not have it.”</p>

<p>A Group 1 refugee will be granted refugee permission to stay whilst a Group 2 refugee will be granted temporary refugee permission to stay. Only those with refugee status in the UK will be granted refugee permission to stay or temporary refugee permission to stay.</p>

<p>For guidance on how to consider whether an individual is a Group 1 or Group 2 refugee based on the requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12 of the 2022 Act</a>, please see the Assessing credibility and refugee status guidance.</p>

<h3>Refugee permission to stay (‘refugee permission’)</h3>

<h2>Family members</h2>

<p>Family members who have been accepted as dependants on the asylum claim in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraph 349</a> of the Immigration Rules will normally be granted permission to stay in line with the main claimant under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraph 339Q</a>C. See Dependants and former dependants guidance.</p>

<p>You must consider the best interests of children granted permission to stay on a protection route, whether they are the main claimant or a dependant on a family member’s claim.</p>

<p>Those who are granted refugee permission to stay are also able to sponsor their partner and children under the age of 18 to join them in the UK under the family reunion provisions in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraphs 352 to 352FJ</a>. This would normally be through an application for entry clearance, but family members can also apply in country. See the published policy on Family Reunion: for refugees and those with humanitarian protection for further guidance.</p>

<p>Those who are granted temporary refugee permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay are not able to sponsor their partner and children under the age of 18 to join them in the UK unless a refusal would breach our obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR. See published policy on Family Reunion: for refugees and those with humanitarian protection for further guidance.</p>

<h2>Refusing permission to stay on a protection route</h2>

<p>Only those granted refugee status under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules</a> can be granted refugee permission to stay or temporary refugee permission to stay.</p>

<p>You only need to consider whether the claimant would be a Group 1 refugee or Group 2 refugee where you are granting refugee status. Consequently, when refusing refugee status, you do not need to consider the claimant’s compliance with the requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/36/section/12/enacted" rel="external">Section 12 of the 2022 Act</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, only those granted humanitarian protection under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules</a> can be granted temporary humanitarian permission to stay.</p>

<h2>Allowed appeals</h2>

<p>All decisions to refuse a protection claim attract a right of appeal under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/41/section/82" rel="external">Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</a>. This includes where refugee status is refused, but humanitarian protection is granted, or where refugee status and humanitarian protection is refused, but another form of leave to remain, such as discretionary leave, is granted.</p>

<p>Where you refuse refugee status, but the appeal is later allowed on asylum grounds, the judge will not decide whether the refugee falls into Group 1 or Group 2. You will have to decide whether the refugee falls into Group 1 or Group 2 following the allowed appeal. You must consider the relevant findings of the Court when deciding whether the refugee falls into Group 1 or Group 2. Please see the section on the ‘rebuttal process’ in the assessing credibility and refugee status guidance for more guidance.</p>

<p>There is no right of appeal or right of administrative review against the decision to grant refugee permission to stay or temporary refugee permission to stay.</p>

<h2>Applications for further permission to stay on a protection route</h2>

<h3>Pre-Nationality and Borders Act 2022 claims</h3>

<p>For guidance on granting permission to stay to individuals granted refugee status or humanitarian protection as a result of asylum claims made before 28 June 2022, please see the refugee and humanitarian protection leave guidance.</p>

<h3>Applications for longer periods of permission to stay</h3>

<p>This guidance outlines the normal length of permission to stay which will be provided to an individual granted refugee status or humanitarian protection in the UK. However, there may be exceptional circumstances which warrant a longer period of permission to stay. A claimant may make such a request as part of their initial claim or make an application at any point thereafter. A claimant may also have indicated particular vulnerabilities as part of their asylum claim which you must consider in deciding whether to grant a longer permission to stay, even if the claimant has not made a specific request or application for a longer period of permission to stay.</p>

<p>A longer period of permission to stay will only be granted in the most exceptional of circumstances. This means not only a situation which is unusual but one which is distinguished to a high degree from others who need international protection, to the extent that it is necessary to deviate from the normal grant of permission to stay.</p>

<p>The claimant must provide specific evidence in support of why a longer period of permission to stay is appropriate. In the case of medical or mental health issues, the evidence must specifically address why the longer period of permission to stay is relevant to the claimant and why the normal period is insufficient. It is highly unlikely that a request for indefinite permission to stay (also referred to as ‘indefinite leave to remain’ or ‘settlement’) on account of, for example, employment or educational opportunities will succeed but you must consider if there are any other reasons to divert from a normal period. The best interests of the child must also be considered in deciding whether a longer period permission of stay may be appropriate. Any grant of a longer period of permission to stay, including indefinite permission to stay, must be approved by a senior manager (SEO or above).</p>

<h3>Individuals with refugee permission to stay</h3>

<p>Individuals with refugee status and refugee permission to stay (Group 1 refugees) are eligible to apply for settlement protection after 5 years on a protection route.</p>

<p>Such individuals should apply on the specified application form in the last 28-days of their current grant of permission to stay.</p>

<p>The settlement application must be made using the appropriate application form, which is available on the GOV.UK website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-settle-in-uk-as-refugee-form-set-protection-route">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-to-settle-in-uk-as-refugee-form-set-protection-route</a>.</p>

<p>Applicants for settlement protection who have not been granted refugee permission to stay, for example those with temporary refugee permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay, will have their applications rejected as invalid. For more information, please see the settlement protection guidance.</p>

<h3>Individuals with temporary refugee permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay</h3>

<p>Individuals with refugee status and temporary refugee permission to stay (Group 2 refugees), or humanitarian protection and temporary humanitarian permission to stay are eligible to apply for further permission to stay after 30-months on a protection route. Such individuals should apply on the specified application form in the last 28- days of their current grant of permission to stay. The specified application form will be available on GOV.UK before the first cohort of applicants with temporary refugee permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay need to apply for further permission to stay on a protection route.</p>

<p>Applicants for settlement protection who, following an asylum application made on or after 28 June 2022, have not been granted refugee permission to stay will have their applications rejected as invalid.</p>

<p>Individuals with temporary refugee permission to stay or temporary humanitarian permission to stay may be eligible to apply for settlement after 10 years lawful residence in the UK. Further information is available at: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/long-residence">Long residence - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe return review</h3>

<p>All those who apply for further permission to stay on a protection route, including settlement protection, will be subject to a safe return review with reference to the country situation at the date the application is considered. Those who still need protection upon applying will normally qualify for further permission to stay or settlement. You must consider the conditions attached to grants of further permission to stay when considering applications for further permission to stay. In the vast majority of cases, it is likely that a person’s protection needs will remain and that further permission to stay or settlement would be granted on that basis. You must refer to the Settlement Protection instruction for more detailed guidance on conducting safe return reviews.</p>

<p>An individual’s case may also be reviewed either when triggered by their actions, for example, they are convicted of a particularly serious crime, or in light of a significant and non-temporary change in conditions in their country of origin such that they no longer need protection. Permission to stay on a protection route may be curtailed or revoked under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-11-asylum">339QD of the Immigration Rules</a> where someone no longer needs, is</p>

<p>no longer entitled to protection due to their actions, or should not have been given protection under the Refugee Convention. See Revocation of protection status for further guidance.</p>

<h3>Individuals who do not apply for further permission to stay</h3>

<p>Where an individual on a protection route does not apply for further permission to stay before their current permission expires or does not apply for further permission to stay at all, they become an overstayer and are no longer entitled to the benefits associated with a valid period of permission to stay on a protection route, for example permission to work.</p>

<p>They also become liable to removal but remain in recognised need of international protection until and unless their refugee status or humanitarian protection is revoked. Therefore, you must revoke their refugee status or humanitarian protection before they are removed. For more guidance on when it is appropriate to revoke refugee status or humanitarian protection, please see the guidance on revocation of protection status.</p>

<p>Where evidence comes to light that an individual has overstayed and has not made an application for further permission to stay, you must consider whether there are grounds to refer the case to the Status Review Unit. For more guidance on when it is appropriate to refer cases to the Status Review Unit, please see the guidance on revocation of protection status.</p>

<p>The reasons why an individual with refugee status or humanitarian protection applied late for a further period of leave should be explored including by contacting the applicant if necessary. Reasons could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>lack of legal advice or poor advice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>language difficulties</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>level of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>destitution or near destitution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>illness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>experiences of social marginalisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inability to travel (for example due to a pandemic)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where the individual provides sufficient reasons for the late application, and there are no reasons to refer the case to the Status Review Unit for consideration of revocation, then you must process the application for further permission or settlement protection in the normal way.</p>

<p>In cases where an applicant does not provide sufficient reasons why their application was not made in time, they should still be presumed to be entitled to protection, though their case can be referred to Status Review Unit for a review of their continuing need for protection should there be grounds to do so. Should protection status be retained, you must normally grant a further period of permission to stay in- line with this guidance.</p>
