<h3>Victim Support</h3>

<p>Speak to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/" rel="external">Victim Support</a> first by contacting their free 24/7 support line on 0808 168 9111 or via live chat by visiting <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.victimsupport.org.uk/live-chat" rel="external">http://www.victimsupport.org.uk/live-chat</a>.</p>

<p>The Home Office funds 4 organisations as part of a victim and survivor pathway to help victims and survivors cope with, and recover from, the impact and consequences of a terrorist attack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Victim Support - conducts terror incident needs assessments (TINA) for each survivor - they refer individuals on to the following services if appropriate</li>
  <li>Cruse Bereavement Support – provides bereavement support and advice to those victims not currently eligible for support through the homicide service (that is, individuals who are not immediate family members)</li>
  <li>South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) – provides clinical mental health assessments and onward referral for those affected by terrorism</li>
  <li>Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Peace Foundation – facilitates a long-term, peer support network to help victims and survivors of terrorism support each other</li>
</ul>

<h2>More about the victim and survivor pathway</h2>

<p>All victims and survivors are first referred, or can self-refer, to Victim Support. Victim Support conducts a terror incident needs assessment (TINA) to make sure all the individual’s needs are identified and addressed.</p>

<p>The victim or survivor owns the TINA and takes it with them as they access each support organisation in the pathway, so that they don’t have to repeat their story.</p>

<p>These support services are available for victims or survivors of attacks in the UK, or when returning to the UK following an attack overseas, as well as those affected by historic attacks who would benefit from more support.</p>

<p>The pathway is only one potential route to support. It does not replace the support already provided by these or other organisations.</p>
