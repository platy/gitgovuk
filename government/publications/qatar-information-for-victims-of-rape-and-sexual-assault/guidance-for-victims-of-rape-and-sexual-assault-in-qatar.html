<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 999;</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one;</li>
  <li>contact your nearest British Embassy on +974 4496 2000. Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-doha">British Embassy in Doha</a></p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Qatar</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you contact the British embassy they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy on +974 4496 2000 and they can offer you consular support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts/WhatsApp messages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Insist you get a police report, with a case number. This document is likely to be in Arabic and you will be expected to get your own translation. The British Embassy will be able to provide you with a list of translation companies who have assisted British nationals in the past (translators are included on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-list-of-lawyers">same link</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Qatar is a conservative Muslim state and as such extramarital sex in Qatar is a crime. The term extramarital sex applies to a married person having sex with another who is not their spouse in addition to single people having sex outside of marriage. The survivor of rape and/or sexual assault also faces being charged with having sex outside of marriage. However, this is at the discretion of the Public Prosecutor and will be dependent on all of the facts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Homosexuality is a criminal offence in Qatar. All parties, if found guilty of these offences could face a fine, prison sentence and/or deportation. Muslims, regardless of nationality, may also face corporal punishment (usually flogging).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst there are a number of hotels in Qatar, which are licensed to serve alcohol, it is a criminal offence to drink or to be drunk in a public place. Anyone found guilty of these offences could face a fine, prison sentence and/or deportation. Blood tests will be carried out as part of the forensic investigation. If the survivor is found to have alcohol in their system, or was drinking prior to the attack, this may count against them in court.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no guarantee that there will be specially trained officers to deal with survivors of rape or sexual assault when reporting the offence and not every police station will have female officers. Equally, the level of English spoken and understood could be minimal. If possible, take someone with you who speaks Arabic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A representative from the Consular section may accompany you to the police station should you choose to report the crime. However, they will not be able to intervene in the investigation process and any translation done will be on the understanding it is on an informal basis, as it is unlikely they are qualified translators. Please bear in mind there is no guarantee that consular staff available will be able to translate for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst an investigation is on-going, both the attacker and the survivor may find that their passports are withheld, to be returned to them upon conclusion of the case. Alternatively, whilst passports may not be held on to by the police, all parties could find themselves subject to travel bans (preventing exit from Qatar) and this could also include any witnesses to the case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Qatar</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Consular section will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consular officers can provide you with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-doctors">lists of English-speaking medical facilities</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-list-of-lawyers">lawyers and translators</a> here in Qatar, should you wish to seek advice or medical attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you choose not to the report the crime, you may still be able to seek medical attention whether this is at the Women’s Wellness &amp; Research Centre Emergency Department or a private clinic. However, all medical facilities are legally obliged to report cases of rape and sexual assault and the results from any examinations will be shared with the local police force. So even if you choose not to report the crime, the police will normally be notified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate</a>, - or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Qatar - what happens next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In choosing to report the case in Qatar, you will be expected to provide a full statement, giving details about where, when, who, the amount of force, any witnesses etc. You may also be asked to leave any clothing that you were wearing at the time of the attack for further forensic testing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a crime has been reported, you will be asked to attend The Forensic Medicine Centre. The FMC is not attached to Hamad Hospital and if requested, a member of the consular team can accompany you to the appointment. Here you will undergo a physical examination and have bloods taken, to establish whether alcohol and drugs were involved, especially in an allegation of date rape. These results will then be sent directly to the police.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The forensic examination will be carried out by same sex doctors at the Forensic Medical Centre. Details will be taken and the examination will also note any bruising, cuts, or marks on your body, as well as an internal examination, together with swabs. These will all be included in the report sent to the police, and as evidence presented in court, should there be a court case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A member of the Consular section may accompany you to the centre for this appointment. However, we are unable to provide any medical translation services and if any translation is provided, it will be purely on an informal basis. If you have a friend, who speaks Arabic, it would be helpful if they could accompany you, so that you understand everything that is being asked of you or is being said to you, as it maybe that the level of English spoken and understood by medical staff is minimal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Not all hospitals are able to treat survivors of rape and sexual assault, even where someone has chosen to go to a private medical facility, they may be asked to attend the Emergency Department at Women’s Wellness and Research Centre (WWRC). This hospital has been designed around female needs and there is always a consultant available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please bear in mind all medical staff in Qatar (regardless of which facility they work for) are legally obliged to notify the police of any allegations of rape and sexual assault. There is a police station within Hamad General Hospital itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rape survivors are treated as priority cases, however, it will be dependent on the existing cases already admitted as to the timeframe within which you will be seen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can expect to be seen by a female consultant/senior consultant. If, this is not the case, please speak to staff and make them aware if you are uncomfortable being cared for by male medical staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When attending the WWRC, please ask that a social worker is assigned to your case. The social worker will act as a point of contact for you and will be responsible for coordinating actions between you, the patient, family, care givers, legal guardian or next of kin, the hospital and other agencies (including the police).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please ensure that as a resident you bring with you your Hamad Health Card, QID and insurance documents. Non-residents should bring with them, their passports and insurance documents. Copies of these documents can be used, if the police are in possession of any of these original items. Whilst treatment will not be denied if these documents are not available at the time, these documents should be provided as soon as practically possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HIV PEP medication (Post-exposure prophylaxis), a treatment that can prevent HIV infection is available in Qatar but is only available through Hamad Medical Corporation at the Women’s Wellness and Research Centre. PEP will be given where there are suspicions that the alleged attacker may be HIV positive. Advice about PEP will be given at the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on your return to the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are concerned about the possibility of contracting sexually transmitted infections, please request that the appropriate tests be administered when you first attend the facility. You should also ask that these tests be repeated in the future as some infections will take time to develop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no emergency contraception available in Qatar. The attending physician will prescribe treatment as required by the medical needs of the patient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Police investigations in Qatar – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As part of their investigation, the police may take the survivor to the scene of the crime, either to demonstrate what happened or to try and identify and arrest the person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where an arrest is made, it is usual for the alleged attacker to be taken before the Public Prosecution within 24 hours of their arrest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As with all cases, it is always better for the survivor to appear in person during the police investigation, in order to give their statement and evidence and they should seek the advice of a lawyer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once engaged the lawyer will have access to the case papers. Any lawyer should be engaged as early as possible, so that they are fully versed in the case. Some English speaking law firms do offer an initial pro bono service but this is limited to 1 email or 1 telephone or 1 office based appointment and will be time limited. This may not always be available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a survivor will be permitted to leave the country, will very much depend on whether a travel ban has been placed on the survivor, either by the Police, Public Prosecution or at the request of the alleged attackers defence lawyer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All survivors can expect to be called to testify at court hearings and to give evidence. It is very unusual for a case to be heard in closed court, or for evidence to be given from behind screens or via video link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the survivor does not have a lawyer they will be responsible for following up through the Public Prosecution. If the survivor appoints a lawyer, the lawyer will follow up on the case and will likely have access to more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case is referred for further investigation, the survivor might be asked for further information and/or evidence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survivor can relinquish their rights in relation to a claim, however it will depend on the judge’s discretion to continue or close the case. There are no repercussions for the survivor if they choose to withdraw their case unless, it is proven that there were no merits to the claim in the first instance and/or it was filed maliciously or vindictively. A case can be withdrawn, if the case has not been referred to the court.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survivor may be questioned by either the prosecutor, defendant or their lawyer, if they appear in court. Questions posed in absentia may be responded to via notarised affidavit. Their sexual history may be taken into consideration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where the survivor is filing a civil compensation case, their identity is not concealed, however, they may decide not to attend the hearing. In the criminal case, if the judge finds that the case harms the dignity of the parties, he might decide to proceed in a closed court.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The alleged attacker could also file a counter claim against the survivor. Such a counter claim needs to be filed at the initial stages of the investigation by the Police and Public Prosecutor before the matter proceeds to court. Where a claim and counter-claim are filed, they will be dealt with together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The survivor cannot be charged with sex outside marriage unless the public prosecution has filed such a case against the survivor; this will be at the public prosecution’s discretion and dependent on all facts. This also applies should either party be married, it will be the public prosecution’s discretion as to whether either party is charged with adultery. Should the survivor become pregnant as a result of this alleged attack, it will have no bearing on the case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Trial procedures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After a report is filed, the survivor will be presented to the Public Prosecution to give their statement. The Public Prosecution will conduct an investigation by taking statements from the accused and any witnesses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the case is referred to court, the survivor shall follow up on the status of their report through the Public Prosecution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Public Prosecution will notify both parties once the case is referred to court through their registered addresses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trial will be in Arabic, and there should be an interpreter for any non-Arabic speaker. If the survivor does not have a lawyer, they must physically attend hearings. If the survivor has appointed a lawyer, they must attend at least one hearing to give their statement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the survivor is not in Qatar and must attend a hearing, the survivor must make their own arrangements for travel, accommodation and visa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very difficult to predetermine the period for which a trial would last due to the different circumstances of each case. A case will last longer if an appeal is filed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hiring a lawyer</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure to hire a lawyer who specialises in criminal law. Consular officers can provide you with a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-qatar">list of English speaking local lawyers</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The survivor must appoint a lawyer to pursue the case if they are planning to leave Qatar. During the investigations, the survivor’s place of residence and contact information is taken. When the survivor appoints a lawyer, the lawyer will have access to the case information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the survivor does not appoint a lawyer, they can follow up via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sjc.gov.qa/en/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">electronic court portal</a> with their case number. However, if they do not have a lawyer, they may have access to limited information regarding their case.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Legal aid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Both the survivor and the accused can submit a request for legal aid from the Court of Appeal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal aid, if granted, will cover the case until its completion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sentencing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Sentences are weighted in favour of punishment, instead of rehabilitation.</li>
  <li>If the perpetrator is found to be guilty, the charge will likely fall under “offences against morals” or “crime against the person.”</li>
  <li>Sentences will be determined in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.almeezan.qa/LawArticles.aspx?LawTreeSectionID=255&amp;lawId=26&amp;language=en" rel="external">Qatari Penal Code No. 11/2004 in Articles 279 to 289.</a>
</li>
  <li>If the alleged perpetrator is found not guilty, they can file a case against the victim.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The survivor has the right to file a civil claim for provisional compensation during investigations or trial, and the court can award them temporary compensation.</li>
  <li>The victim may claim compensation for material and moral damages. The court may refer the compensation claim to the civil court, which will decide on all the elements of compensation.</li>
  <li>There is no state-funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a sexual or violent crime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live</li>
</ul>
