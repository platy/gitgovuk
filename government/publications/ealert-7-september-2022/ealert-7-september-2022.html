<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Development Woodland Officer apprenticeship programme starts</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Welcoming our apprentices at Cannock Chase Forest.</h3>

<p>A welcome event to mark the start of the new Development Woodland Officer apprenticeship programme took place today at Cannock Chase Forest, Rugeley.</p>

<p>19 Forestry Commission apprentices have been accepted onto the first degree-level forestry apprenticeship in the UK, following a rigorous selection process. In addition to the Forestry Commission apprentices, both National Trust and Woodland Trust also have individuals undertaking the apprenticeship.</p>

<p>From today, the 2022 cohort will undertake academic studies in forestry management at the University of Cumbria, practical experience in Forestry Commission area teams across England, and nine months of wider sector placements to further build their skills and experience, enhancing future employment prospects.</p>

<p>The Development Woodland Officer programme offers a three-year, paid development opportunity for passionate individuals looking to kickstart their careers in forestry and is jointly led by the Forestry Commission, the University of Cumbria and the Institute of Chartered Foresters.</p>

<p>The initiative aims to grow, upskill, and diversify the forestry sector workforce. Expanding long-term workforce capacity will help to deliver the Government’s tree planting and woodland creation ambitions over the coming years.</p>

<p>At the event, apprentices were welcomed by Richard Stanford, Forestry Commission CEO as well as representatives from the Institute of Chartered Foresters and University of Cumbria. Over the new few weeks, apprentices will enjoy induction sessions at Cannock Chase and training at the University of Cumbria before moving on to their regional teams.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Have your Woodland Management Plan ready</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>As we expect 2023 to be the last round of Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier, make sure that you submit your Woodland Management Plan by the end of December 2022.</h3>

<p>2023 is planned to be the last year for you to apply for the Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier (CS HT). Woodland element of the CS HT application must be covered by an approved (or approved in principle) Woodland Management Plan and we encourage you to ensure your draft plan is submitted to the Forestry Commission by the end of December 2022.</p>

<p>You must have an approved WMP throughout the 5 year period of your CS HT agreement and if your WMP ends before your CS HT agreement, you will need to apply for another WMP to ensure there is a plan in place.</p>

<p>If your land contains a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), in or outside of woodland, you must contact Natural England (NE) before the agreement starts as NE must approve any new WMP alongside a SSSI ‘supplementary notice of operations’. If the SSSI is found to be in poor condition, a feasibility study (PA2) may also be required before a Higher Tier application can begin.</p>

<p>Where your CS HT application includes historic environment multi-year options, or capital items within the woodland, work related to Scheduled Monuments may require Historic England consent, you can contact Historic England by email or phone:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:customers@HistoricEngland.org.uk">customers@HistoricEngland.org.uk</a></li>
  <li>0370 333 0607</li>
</ul>

<p>This can either be obtained separately, or alongside the Forestry Commission’s approval of your WMP. Your WMP must support your Higher Tier application requirements under the WD2 or historic environment options and show why you need the capital items included in your application.</p>

<p>You can read more information about WMPs, including information about funding, and download the templates on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/create-a-woodland-management-plan">Create a woodland management plan</a>.</p>

<p>You can use other templates needed for a Forestry Commission approved <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">UK Forestry Standard</a> compliant WMP, for example, a WMP produced to gain access to the UK Woodland Assurance Scheme (UKWAS), but only Forestry Commission templates must be used for your WMP using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-management-plan-grant-countryside-stewardship">Countryside Stewardship Woodland Management Plan grant</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Amending Woodland Management Plans to support Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier applications</h2>

<p>You may find your current Woodland Management Plan (WMP) does not support your Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier (CSHT) application. For example, an older WMP might not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accurately reflect the current woodland management objectives</li>
  <li>fully address the current constraints and threats affecting woodland management</li>
  <li>be compliant with the current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-forestry-standard">UK Forestry Standard</a> (revised 2017)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to discuss any changes with your Woodland Officer as soon as possible, you may be able to make amendments to your WMP as part of making your Higher Tier application but depending on the type amendment needed it is always best to plan ahead of your CS HT application.</p>

<p>To get this approval you might have to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hold discussions with relevant stakeholders</li>
  <li>apply for and get additional felling permissions</li>
  <li>arrange for any other consents needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the WMP needs an amendment to support management options/item requests (for example if using WD2 to support a priority objective that is not within the existing WMP), the WMP must be amended and approved by the final application deadline (tbc for applications in 2023).</p>

<p>Forestry Commission Woodland Officers can advise if you are eligible for new PA3 or not and on the likelihood of amendments being approved in time. You must submit your amended WMP to your local <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission/about/access-and-opening">Forestry Commission Woodland Officer</a> allowing enough time for approval.</p>
