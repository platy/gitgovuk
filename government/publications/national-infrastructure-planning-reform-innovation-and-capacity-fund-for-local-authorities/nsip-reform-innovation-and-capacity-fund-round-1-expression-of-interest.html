<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Contextual summary</h2>

<p>The Planning Act 2008 (the ‘Planning Act’) created a new development consent regime for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (<abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr>) in the fields of energy, transport, water, wastewater, and waste. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-infrastructure-strategy">National Infrastructure Strategy</a> later committed the government to establishing an <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> Reform Programme which aims to speed up the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> planning process by 50% for some projects entering the system in September 2023. The key outcomes of the programme are to achieve improvements in certainty, quality, and speed of the planning process for NSIPs.</p>

<p>The system is currently dealing with an increased rate of projects entering the system which are more complex than previous projects and require specialist knowledge and experienced personnel to consider wider issues like Net Zero and Bio-diversity Net Gain. This increase in both quantity and complexity of NSIPs is likely to reduce the speed at which <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects progress through the system and result in delays to decisions on Development Consent Orders due to poor quality or missing information.</p>

<p>The aim of this fund is to explore if and how using resources more efficiently or supplying additional resources for key users of the regime can improve our programme outcomes through provision of expertise or innovative work. This expression of interest constitutes an opportunity for local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) to apply for funding up to £100,000 to support them in dealing with <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> applications to address the issues and challenges they face as key users of the system.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What are we looking for?</h2>

<p>We are inviting <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to consider ways in which their role in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process could be improved or done differently to help drive better, greener and faster delivery of <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects. This fund is targeted at <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> (or groups of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) which expect to have a major role to play, as statutory consultee, in one or more Development Consent Order (<abbr title="Development Consent Order">DCO</abbr>) applications and are to be delivered during the period from the launch of this fund to March 2030. The project must be in one of the following phases, pre-application, acceptance, application, pre-examination or examination.</p>

<p>We are looking for proposals which drive better effective engagement with the developer, Planning Inspectorate and other statutory consultees in order to ensure that the <abbr title="Development Consent Order">DCO</abbr> process delivers benefits for local communities in line with the government’s ambitions for better, faster and greener infrastructure delivery and our mission for levelling up (in this case securing economic benefit for local communities from the investment that major infrastructure development offers).</p>

<p>We expect to issue grants up to £100,000 to be used for initiatives which are over and above work that the authority already intends on undertaking. Bids which have an element of match funding from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and/ or demonstrate collaboration between authorities are particularly encouraged but are not compulsory.</p>

<p>We are asking <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to address one, or several, of the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop innovative approaches to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement with NSIPs.</li>
  <li>Identify and drive efficiencies in <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement with other system users including the Planning Inspectorate and Project Promoters.</li>
  <li>Achieve efficiencies or savings through collaboration with other <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> (e.g. shared resources or representations).</li>
  <li>Produce learning which could help enhance <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement on other NSIPs.</li>
  <li>Identify how sustainability can be embedded in any new models/processes/structures (i.e., transition to business as usual)</li>
  <li>Drive innovations which could support greener <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects.</li>
  <li>Develop measures that enable better community and/ or <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement at pre-application.</li>
  <li>Introduce digital innovations including digital ways of working and/ or better use of digital data in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process.</li>
  <li>Development of innovations at various stages of the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process and contribute to better, greener or faster results.</li>
  <li>Improved adequacy of consultation.</li>
  <li>Managing the demands of multiple <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects in the same locality, especially when these overlap temporally, and or, spatially.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage innovative bids, but example proposals could include commissioning research projects, engaging consultants to support development of processes or tools, onboarding project support or expertise in a particular area, design and development of new delivery models.</p>

<p>The proposal must be centred around <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects which have already entered or will enter one of the recognised phases (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/application-process/the-process/" rel="external">pre-application, acceptance, pre-examination or examination</a>) in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process during the period at which the funding is provided (January 2022 to June 2023). Only funding for work focusing on these phases will be considered to increase the period of time within which lessons or recommendations to the process can be adopted prior to entering decision phase.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Expressions of interest submission</h2>

<p>The programme will provide funding for successful bids up to the value of £100,000 per bid.
