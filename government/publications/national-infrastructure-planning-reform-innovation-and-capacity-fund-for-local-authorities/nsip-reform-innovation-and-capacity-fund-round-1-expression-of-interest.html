<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Contextual summary</h2>

<p>The Planning Act 2008 (the ‘Planning Act’) created a new development consent regime for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (<abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr>) in the fields of energy, transport, water, wastewater, and waste. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-infrastructure-strategy">National Infrastructure Strategy</a> later committed the government to establishing an <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> Reform Programme which aims to speed up the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> planning process by 50% for some projects entering the system in September 2023. The key outcomes of the programme are to achieve improvements in certainty, quality, and speed of the planning process for NSIPs.</p>

<p>The system is currently dealing with an increased rate of projects entering the system which are more complex than previous projects and require specialist knowledge and experienced personnel to consider wider issues like Net Zero and Bio-diversity Net Gain. This increase in both quantity and complexity of NSIPs is likely to reduce the speed at which <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects progress through the system and result in delays to decisions on Development Consent Orders due to poor quality or missing information.</p>

<p>The aim of this fund is to explore if and how using resources more efficiently or supplying additional resources for key users of the regime can improve our programme outcomes through provision of expertise or innovative work. This expression of interest constitutes an opportunity for local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) to apply for funding up to £100,000 to support them in dealing with <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> applications to address the issues and challenges they face as key users of the system.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What are we looking for?</h2>

<p>We are inviting <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to consider ways in which their role in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process could be improved or done differently to help drive better, greener and faster delivery of <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects. This fund is targeted at <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> (or groups of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) which expect to have a major role to play, as statutory consultee, in one or more Development Consent Order (<abbr title="Development Consent Order">DCO</abbr>) applications and are to be delivered during the period from the launch of this fund to March 2030. The project must be in one of the following phases, pre-application, acceptance, application, pre-examination or examination.</p>

<p>We are looking for proposals which drive better effective engagement with the developer, Planning Inspectorate and other statutory consultees in order to ensure that the <abbr title="Development Consent Order">DCO</abbr> process delivers benefits for local communities in line with the government’s ambitions for better, faster and greener infrastructure delivery and our mission for levelling up (in this case securing economic benefit for local communities from the investment that major infrastructure development offers).</p>

<p>We expect to issue grants up to £100,000 to be used for initiatives which are over and above work that the authority already intends on undertaking. Bids which have an element of match funding from the <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> and/ or demonstrate collaboration between authorities are particularly encouraged but are not compulsory.</p>

<p>We are asking <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> to address one, or several, of the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop innovative approaches to <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement with NSIPs.</li>
  <li>Identify and drive efficiencies in <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement with other system users including the Planning Inspectorate and Project Promoters.</li>
  <li>Achieve efficiencies or savings through collaboration with other <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> (e.g. shared resources or representations).</li>
  <li>Produce learning which could help enhance <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement on other NSIPs.</li>
  <li>Identify how sustainability can be embedded in any new models/processes/structures (i.e., transition to business as usual)</li>
  <li>Drive innovations which could support greener <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects.</li>
  <li>Develop measures that enable better community and/ or <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> engagement at pre-application.</li>
  <li>Introduce digital innovations including digital ways of working and/ or better use of digital data in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process.</li>
  <li>Development of innovations at various stages of the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process and contribute to better, greener or faster results.</li>
  <li>Improved adequacy of consultation.</li>
  <li>Managing the demands of multiple <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects in the same locality, especially when these overlap temporally, and or, spatially.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage innovative bids, but example proposals could include commissioning research projects, engaging consultants to support development of processes or tools, onboarding project support or expertise in a particular area, design and development of new delivery models.</p>

<p>The proposal must be centred around <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> projects which have already entered or will enter one of the recognised phases (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/application-process/the-process/" rel="external">pre-application, acceptance, pre-examination or examination</a>) in the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process during the period at which the funding is provided (January 2022 to June 2023). Only funding for work focusing on these phases will be considered to increase the period of time within which lessons or recommendations to the process can be adopted prior to entering decision phase.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Expressions of interest submission</h2>

<p>The programme will provide funding for successful bids up to the value of £100,000 per bid.

<span class="number">15. </span>	Does match funding include staff time?</h3>

<p>No. Match funding refers to actual expenditure only, unless ‘staff time’ refers to peoples employed or contracted to deliver work specifically relating to this fund. Match funding is not compulsory.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The questions below were added following a Q&amp;A with potential applicants on 15 March 2022.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">16. </span>	Can multiple local authorities submit a joint bid for more than £100K funding?</h3>

<p>Funding is up to £100K per bid. <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> are welcome to submit complimentary bids, at £100K each, but there is no guarantee any or both will be taken forward. Bids must therefore be able to stand alone. Projects which seek to collaborate and coordinate their work with others is encouraged.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17. </span>	Can the fund be used for something which a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is already doing?</h3>

<p>If a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> is already doing something which is considered to be, or could become, ‘best practice’, and using this fund could help them develop or support it further, then yes. The <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> must be able to justify how additional funding would make a notable difference to what is already in place, and what the subsequent benefits would be.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">18. </span>	Is there a mechanism for sharing the outputs of successful proposals?</h3>

<p>It has not yet been confirmed how outputs will be shared with others. Successful bidders will have the opportunity to work with <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> and agree how outputs can be shared but could include sharing of physical documents, holding workshops or presentations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">19. </span>	Does the proposal have to be related to process or can it be a something standalone?</h3>

<p>The aim of the fund is to help local authorities engage with the <abbr title="Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects">NSIP</abbr> process. If the fund is used to develop something which ultimately results in that effect (like an enduring working group or a way of bringing together specialists) and the bidder can justify how this funding helps deliver that and any associated benefits, then yes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">20. </span>	Can a project be enduring?</h3>

<p>Yes. This funding could be used as a ‘start-up’ fund for something which will deliver longer term benefit beyond the period of funding. The bidder must be able to provide detail around the short, mid and long term benefits in a way which is relative to cost. The bidder should be aware that enduring costs over and above the agreed sum from this fund would not be covered by <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">21. </span>	How much engagement with the sponsor is needed?</h3>

<p>While it is encouraged, not all bids will depend on promotor collaboration or impact projects in a way which requires a sponsor to be engaged. Bids put forward must be deliverable so if collaboration is required, that initial engagement should have taken place before the bid is submitted or be identified in the risk section accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">22. </span>	Could the fund be used to procure additional expertise?</h3>

<p>Yes. If there is a skills or capacity gap, this fund could be used to upskill or provide expertise in a given area. Bidders should consider how they might capitalise on this learning to share and secure experience for future applications and other councils handling NSIPs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">23. </span>	Can local authorities focus more on ‘greener’ than ‘faster’ or ‘better’ objectives?</h3>

<p>Yes. Any initiatives which help deliver greener, better or faster NSIPs will be considered, but the bidder must consider all three so as not to prioritise one over the detriment or worsening of another.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">24. </span>	What level of detail is required for the financial breakdown?</h3>

<p>Local authorities must provide a breakdown which justifies the total funding requested. For example, if a council intend to hire a consultant for a given period of time, the cost breakdown must justify the time period, show how much the consultant costs (e.g. day rate) and what outputs would be provided during that period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">25. </span>	How many EOIs is <abbr title="Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities">DLUHC</abbr> anticipating putting through?</h3>

<p>The number of successful bids will be dependent on the number and quality of bids received.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">26. </span>	Can a <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> put more than one bid through?</h3>

<p>Yes. Any council may submit more than one bid, providing they are independent of one another.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">27. </span>	How does this fund tie in with wider PINS process?</h3>

<p>This fund targets local authorities and how they engage with the system. Through your EOI, we welcome ideas about how touch points with others could be improved.</p>
