<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide is part of All Our Health, a resource that helps health and care professionals prevent ill health and promote wellbeing as part of their everyday practice. It will help you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the specific activities and interventions that support a smoker to quit</li>
  <li>access training resources to support your learning and further develop your skills in motivating and supporting smokers to quit</li>
  <li>think about the resources and services available in your area that can help people quit smoking</li>
</ul>

<p>We also recommend important actions that managers and staff in strategic roles can take.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/all-our-health-personalised-care-and-population-health">All Our Health: personalised care and population health collection</a> contains the full range of All Our Health topics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Access the smoking and tobacco e-learning session</h2>
<p>An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/596376" rel="external">interactive e-learning version of this topic</a> is now available to use.</p>

<p>The Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>) and Health Education England’s ‘elearning for healthcare’ developed this e-learning to increase the confidence and skills of health and care professionals, to make prevention part of their day-to-day practice.</p>

<p>Completing this session will count towards your continued professional development.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Why you should focus on smoking in your professional practice</h2>
<p>Smoking is uniquely harmful, causing damage not only to smokers themselves but also to the people around them. Smoking is one of the main causes of health inequalities in England, with the harm concentrated in disadvantaged communities and groups.</p>

<p>Despite a continued decline in smoking prevalence, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2019" rel="external">13.9% of adults in England still smoke</a>. This equates to over 6 million people in 2019.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-tobacco-control-profiles-for-england-july-2021/local-tobacco-control-profiles-for-england-short-statistical-commentary-july-2021">Smoking is the leading preventable cause of illness and premature death, killing around 74,600 people in England in 2019</a>. <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> data indicates that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm" rel="external">for every death caused by smoking, at least 30 smokers are living with a serious smoking-related illness</a>.</p>

<p>In England in 2019 to 2020, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-smoking/statistics-on-smoking-england-2020" rel="external">there were an estimated 506,100 smoking-related admissions to hospital</a>, equating to almost 1,400 each day. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/quality-improvement/clinical-audit/bts-national-audit-reports/" rel="external">One in 4 patients in a hospital bed is a smoker</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england">Smokers also see their <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> 35% more than non-smokers</a>.</p>

<p>Stopping smoking at any time has considerable health benefits, including for people with a pre-existing smoking-related disease. For people using secondary care services, there are other advantages. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>shorter hospital stays</li>
  <li>lower drug doses</li>
  <li>fewer complications</li>
  <li>higher survival rates</li>
  <li>better wound healing</li>
  <li>decreased infections</li>
  <li>fewer re-admissions after surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>Smoking is not a lifestyle choice but a dependency requiring treatment. This was recognised in 2017 by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/towards-a-smoke-free-generation-tobacco-control-plan-for-england">government’s commitment for the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> in England to become smoke-free</a>. Supporting smokers in contact with the healthcare system to quit is a prevention priority in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan</a> and every health and care professional has a role to play. This will make a vital contribution to realising <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/advancing-our-health-prevention-in-the-2020s">the government’s ambition to achieve a smoke-free society in England by 2030</a>, defined as adult smoking prevalence of 5% or less.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Harm to health caused by smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body. It causes lung cancer, respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease, as well as many cancers in other organs including lip, mouth, throat, bladder, kidney, stomach, liver and cervix. Smoking reduces fertility and significantly raises the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, eye disease and dementia. It leads to decreased bone mineral density and is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, back pain and degenerative disc disease.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-prevalence-in-adults-current-smokers-aged-over-18-years-by-wellbeing-group-and-region">National data shows that smoking is also closely associated with poor mental health and wellbeing</a>. Smokers score worse than the population as a whole on every mental wellbeing indicator.</p>

<p>Secondhand smoke is dangerous for anyone exposed to it, but children are especially vulnerable due to breathing more rapidly and having less developed airways, lungs and immune systems.</p>

<p>Smoking is also harmful to mental health and wellbeing. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smoking-prevalence-in-adults-current-smokers-aged-over-18-years-by-wellbeing-group-and-region">National data shows that smokers score worse than the population as a whole on every mental wellbeing indicator</a>.</p>

<p>Smoking is the single most important modifiable risk factor in pregnancy. Smoking is associated with a range of poor pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, neonatal complications, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Smoking during pregnancy</h3>
<p>Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor in pregnancy. Smoking is associated with a range of poor pregnancy outcomes including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>miscarriage</li>
  <li>stillbirth</li>
  <li>premature birth</li>
  <li>neonatal complications</li>
  <li>low birth weight</li>
  <li>sudden infant death syndrome</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-women-s-smoking-status-at-time-of-delivery-england/statistics-on-womens-smoking-status-at-time-of-delivery-england---quarter-4-2020-21" rel="external">Around 1 in 10 babies in England is born to a mother who smoked throughout her pregnancy</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Smoking among people with mental health problems</h3>
<p>People with mental health problems are almost 2.5 times as likely to smoke as the general population. Smoking rates increase with the severity of mental illness. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tobacco-control/data#page/3/gid/1938132900/pat/6/par/E12000001/ati/302/are/E06000047/iid/92536/age/168/sex/4/cid/4/tbm/1" rel="external">Among adults with a serious mental illness, 40.5% smoke</a>. The high smoking rate among people with mental health conditions is the largest contributor to their 10 to 20 year reduced life expectancy.</p>

<p>People with a mental health condition are just as likely to want to stop smoking as those without, but they are more likely to be addicted to smoking and more likely to think it will be difficult to quit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Quitting smoking: the importance of support</h2>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2019#data-on-smokers-who-have-quit-and-smokers-who-intend-to-quit-great-britain-1974-to-2019" rel="external">Over half (52.7%) of smokers say they want to quit</a>, and 1 in 5 intends to do so within 3 months. Currently, around half of all smokers in England try to quit with no help, just using willpower alone, despite this being the least effective method.</p>

<p>Being encouraged by a healthcare professional is one of the most important motivational factors for someone who wants to quit smoking. The success of quit attempts can be significantly increased by helping patients identify and access appropriate quit aids and further support.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stop-smoking-options-guidance-for-conversations-with-patients">Stop smoking options: guidance for conversations with patients</a> was published to support conversations between clinicians and people who smoke on what method to choose to help them quit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Treating tobacco dependence in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>
</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan</a> sets out the commitment that by 2023 to 2024, all people admitted to an acute or mental health hospital who smoke will be offered <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> funded tobacco dependency treatment (based on the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation). <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff will deliver stop smoking support during and after the hospital stay and refer the patient into community stop smoking support when they are discharged.</p>

<p>The model will also be adapted for expectant mothers and their partners, with a new smoke-free pregnancy pathway. This will include focused sessions and treatments delivered in maternity settings.</p>

<p>Specialist mental health services, including learning disability services, will offer outpatient stop smoking support from 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>The gradual rollout of these <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan commitments began in 2020, with a phased approach. The aim is to cover 100% of relevant smokers by 2023 to 2024.</p>

<p>Primary care is a crucial part of the prevention pathway and will reach a larger number of healthier and younger smokers. Cost-effective smoking cessation interventions can be delivered simply and quickly through primary care to help reduce the number of people who smoke.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Local stop smoking services</h3>
<p>Expert support from a local stop smoking service gives smokers the best chance of quitting for good, making them 3 times as likely to succeed as if they try to quit without any help.</p>

<p>Depending on the area, services can be based in a range of settings including integrated lifestyle services, community pharmacies and <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> surgeries. Stop smoking services are free and offer a choice of one-to-one or group behavioural support from a trained stop smoking advisor, together with pharmacotherapy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Stop smoking aids</h3>
<p>There is a wide range of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stop-smoking-treatments/" rel="external">stop smoking aids</a> available, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nicotine replacement therapy (<abbr title="nicotine replacement therapy">NRT</abbr>) products such as patches, sprays, lozenges and gum</li>
  <li>e-cigarettes (vapes)</li>
  <li>prescription tablets Varenicline (Champix) and Bupropion (Zyban)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a stop smoking medicine prescribed by a healthcare professional doubles a smoker’s chances of quitting.</p>

<h4>E-cigarettes (vapes)</h4>
<p>E-cigarettes are the most commonly used quit aid among smokers in England and there is growing evidence of their effectiveness. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub6/full" rel="external">updated Cochrane Review</a> published in 2021 found that nicotine-containing e-cigarettes are around twice as effective in supporting smokers to quit as <abbr title="nicotine replacement therapies">NRTs</abbr> such as patches and gum.</p>

<p>E-cigarettes are not licensed as medicines in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, but they are tightly regulated for safety and quality. Most of the poisonous chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, including tar and carbon monoxide, are not in e-cigarette vapour. The chemicals that are in e-cigarette vapour are at much lower levels than in tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>Leading health and public health organisations including the Royal College of General Practitioners (<abbr title="Royal College of General Practitioners">RCGP</abbr>), British Medical Association (<abbr title="British Medical Association">BMA</abbr>), Cancer Research <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine agree that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they are far less harmful than cigarettes.</p>

<p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (<abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr>) guideline <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng209" rel="external">Tobacco: preventing uptake, promoting quitting and treating dependence</a> (NG209) includes recommendations on the advice that health and care professionals should provide to smokers on using e-cigarettes to quit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>The evidence on nicotine</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-and-heated-tobacco-products-evidence-review/">evidence shows that while nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, it is relatively harmless</a>. In fact, almost all the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic. Despite this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 in 10 smokers and ex-smokers incorrectly think nicotine causes most of the smoking-related cancer</li>
  <li>only a third of smokers know that <abbr title="nicotine replacement therapy">NRT</abbr> is much less harmful than cigarettes</li>
</ul>

<p>Advising smokers on the relative risks of nicotine-containing products compared to smoked tobacco is an important part of supporting them to quit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Core principles for health and care professionals</h2>

<p>Every front-line health and care professional should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss smoking with their patients</li>
  <li>routinely offer all smokers advice and support to quit smoking as part of routine care</li>
  <li>deliver evidence-based interventions in accordance with <abbr title="National Institute for Health and Care Excellence">NICE</abbr> guidance</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Taking action</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span>If you’re a front-line health and care professional</h3>
<p>As a health and care professional, you are best placed to motivate and support smokers on their quit journey. 
All health and care professionals should identify and refer smokers using the method known as very brief advice (<abbr title="very brief advice">VBA</abbr>), This has 3 components: ask, advise and act.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ask and record smoking status. Is the patient a smoker, ex-smoker or non-smoker?</li>
  <li>Advise on the best way of quitting. The best way of stopping smoking is with a combination of stop smoking aids and specialist support.</li>
  <li>Act on patient response. Build confidence, give information, refer and prescribe.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should undertake the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://elearning.ncsct.co.uk/" rel="external">free online training provided by the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training</a> (<abbr title="National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training">NCSCT</abbr>), and find out what local training is available and how you can access it.</p>

<p>You should make the most of existing opportunities including <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthcheck.nhs.uk/commissioners-and-providers/delivery/" rel="external"><abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Health Check</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/2019-20-general-medical-services-gms-contract-quality-and-outcomes-framework-qof/" rel="external">Quality and Outcomes Framework</a> to include tackling smoking in routine clinical care.</p>

<p>If you are a health and care professional working in a hospital, you should be familiar with the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trust’s operational procedures and policies for treating tobacco dependence and how to advise, record and initiate quitting support.</p>

<p>Specific training for front-line <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> staff, linked to the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan, is currently being developed by <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> England and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Improvement. This will cover training for staff delivering <abbr title="very brief advice">VBA</abbr> to patients on admission, as well as more in-depth training for those delivering the more intensive package of tobacco dependency treatment.</p>

<p>You should be aware of the quitting support available in your area and be able to refer smokers for specialist support. Ask your team leader or manager for this information.</p>

<p>Different approaches suit different people, so if the first thing a smoker tries does not help, they should try another way. We’ve published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/stop-smoking-options-guidance-for-conversations-with-patients">guidance to support you in your conversations with patients on what method to choose</a>.</p>

<h4>Working with pregnant women</h4>
<p>If you work with pregnant women, make sure all women have their carbon monoxide (<abbr title="carbon monoxide">CO</abbr>) monitored, and refer those with elevated levels for specialist stop smoking support. Also, make sure all members of the midwifery team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are trained to use the <abbr title="carbon monoxide">CO</abbr> monitor</li>
  <li>have brief meaningful conversations about the harms of smoking</li>
  <li>know about the quitting support available</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective pathways into specialist support should be in place, with feedback to the referring midwife.
The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/" rel="external">elearning for healthcare</a> platform also includes training modules on <abbr title="very brief advice">VBA</abbr> and <abbr title="carbon monoxide">CO</abbr> monitoring to support a smoke-free pregnancy. The training is free, but <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Register" rel="external">you need to register before you can log in</a>.</p>

<h4>Working with people who have mental health problems</h4>
<p>If you work with people who have mental health problems, make sure you treat tobacco dependence as part of routine clinical care.</p>

<p>People with mental health problems want to quit smoking as much as other smokers do and have the same right to be offered effective stop smoking support.</p>

<p>This includes providing access to a full range of stop smoking medicines and behavioural support to assist them in quitting for good or abstaining temporarily while in a smoke-free inpatient setting. You should encourage the use of e-cigarettes as one of the options available to support quitting or reduce harm.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span>If you’re a team leader or manager</h3>
<p>As a team leader or manager, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure the teams you lead are aware of the latest guidance and interventions on supporting people to stop smoking</li>
  <li>provide learning and development opportunities for team members on supporting smokers to quit and how they can provide <abbr title="very brief advice">VBA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>make sure there are clear local referral and care pathways to stop smoking support</li>
  <li>provide feedback to local commissioners and providers where services are working well and where there are problems accessing support for smokers who want to quit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span>If you’re a senior or strategic leader</h3>
<p>As a senior or strategic leader, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure there is a shared understanding of the local level of demand and need, based on a range of local and national data across a range of public services</li>
  <li>ensure that integrated care systems have prevention plans that set out the steps to be taken to effectively implement the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan commitments on tackling tobacco dependency</li>
  <li>commission evidenced-based stop smoking support that reflects strategic priorities and the needs of the local population</li>
  <li>consider whether your local tobacco control network would benefit from undertaking an evidenced-based <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-control-assessment/the-clear-improvement-model-excellence-in-tobacco-control"><abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> self-assessment</a> of their systems and services</li>
  <li>seek opportunities to work together on tobacco with local partners including primary care networks, secondary care providers, clinical commissioning groups, local authorities and integrated care systems</li>
  <li>work to promote tobacco dependency treatment prominently in all commissioned healthcare services</li>
  <li>make sure to include the  <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> Long Term Plan tobacco metrics in local performance monitoring systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Indicators of tobacco’s effect on local populations</h2>
<p>There are 3 indicators in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework" rel="external">Public Health Outcomes Framework</a> that relate to smoking:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Smoking status at time of delivery (indicator C06).</li>
  <li>Smoking prevalence at age 15 (indicator C13a ‘Regular Smokers’ and indicator C13b ‘Occasional Smokers’).</li>
  <li>Smoking prevalence in adults (18 and over) (current smokers) based on Annual Population Survey (<abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr>) data (indicator C18).</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tobacco-control" rel="external">Local Tobacco Control Profiles for England</a> provide data on the extent of tobacco use, tobacco-related harm, and measures being taken to reduce this harm at a local level. We designed the profiles to help local government and health services assess the effect of tobacco use on their local populations. Examples of indicators include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smoking prevalence in adults in routine and manual occupations (18 to 64) – current smokers (<abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr> data)</li>
  <li>smoking prevalence in adults (18 to 64) – socio-economic gap in current smokers (<abbr title="Annual Population Survey">APS</abbr> data)</li>
  <li>smoking prevalence in adults (18 and over) with serious mental illness</li>
  <li>smoking attributable mortality</li>
  <li>smoking attributable deaths from heart disease</li>
  <li>smoking attributable deaths from stroke</li>
  <li>smoking attributable hospital admissions</li>
  <li>potential years of life lost due to smoking-related illness</li>
  <li>smokers that have successfully quit at 4 weeks</li>
  <li>smokers setting a quit date</li>
  <li>smoking attributable deaths from cancer</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Measuring local impact</h2>
<p>As a health and care professional, there are many reasons why you should measure your impact and show the value of your contribution. This could be about sharing what has worked well to benefit your colleagues and local people, or to help you with your professional development.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Everyday Interactions toolkit</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact.html" rel="external">Royal Society for Public Health (<abbr title="Royal Society for Public Health">RSPH</abbr>) Everyday Interactions toolkit</a> provides a quick, straightforward and easy way for health and care professionals to record and measure their public health impact in a uniform and comparable way.</p>

<p><abbr title="Royal Society for Public Health">RSPH</abbr> also recommends the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/our-work/policy/wider-public-health-workforce/measuring-public-health-impact/smoking-and-tobacco.html" rel="external">smoking and tobacco impact pathway</a> for health and care professionals to record and measure actions undertaken as part of routine care.</p>

<abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> improvement model</h3>
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clear-local-tobacco-control-assessment"><abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> self-assessment</a> is a continuous improvement model that supports local action to reduce tobacco use. <abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> is an acronym for Challenging services, Leadership and Results. The model is designed to be used across local systems, by local authorities, tobacco alliances and <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> partners. The <abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> model offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a free-to-access self-assessment tool that can assist in evaluating the effectiveness of local action addressing harm from tobacco, a major aspect of any health and wellbeing strategy</li>
  <li>an opportunity to bring local partners together to discuss the range of local tobacco control efforts and reinforce efforts and priorities</li>
  <li>a chance to compare work on tobacco over time and against others</li>
</ul>

<p>A series of deep-dive self-assessment tools follow the same design as the generic <abbr title="Challenging services, Leadership and Results">CLeaR</abbr> improvement tool but focus on specific issues. They cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smoking in pregnancy</li>
  <li>smoking in acute settings</li>
  <li>smoking in mental health settings</li>
  <li>addressing the impact of illicit tobacco</li>
  <li>action on niche tobacco products (for example, shisha and smokeless tobacco)</li>
</ul>
