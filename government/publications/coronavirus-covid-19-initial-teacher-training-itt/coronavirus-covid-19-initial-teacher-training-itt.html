<p>The guidance is for initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>) providers. It includes actions you may wish to consider for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> courses disrupted by coronavirus (COVID-19). It is based on current public health advice.</p>

<p>These actions will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on your <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provision</li>
  <li>give trainees a fair opportunity to qualify</li>
  <li>safeguard teacher supply</li>
  <li>ensure those awarded qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) are of the highest possible quality</li>
</ul>

<p>We may amend or update this guidance as necessary.</p>

<h2>February 2021 updates</h2>

<p>We have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#critical-workers">updated the critical workers section</a></li>
  <li>added a section about <a href="#legal-reqs" class="govuk-link">legal requirements</a> and planned amendments to regulation</li>
  <li>updated the <a class="govuk-link" href="#remote-obs">remote observations, moderation and assessment section</a> with information on the Assessment Only (AO) route</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trainees not recommended for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in 2019 to 2020</h2>

<p>You should extend courses beyond their original planned end date for trainees you identify as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not meeting the Teachersâ Standards</li>
  <li>not on a trajectory to meet the Teachersâ Standards</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives these trainees an opportunity to show they meet the Teachersâ Standards in the autumn term.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to determine the content and duration of training for any trainees whose courses extend into the autumn term. This should be in line with current arrangements.</p>

<p>Funding is available for trainees and providers where courses extend owing to coronavirus (COVID-19). See guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/funding-itt-coronavirus-covid-19-course-extensions-2019-to-2020/coronavirus-covid-19-itt-course-extensions-funding-manual-2019-to-2020-academic-year" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> coronavirus (COVID-19) course extensions 2019 to 2020</a>.</p>

<h2>Recruitment and selection 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Recruitment to the 2021 to 2022 cohort will continue. You should consider how you can adapt your recruitment and selection process to minimise disruption.</p>

<p>Consider which parts of the process candidates can complete:</p>

<ul>
  <li>online</li>
  <li>over the phone</li>
  <li>using written tasks</li>
  <li>via video calling (for example, for individual interviews or group sessions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Observing a candidate interacting with children is not an entry requirement. Instead, consider getting additional evidence of suitability, such as references.</p>

<p>Advise partner schools to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exercise greater vigilance during the early stages of school-based training</li>
  <li>act immediately on any safeguarding concerns that might arise by following the process set out in their partnership agreement</li>
</ul>

<p>Ratifying university providers already have scope to interview on behalf of School Direct partnerships, subject to this being agreed across the wider partnership.</p>

<p>Supporting documentation (for example, examination certificates) can be submitted in electronic format pending the opportunity for originals to be supplied. You must continue to comply with statutory guidance set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2" class="govuk-link">keeping children safe in education</a>.</p>

<p>Continue using the <a href="https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.service.gov.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external">apply for postgraduate teacher training</a> service and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ucas.com/advisers/managing-applications" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr></a> to manage your applications.</p>

<p><abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> has reinstated all <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> teacher training decision-making deadlines, decline by default (<abbr title="decline by default">DBDs</abbr>) and reject by default (<abbr title="reject by default">RBDs</abbr>). See the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ucas.com/advisers/managing-applications/application-deadlines"><abbr title="Universities and Colleges Admissions Service">UCAS</abbr> guidance</a> for the latest information.</p>

<p>All upcoming Train to Teach events have been set up as online question and answer sessions. For more information and to register for these events visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/teaching-events" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a>.</p>

<h2>Entry criteria: GCSE and degree requirements 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Continue to allow candidates to provide evidence before they start their <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> courses that they have GCSE grade 4 (or equivalent) in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>maths</li>
  <li>a science subject (for primary)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can consider other evidence of attainment if you judge this to be at least equal to GCSE grade 4 in the relevant subject. This can include an equivalence test.</p>

<p>Candidates who are not able to demonstrate the required standard due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had until 30 November 2020 to demonstrate the standard.</p>

<p>For entry to graduate programmes of <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>, where there is a delay in the award of candidatesâ first degrees, trainees had until 30 November 2020 to provide evidence of the completion of their first degree.</p>

<p>Before admitting them to an <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course, consider the likelihood of a candidate achieving the requirements in the permitted timeframe. Trainees are not allowed to continue on courses without providing evidence of meeting the requirements by 30 November 2020.</p>

<p>Trainees who begin courses with C1.1 or C1.2 entry requirements still pending will not be eligible for financial incentives (bursaries or grants). On providing the required evidence, any financial incentive will be backdated to the start of the course. Further guidance on this will follow in the funding manuals.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria">initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>): criteria and supporting advice</a> for the full criteria.</p>

<p>Details on assessment for GCSEs in summer 2021 are due to be confirmed after consultation in the spring term. In the meantime, candidates should speak to their chosen training provider to discuss their situation.</p>

<h2>School experience</h2>

<p>School experience is not an entry requirement for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>. Lack of school experience should not be a reason for rejection of an otherwise suitable applicant. However, school experience may be helpful for those considering training to teach.</p>

<h3>Using the get school experience service</h3>

<p>We have marked schools on the <a href="https://schoolexperience.education.gov.uk/schools" class="govuk-link" rel="external">get school experience</a> service as inactive. Email <a href="mailto:organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">organise.school-experience@education.gov.uk</a> if youâre considering offering a virtual experience for candidates. This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>videos of lessons</li>
  <li>digital conferences</li>
  <li>online training materials for candidates to use</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then make your school active again.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> funding and bursaries</h2>

<p>Bursary, scholarship, School Direct salaried and postgraduate teaching apprenticeship grant payments will continue as normal.</p>

<p>You should continue to follow the relevant funding guidance. This includes making payments to trainees where applicable.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> trainees from overseas</h2>

<h3>International travel</h3>

<p>Although global travel may be affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), we still encourage overseas nationals to pursue becoming a teacher in England. Candidates should check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their countryâs advice on travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements</li>
  <li>the UKâs advice on travel restrictions and self-isolation requirements</li>
  <li>the guidance about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents#outside-uk">what to do if you need a visa to travel to the UK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Further information is available for those affected by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-immigration-and-borders">changes to UK immigration and borders due to coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h3>Immigration permission for trainees from the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland</h3>

<p>If an EEA or Swiss trainee undertaking an <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course in 2020 to 2021 delays their arrival in the UK until 1 January 2021 or later, they may be affected by the new immigration system.</p>

<p>EEA and Swiss trainees who arrive in the UK by 31 December 2020 can apply to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families" class="govuk-link">EU Settlement Scheme</a>. If successful, this will allow them to continue living, working and studying in the UK after 30 June 2021 without having to apply through the new points-based immigration system.</p>

<p>EEA and Swiss trainees who arrive in the UK from 1 January 2021 may need to apply for a visa through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know" class="govuk-link">new points-based immigration system</a>. In most cases, this will be a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#international-students-and-graduates">student visa</a> or if undertaking a salaried course, a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know#skilled-workers" class="govuk-link">skilled worker visa</a>. These visa routes require the educator/employer to sponsor the visa applicant. The educator/employer will need to have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-sponsor-licence" class="govuk-link">sponsor licence</a> to do this. State-funded schools cannot sponsor individuals on student visas.</p>

<h2>Changes to the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<h3>Meeting the GCSE equivalent standard or degree requirements</h3>

<p>We have temporarily relaxed C1.1 and C1.2 of the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria and amended the accompanying advice. This allows candidates who are not able to provide evidence of meeting the required GCSE equivalent standard or degree requirement before starting a course, due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, to start the course. To continue and complete the course, they must have provided evidence by 30 November 2020.</p>

<p>Details on assessment for GCSEs in summer 2021 are due to be confirmed after consultation in the spring term. In the meantime, candidates should speak to their chosen training provider to discuss their situation.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> courses starting from September 2020, we have also suspended the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expectation that trainees train to teach in at least 2 schools</li>
  <li>requirement for a trainee to have met the standards across the full age and ability range of training</li>
  <li>expectation that training programmes cover no fewer than 4 school years</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainees should receive training that is as complete as possible. You should only use these flexibilities when necessary. We expect you to assess trainees as fully meeting the Teachersâ Standards.</p>

<h3>Sufficient time in school to demonstrate the Teachersâ Standards</h3>

<p>C2.3 of the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria requires programmes to be designed to provide trainees with enough time in school to demonstrate that they have achieved all the Teachersâ Standards. It outlines the typical periods of time for training in schools, early years, or further education settings, but these are not mandatory. These typical periods of time are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice#c23-training-in-schools"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria and supporting advice</a>.</p>

<p>Consider how you will structure school placements for courses starting from September 2020. You should design your course to provide trainees with the time they need training in school to demonstrate the Teachersâ Standards. For most courses, this will typically be 120 days. In the event of disruption due to coronavirus (COVID-19), courses with fewer than 120 days physically in school are acceptable. This will not result in non-compliance in relation to C2.3 of the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria.</p>

<p>You should also consider the impact any further disruption would have on placements, such as the introduction in your area of any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/education-and-childcare">national coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-contingency-framework-for-education-and-childcare-settings">local restrictions on education settings</a>. You should have plans in place to introduce or extend provision of remote school-based training where required. For example, trainees could form part of schoolsâ plans to support remote education, through the use of video conferencing software, should pupils need to remain at home. You should facilitate and support trainees to undertake remote school-based training as you would in-school training.</p>

<p>We recognise that disruption due to coronavirus (COVID-19) may lead to discrepancies in the length and consistency of traineesâ school placement experience this year. Providers should use their professional judgement and discretion to determine the extent to which individual trainees have, through their school-based training, been able to evidence the Teachersâ Standards.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> setting/school placements toolkit, developed by sector experts with input from UCET, NASBTT and MillionPlus, was published in December 2020. The aim of the toolkit is to act as a helpful guide for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers, providing examples of how providers are approaching and delivering placements in the current coronavirus (COVID-19) context. The toolkit can be found on the UCET, NASBTT and MillionPlus websites.</p>

<h2>Legal requirements</h2>
<p>The arrangements set out under this section require amendments to regulation and are therefore subject to approval by Parliament. These amendments are scheduled to be laid before Parliament and come into force in Spring 2021. We will update the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-criteria/initial-teacher-training-itt-criteria-and-supporting-advice" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria and supporting advice</a> accordingly when the necessary amendments come into force.</p>

<h3>Practical teaching experience wholly or mainly in England</h3>

<p>Subject to approval by Parliament, <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers are permitted to allow trainees to undertake their practical teaching experience wholly or mainly outside England in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, if, for a reason related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, they are unable to do so wholly or mainly in England. Advice accompanying <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criterion C2.3 will be amended once the amendment comes into force.</p>

<h3>Recommendation for qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>We recognise there has been disruption to initial teacher training throughout the 2020 to 2021 academic year for reasons related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>We are aware that due to the varying restrictions imposed regionally, and the national lockdown measures introduced on 5 January 2021, there is variance in the disruption experienced by <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> trainees during the 2020 to 2021 academic year. Therefore, subject to approval by Parliament, <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers will be able to recommend trainees for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> if they are satisfied that the trainee has demonstrated adequate progress towards meeting the Teachersâ Standards during their course, and would have met them, were it not for disruption relating to coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers must continue to ensure <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> courses are as comprehensive as possible. Providers should only recommend trainees for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in this way where appropriate and necessary.</p>

<p><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers should not recommend for <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> those trainees that they deem have not yet been able to demonstrate adequate progress towards meeting the Teachersâ Standards. This may include trainees who will have had their time available to undertake practical teaching experience in schools significantly curtailed. We will continue to monitor the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on initial teacher training courses throughout the 2020 to 2021 academic year. Further guidance, including for those trainees deemed to have not made adequate progress towards meeting the Teachersâ Standards by the end of their course, will be provided in due course as appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> trainee consumer protection advice</h2>

<p><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> courses may include a blend of online teaching and in-person tuition as appropriate to minimise risk.</p>

<p>To help you make informed decisions about your provision, read:</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Universities should make sure continuing and prospective students receive clear, accurate and timely information needed to make informed decisions. This includes making them aware of any potential for changes at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>You will need to seek your own legal advice on whether the information you are providing is sufficient for them to do that.</p>

<h2>Support for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> in 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>We are offering expert <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> associate support for the 2020 to 2021 training year. This is to help you develop and deliver your courses considering partner school placement pressures and <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria relaxations.</p>

<p>You can get support in areas such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implementing the core content framework from September 2020</li>
  <li>Ofsted ITE Inspection Framework</li>
  <li>securing placements</li>
  <li>mentoring</li>
  <li>recruitment for 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers wishing to access this support should email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ITT.accreditation@education.gov.uk"><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>.accreditation@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>While associate capacity is limited, we will try to provide support for as many accredited <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers as possible.</p>

<h2>Critical workers</h2>

<p><abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> trainees, and students whose course contains an education studies element and who are on school placement, fall under the definition of âteaching and support staffâ and are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision">critical workers</a>.</p>

<p>Higher education teaching staff are critical workers where they are required to support students who are continuing their placements in person and cannot be supported remotely. This includes <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> tutors supporting trainees on placement.</p>

<h2>Assessment only</h2>

<p>We have relaxed the requirement for the assessment process to be completed within 12 consecutive weeks. The aggregate time spent on the route, discounting periods of interruption, should not exceed 12 weeks.</p>

<p>The regulations state a candidate should have undertaken a period of practical teaching experience, such that the person is assessed by the accredited institution as meeting the specified standards. Any providers managing prospective candidates should be mindful of this expectation.</p>

<p>Candidates cannot be given any additional allowance in terms of reduced assessments because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is because assessment only courses include no training so candidates cannot be deemed to be making adequate progress to meeting the standards.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-assessment-only-route-to-qts/assessment-only-route-to-qts-criteria-and-supporting-advice" class="govuk-link">assessment only criteria</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Academic qualifications</h2>

<p>Provision and assessment for the award of academic qualifications will be at the discretion of individual awarding bodies through existing arrangements.</p>

<h2>Undergraduate <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Try to adapt undergraduate programmes in the remaining years of the course. This will help give trainees the opportunity to demonstrate the standards across the full age and ability range of their training programme.</p>

<p>If youâre struggling to provide placement opportunities across the full age and ability range, consider redesignating your course. For example, a 3 to 11 course may be redesignated to a 5 to 11, or 3 to 7. The training must still take place across a minimum of 4 school years.</p>

<h2>Early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We have temporarily relaxed 1.1 and 1.2 of the early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> criteria and amended the accompanying advice.</p>

<p>This will allow candidates who are not able to provide evidence of meeting the required GCSE equivalent standard or degree requirement before starting a course, due to coronavirus (COVID-19), to start the course. To continue and complete the course, they must have provided evidence by 30 November 2020.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-itt-requirements-supporting-advice" class="govuk-link">early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> requirements and supporting advice</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Remote observations, moderation and assessment</h2>

<p>It is for <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers to agree with schools in their partnership if it is appropriate to remotely observe, assess and moderate traineesâ teaching in school.</p>

<p>They will need to come to an agreement that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respects the schoolâs policies</li>
  <li>is consistent with the partnership agreement</li>
  <li>meets safeguarding and data protection requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>It is acceptable for candidates on the Assessment Only (AO) route to be assessed remotely, provided that the assessment is rigorous and robust, supporting consistent and accurate judgements.</p>
