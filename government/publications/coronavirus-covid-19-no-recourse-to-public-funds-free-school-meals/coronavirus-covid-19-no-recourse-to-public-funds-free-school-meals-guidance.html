<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance will assist you to make a claim for additional pupil premium funding if both of the following criteria apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if at any time between 1 April 2020 and 7 October 2021 you had any pupils eligible for free school meals under the temporary extension granted to some children of groups who have no recourse to public funds (NRPF)</li>
  <li>these pupils were on the school roll on the date of the October census (7 October 2021)</li>
</ul>

<p>Claims can be submitted by: </p>

<ul>
  <li>primary, secondary and all through maintained schools, academies and free schools</li>
  <li>maintained special schools, and special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>independent special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Claims can be made at local authority, single and multi-academy trust as well as at individual institution-level.</p>

<p>Schools are expected to identify pupils who were eligible in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance/guidance-for-the-temporary-extension-of-free-school-meals-eligibility-to-nrpf-groups#who-is-eligible">the eligibility criteria</a>.</p>

<p>The pupils submitted in this claims process will also be eligible for recovery premium funding.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You must not make a claim for any pupils who do not meet the criteria or were not on the school roll on 7 October 2021.</p>
</div>

<p>These instructions are to help you complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/nrpf" rel="external">no recourse to public funds, free school meals additional pupil premium claim form</a>.</p>

<p>Claims can only be made by or on behalf of the eligible schools listed above.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Completing the form</h2>

<p>There is no save facility on the form so please have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-no-recourse-to-public-funds-free-school-meals/coronavirus-covid-19-no-recourse-to-public-funds-free-school-meals-guidance#before-you-start">all the information ready</a> before starting the sign-up process. If your form is open for an extended period, you may lose any information entered to that point and will need to sign in and re-enter this information again.</p>

<p>The form presents you with a question which allows you to submit a claim for additional pupil premium funding for pupils who have no recourse to public funds, meet the required criteria, who were eligible for free school meals between 1 April to 7 October 2021 and who were not counted as eligible for free school meals in the October 2021 census.

<p>You will be advised on what will happen next once you have submitted the form. Selecting ‘continue’ on each page will take you through the form.</p>

<h3>

The same will apply to multi academy trusts, where the details will show the name of the trust and the UID number.  You will be presented with a dropdown list of all the establishments in your organisation, including their names and URNs. Select an establishment and click continue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Submission</h3>
<p>You will be asked if you had any pupils on roll on 7 October 2021 who met the ‘No recourse to public funds’ criteria at any point between 1 April 2020 to 7 October 2021.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You should only include any pupils who were not recorded as eligible for free school meals in the October 2021 census.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>primary (reception to year 6 pupils or aged 4 to 10 when not following national curriculum year groups)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secondary (year 7 to 11 pupils or aged 11 to 15 when not following national curriculum year groups)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will then be taken to the summary page.</p>

<p>Checks will be made to ensure only eligible pupils are claimed for, in accordance with the eligibility criteria stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance/guidance-for-the-temporary-extension-of-free-school-meals-eligibility-to-nrpf-groups#who-is-eligible">published guidance on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h3>

Please check your answers before submitting your claim form. If you would like to change any answers, use the ‘change’ link that appears to the relevant data entry.</p>

<p>We will ask you to make several declarations.</p>
