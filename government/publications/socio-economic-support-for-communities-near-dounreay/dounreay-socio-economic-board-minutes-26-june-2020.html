<h4>Welcome and Introduction</h4>

<p>Steve Young welcomed everyone to the meeting. He noted that both Mark Rouse and Peter Faccenda were attending for the first time and introductions were made.</p>

<p>Before proceeding a safety share focussed on behaviours as the site begins to phase the restart of work on site.  David Wallace also highlighted the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> ‘make a change’ programme which centred on health and well-being.</p>

<p>Potential conflicts of interest were tabled, noting that no-one declaring an interest receives any personal benefit from these projects:</p>

<p>Steve Young summarised the focus, in relation to socio economics, had been on the impact to the community and local business during the COVID-19 restrictions. The current situation had influenced some of the decisions made over the last month and demonstrated the ability to make prompt decisions without compromising on due diligence.</p>

<p>He noted the funding provided to the North Highland Initiative (£30,000) to support community groups and to the Caithness Business Fund (£100,000) for local business support. The Caithness Business Fund requests had exceeded the funding provided and it was pleasing to see that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had agreed to match fund and provide a further £100k to allow the business fund to commence a second round.</p>

<p>He asked that members focus on two main topics at this meeting – the programme of activities for the nuclear partners to deliver, which would become part of the overall <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> programme, and also the funding application for the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub.</p>

<p>David Wallace noted that the Scottish Government had published an economic recovery report and there were some pointers in the paper that could be useful to consider as thinking evolved on support for COVID-19 recovery.   Simon Middlemas noted there were a lot of recommendations in the paper and these would clearly link into the Just Transition and climate actions.  He stated it was worth keeping abreast of these evolving pieces of work.</p>

<p>Steve Young noted that while local <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> connections were good it would be useful to consider how to get better connected with Scottish Government and other <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> partners on a regional basis.</p>

<h4>Apologies</h4>

<p>Apologies were received from John McNamara, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Head of Stakeholder Relations.</p>

<h4>Approval of previous minutes</h4>

<p>Steve Young noted that the minutes of the previous meeting had been circulated to members in advance – <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M02 refers. Following feedback amendments had been made. Members endorsed the minutes as a true reflection of the meeting.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A001 - June to publish minutes (<abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M02) on website by 2 July 2020.</p>

<h4>Status of actions</h4>

<p>The status of actions is recorded at the end of these minutes.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>  update</h4>
<p>Steve Young invited David Wallace to provide an update from <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>. David Wallace reported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had provided £100,000 to the Caithness Business Fund to support local business become COVID-19 compliant when re-opening.</li>
  <li>It was expected that the new <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> socio economic funding process would go live on 16th July.</li>
  <li>The <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Socio Economic Strategy was now nearing completion and was expected to be published next week.</li>
  <li>It was good to see that planning had been approved unanimously for Space Hub Sutherland.</li>
  <li>Stakeholder briefings would be issued on a monthly basis.</li>
  <li>Discussions with Skills Development Scotland (SDS) had taken place to explore how SDS could get more involved with <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> activities.</li>
  <li>David Peattie was meeting with Roseanna Cunningham (Scottish Government Minister) and Gail Ross, MSP next week.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> was supporting Wick Harbour to fund the procurement of a consultant to review and further develop the business plan for the proposed high-water gate.</li>
  <li>It was expected that some <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> personnel would start moving back into offices around 20 July.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steve Young noted that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had set up a new socio-economic panel meeting to evaluate all applications over £200,000. This would allow some consistency across the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> estate and he and June Love would be involved in these meetings.</p>

<p>Steve Young also noted that meetings between <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr>, <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> and <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had taken place on skills audits. <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> would be carrying out a site skills/technical competency audit as this was required for on-site purposes but would also be useful information externally. Parallel with this, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had committed to carrying out a wider skills audit for Caithness and North Sutherland and it had been agreed that these two pieces of work together would be useful input into <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> to translate the skills to nuclear requirements and other industries.</p>

<p>Simon Middlemas noted that he had completed a ‘medium’ <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> grant funding form and had found it quite hard to answer all the questions. Peter Faccenda echoed this and, while he understood information was required, he felt that some applicants would require support to complete these forms. David Wallace noted he would feedback these comments to <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>.</p>

<p>David Wallace noted that he had held internal discussions within the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> on a potential lead provided by Steve Young on a research project proposal with Liverpool University. <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> were keen to explore this further and suggested a follow up meeting with the university, <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> and <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to get more information on the proposal. Peter Faccenda stated that if this collaboration was to go ahead it would be worthwhile bringing in North Highland College to see how they could partner. Niall Watson stated that if this proposal was to be taken forward it would be important to collaborate on the research element of this.</p>

<h4>Dounreay update</h4>

<p>June Love noted that she had provided a written update and, given the desire to ensure the meeting devoted sufficient time to consider the application for a <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub, she would take this update as read unless members had any queries. Members were content to take the update as read.</p>

<p>June Love noted that a high level programme of nuclear partners’ activities had been developed. Members were asked to review the programme to ensure all activities were included and that the dates for delivery were achievable. This programme, when finalised, would allow the reporting of progress against deliverables at this meeting. When finalised it would also be provided to <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> to allow them to incorporate into the overall <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> socio economic programme.</p>

<p>Simon Middlemas stated that he had developed a template for dashboard reporting and this would also align to the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> programme. Steve Young agreed that the programme would provide a greater focus on delivery.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A002 - All members to review the high-level socio-economic programme, to ensure all activities are included and delivery dates are achievable, by 10 July 2020.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> funding applications</h4>

<p>Steve Young invited Peter Faccenda to provide a brief on the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> support hub funding application to allow members to consider whether this was something that could be supported. At this point, Simon Middlemas left the meeting and took no part in the discussion.</p>

<p>In summary, the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Executive Board had agreed to a refreshed approach for future <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> programme activity and this had allowed the development of a proposal to establish a <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub to provide some, and co-ordinate other, resources, expertise and support needed to help Caithness and north Sutherland organisations. The aims of the project were to aid rapid recovery from the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions and support future sustainability.</p>

<p>Peter Faccenda took members through the application form and the details of the proposal. The full discussion is recorded on the new <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> electronic system. Members, having questioned aspects of the application recommended that this funding application should be approved.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A003 - June Love to put the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub funding application and additional information into the new <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> socio economic application system by 1 July 2020.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A004 - June Love to draft letter of funding approval with conditions for Board comment/approval prior to being issued by 15 July 2020.</p>

<h4>Communications</h4>

<p>Paul Hetherington stated that there had been media coverage for a number of funding support projects during the month including the Caithness Business Fund, the North Highland Initiative fund and the provision of funding to purchase a motorbike to be based in Caithness for the Highlands and Islands Blood Bikes.</p>

<p>He also noted that the annual review for 2019/20 had been passed to the graphics department for design and was currently going through the document to finalise it.</p>

<h4>Any other business</h4>

<p>Steve Young invited the following to provide updates:</p>

<p>Off-site short-term accommodation strategy: Lesley Sewell reported that <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> was currently compiling data needed for the requirements for offsite accommodation. In parallel, while considering the short-term requirements, medium to longer term requirements were also being considered. Office space was being considered in Thurso and Wick with a facility in Thurso identified as a good potential as it is already had appropriate IT infrastructure and was therefore a relatively quick fix. She was also speaking with <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> in relation to the support provided to Sellafield for offsite accommodation.  She noted she had tried to contact Tony Smithers, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Property but had not managed to make contact. David Wallace said he would provide Lesley with Tony’s contact details.</p>

<p>Lesley Sewell also noted that there was two aspects to consider, the first being the site’s contractual arrangements and the potential to feed into another project that the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> was considering.</p>

<p>Simon Middlemas stated that it was good to see some short-term work being considered as this should ultimately feed into the longer term aspirations for off-site accommodation for beyond Dounreay.</p>

<p>Steve Young agreed that this piece of work could feed into long term solutions for office accommodation, which would enable further discussion with the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> around work mobility.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A005 - David Wallace to provide Lesley Sewell with contact details for Tony Smithers, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Property by 1 July 2020.</p>

<p><abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> Terms of Reference: June Love noted she had distributed the latest Terms of Reference following comment at the last meeting.  These had been circulated so that they could be agreed and finalised. Steve Young noted that objectives had been identified and consideration would be required as to how to measure success against these objectives.</p>

<p>Action: DESB(2020)M03/A006 - All <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> members to provide final comment to June Love on the Terms of Reference by 15 July 2020.</p>

<p>Partnering charter/maturity model: Steve Young noted that discussion had been deferred from the last meeting and questioned the need for a partnering charter. Simon Middlemas said that the partnering charter, signed in 2012, made some bold statements. In the context of measuring success for the <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> objectives this could be done by carrying out a partnering maturity model survey which allows members to consider and score where they believe the nuclear partners currently stand and then to repeat this a year later to ensure improvement.</p>

<p>Niall Watson stated he had looked at the maturity model and asked whether this was something for all <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> partners or for the nuclear partners only. Simon Middlemas responded that he felt this is something that the nuclear partners should do and then it would roll out to the wider <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr>.</p>

<p>Peter Faccenda felt this approach was effectively based on what <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> could look like with the right partnership support. He believed this was something that he would like to use to engage <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> partners.</p>

<p>David Wallace felt the maturity model would be useful to bring the partners together and provided a good opportunity to consider the effectiveness of partners.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the partnering maturity model would be circulated to all <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> members for completion and following that it would be rolled out to <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> partners.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A007 - June Love to provide partnering maturity model survey for members to complete and follow up with 1:1 discussions with Peter Faccenda.</p>

<p>Niall Watson asked whether it would be possible to explain the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub in a single page. It was agreed that Paul Hetherington would work with Peter Faccenda to produce a one page summary.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2020)M03/A008 - Peter Faccenda and Paul Hetherington to work up a single page summary describing the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Support Hub by 28 July 2020.</p>

<p>Paul Hetherington asked what progress was being made on the Public Service Obligation (PSO) for Wick/JOG airport.  Peter Faccenda responded that Eastern Airways had recently announced it would not be restarting flights to/from Aberdeen and because of this there was more urgency around the setting up of a PSO.  Transport Scotland was considering the business case and there had been robust discussions with Scottish Government Ministers.</p>

<p>Mark Rouse noted he had been observing the majority of the meeting as this was his first one since returning as <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> Managing Director.  He stated he would reflect on the meeting and would follow up initial thoughts off-line to bring himself up to speed as there was a lot to take on board.</p>

<p>There being no further business, Steve Young thanked everyone for attending and formally closed the meeting.</p>

<p>Steve Young (Chair), Organisational Excellence Director, 28 June 2020</p>
