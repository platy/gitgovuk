<h4>Welcome and introductions</h4>

<p>Martin Moore welcomed everyone to the meeting and noted that Lesley Sewell, Business Director had replaced David Lowe (former Deputy Managing Director) on the board.</p>

<p>Safety share: Martin Moore invited members to raise a safety share. June Love stated that it would be prudent to remember that with the sunny weather recently it was important to ensure that you were protected against the sun. Martin Moore noted that in addition to this it was useful to consider heat stress assessments especially when carrying out work in areas where the heat could cause issues.</p>

<p>Conflicts of Interest: Martin Moore requested all members to raise any potential conflicts of interest. The following was noted:</p>

<h4>Approval of previous minutes</h4>

<p>Martin Moore noted that all members had received copies of the last minutes – <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M001 – in advance of the meeting. It was agreed that the minutes were a true reflection of the meeting and were approved.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A001 - June Love to finalise DESB(2019)M001 and publish on website.</p>

<h4>Status of actions</h4>

<p>The following actions were noted as ongoing:</p>

<p><abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M001/A002 - Anna MacConnell to continue to progress a response to the potential front-loading of the Dounreay Socio Economic budget and report back as soon as a response has been provided by the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Executive. Action ongoing:  This needs further local discussion, as it is a question for <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> as to whether they would be able to  front-load their socio-economic budget within the existing annual site funding level (ASFL).</p>

<p>It was noted that the front-loading had been discussed due to an application from Scrabster Harbour Trust for £1.35m from <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr>, which exceeded the £500k annual budget for socio economics. Given the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had committed £5m (which included the £1.35m requested from Dounreay) there were no active applications which would require the front-loading of the budget at this time. It was noted however that there was a peak of funding required for Caithness and North Sutherland Partnership (<abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr>) projects during 2019/20 to 2021/22. It was agreed that front loading from the site’s annual budget would not be possible given that any additional funding for socio economics would impact on decommissioning activities.</p>

<p>Niall Watson noted that the carry-over of any underspend of socio economic funding was, in effect, a virtual carry-over, as any carry-over spent during the following financial year would have to be accommodated within the overall site decommissioning budget (Annual Site Funding Limit). He felt that, if a good project came forward, there should be scope for the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to allow <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> to accrue and administer unspent socio-economic funding without it being constrained by the ASFL. Mark Raffle said any projects coming forward would be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>DESB(2019)M001/A006: Anna MacConnell to provide an update at next <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> meeting on the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> Executive decision on socio economic funding for Caithness and North Sutherland. Action ongoing: An announcement was made at the end of March relating to £5m grant funding to support Scrabster Harbour Trust with the redevelopment of the St Ola Pier. An outcome from the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> is awaited on two other projects that have resulted in requests for <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> funding of around £11m.</p>

<p>The remaining actions were all completed and these are recorded at the end of this minute.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> update</h4>

<p>There was no written report from <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>. Mark Raffle noted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The recent announcement of £5M grant funding to support Scrabster Harbour Trust to redevelop the St Ola Pier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simon Middlemas asked whether there was a reason that the Board and <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> were not provided with advance notice before the announcement was made public.</p>

<p>Mark Raffle said he was not aware of the timeline of briefings regarding these announcements and would ask Anna MacConnell to outline the protocol for communications for such announcements.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A002 - Mark Raffle to speak to Anna MacConnell to request an outline of the protocol for communications of <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> socio economic funding announcements.</p>

<p>Martin Moore expressed concern  that the majority of Board members were unware of this announcement in advance however the funding provided from the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> was welcomed by the Board.</p>

<p>June Love noted that the application from Scrabster Harbour Trust for <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> funding of £1.35m was now superseded and therefore a letter would be provided to Scrabster Harbour Trust to close out this application.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A003 - June Love to write to Scrabster Harbour Trust to close out existing funding application for support to the redevelopment of the St Ola Pier.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Cavendish Dounreay Partnership">CDP</abbr> update</h4>

<p>Simon Middlemas noted the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Executive Board meeting: At the last Executive meeting, there had been a strategy discussion with agreement on the priority projects for the next three years. He provided a quick update on all priority and enabling projects on the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> programme. He also noted that confirmation was awaited as to whether Bill Hamilton, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> would remain on this group given his recent appointment as the Magnox Communications Director.</li>
  <li>CN Engineering Hub: Discussions are continuing with the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> to seek approval to commence a 2 year desk top study to inform the business case.</li>
  <li>Sustainability: This had been raised by Simon Middlemas at the last <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Delivery Group and others around potential regional implementation. It was still at a very early stage in discussion with <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr>, Caithness Chamber of Commerce and others, but there was growing interest but, as yet, no current ask of anyone. He agreed to provide update to the DESB as this project progressed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> update</h4>
<p>June Love noted that she had provided a written update for the meeting. She noted the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>During 2018/19, <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> carried out an internal audit across its estate relating to socio economic funding. The audit report had been received and the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> had produced a management response outlining improvements that will be made to the process. The <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> socio economic funding was part of the audit with a couple of minor issues reported. At present all SLCs were awaiting guidance from <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> and a new funding application form which will be consistent across the estate is under development. Once the guidance is provided the <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> process will be considered to ensure it reflects the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> guidance whilst ensuring it is fit-for-purpose for local needs.</li>
  <li>The Dounreay Socio Economic Plan for 2019/20-2022/23 was submitted to <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> at the end of March 2019. A draft of the document was also presented at the DSG socio economic sub group with no substantive comments received. A response from the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> is awaited.</li>
  <li>A Socio Economic Review 2018/19 providing information on all nuclear partner socio economic activities has now been completed.</li>
  <li>In 2018/19, <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> provided grant funding to the Chamber of Commerce to develop evidence for a Public Service Obligation at Wick/JOG airport. The purpose of this study was intended to prompt discussion and reflection regarding air services into and out of the airport with the overall aim to enhance the appropriateness and speed of any public sector response to address any further reductions in air services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report has now been finalised and early discussion has commenced on communicating the results of the findings with key stakeholders. One of the activities identified was to reach out to local businesses in the area to explore whether they could underwrite a number of seats for flights, particularly if these could demonstrate an overall saving to the business, e.g. if timetabling would allow business to be conducted on a day return. <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> would be approached to consider this. It was agreed that June Love would provide the full report to Lesley Sewell who would consider this with respect to <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Niall Watson felt that if flights from Wick/JOG airport were timetabled to allow for day returns or quicker connection times this could potentially show travel time savings. Factors in determining whether this would be of business benefit to <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> would include the comparative costs of flying from Wick compared to other options, the reliability of service and whether this would reduce the need for overnight stays and therefore time out of the office. Mark Raffle agreed saying it would have to demonstrate a good business benefit. Martin Moore asked whether marketing was being undertaken. June Love noted that there were a number of stakeholder activities to be undertaken and these were being identified at present. Niall Watson stated that marketing had been undertaken to an extent but provided the effort expended by <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> was not disproportionate it would be useful to provide input into this study in terms of data for <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> travel.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A004 - Lesley Sewell to consider the findings of the full PSO report and explore whether <abbr title="Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd">DSRL</abbr> (and <abbr title="Cavendish Dounreay Partnership">CDP</abbr>) could support the potential underpinning of seats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All approved funding commitments for this financial year were summarised in the written update. There were no issues currently with delivering funding conditions.</li>
  <li>Funding application: One funding application had been received via <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> requesting half funding for an Economic Impact Assessment for the North Coast 500.</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Moore asked where this fitted with the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Programme. June Love stated that this would seek to identify a new baseline to inform strategy and options assessment to identify where <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> partners could support. Other observations provided by the Board included:</p>

<p>It was not clear how this information will support the identification of the scope of work for the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> NC500 project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It would be useful to understand what outputs would result from this study.</li>
  <li>Whether <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr>/HIE could identify, in terms of enterprise, where the potential gaps were.</li>
  <li>This could be considered as a day job for HIE (and once delivered could potentially provide useful information for <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> to identify a workstream on the programme).</li>
  <li>Whether the proposal could not have involved the use of a local (Caithness / Sutherland or Highlands) organisation to undertake the EIA.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was agreed that further explanations were required to respond to the comments above and to also explain how and where this fitted in with the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> programme. It was agreed that these comments would be passed back to the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Programme Manager to respond to.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A005 - June Love to provide <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> comments to <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Programme Manager on the funding application for an EIA for North Coast 500.</p>

<p>It was further agreed that it would be appropriate to invite the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Chair and Programme Manager to the next <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> in order to meet with Board members.</p>

<p>Action: <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>(2019)M002/A006 - June Love to invite <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> Chair and Programme Manager (and Chair if available) to attend the next <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commercial Department had begun to collate information regarding the socio economic benefit from sub-contractors. Discussions between Commercial Department and contractor organisations were underway as to the socio economic plans submitted within tenders for the decommissioning services framework contracts and how these would be measured.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Communications</h4>

<p>Paul Hetherington noted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Dounreay Socio Economic Annual Review 2018/19 had been produced and would be published shortly.  The information contained within the report would allow for a series of social media reports via Facebook, twitter and would feature in the mini films around the company values.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Any other business</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Niall Watson stated that, in relation to the earlier discussion on sustainability, as an environmental professional this was something he welcomed and felt had potential. He noted that as the <abbr title="Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership">CNSRP</abbr> currently has a series of criteria to assess how funding applications align with high priority areas it would be worth considering how the criteria would need to be modified to accommodate sustainability. Simon Middlemas responded that the four pillars would be considered and felt that many projects/businesses already considered sustainability factors in their everyday business.</li>
  <li>Niall Watson noted that at the last <abbr title="Dounreay Socio Economic Board">DSEB</abbr> meeting he had indicated that Jamie Stone MP had invited senior <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr> officials to a meeting he was organising with the unions on the socio economics of the far north. The unions had recently been informed that a date had been agreed with the <abbr title="Nuclear Decommissioning Authority">NDA</abbr>, only to find out shortly afterwards that a new date would need to be sought.</li>
</ul>

<p>There being no further business, Martin Moore thanked everyone for their input and formally closed the meeting.</p>
