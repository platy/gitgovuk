<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Context</h2>

<p>Certain articles of the Single Use Plastic Directive (the Directive) were added to Annex II of the Northern Ireland Protocol in December 2020. Article 7 of the Directive requires tobacco manufacturers to include a marking on the packaging of tobacco products containing plastic to indicate this to consumers.</p>

<p>The Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association (<abbr title="Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association">TMA</abbr>) have expressed their concern that they will not be able to comply with the Article 7 requirements due to the existing Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015. Therefore, officials met with industry representatives to discuss this issue.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Rupert Lewis (<abbr title="Rupert Lewis">RL</abbr>) sympathised with the challenges the government faced with the Northern Ireland Protocol and noted that the issue of where to put the marking has been central to the <abbr title="Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association">TMA</abbr>’s members since at least spring 2021.</p>

<p>Lottie Free (<abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr>) thanked <abbr title="Rupert Lewis">RL</abbr> and others for their patience and emphasised that the government is aware of this issue and working to resolve it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Discussion of solution</h2>

<p><abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> asked whether the marking could be accommodated if rotated 90° and put on the side of the packet (as indicated by the Implementing Regulation as an alternative to the marking being placed on the back of packs). Several points were then raised.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Moving the fiscal mark</h3>

<p>Jamie Sanders (<abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr>) asked whether conversations had been held with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about moving the fiscal mark. <abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> confirmed that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> would not agree to this option.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Position of barcode</h3>

<p><abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> said placing the marking on the side of the packet left limited space to put the barcode. <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> also noted they would need to inform retailers that the barcode had moved. Stephen Little (<abbr title="Stephen Little">SL</abbr>) said that there would be no space on his company’s packets to include the barcode if it was not on the side of packets. <abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> acknowledged that different companies would have slightly different packaging and requested all parties explored whether placing the marking on the side of the packet was possible and send <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> mock-ups, for example.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Stickers</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> flagged that the implementing regulation allows for the marking to be attached as stickers until July 2022 and asked if this would help in the interim. <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> explained stickers would not work well as a temporary solution, as the regulation required the sticker to go under the wrapping. Industry would have to unwrap all packets to place the sticker or put on a second wrapping. <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> said that neither are practical options. <abbr title="Stephen Little">SL</abbr> agreed that stickers would prove burdensome.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Placed on the market</h3>

<p><abbr title="Stephen Little">SL</abbr> asked whether discussions about the definition of ‘placed on the market’ had taken place. Philip McMurray (<abbr title="Philip McMurray">PM</abbr>) said that if a purchase or transaction to purchase have taken place, the product is considered to have been placed on the market.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Hand-rolling tobacco</h3>

<p><abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> said that his company sold packets of hand-rolling tobacco that contained filters inside. These would also require the mark, which leads to a similar issue. <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> said that the implementing regulation did not appear to take into account the requirements for this type of product. <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> suggested the marking could go under the pouch. Following a question from <abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr>, <abbr title="Jamie Sanders">JS</abbr> said the only EU Member State his company sold these products in did not have plain packaging requirements, so the issue did not arise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Timings</h3>

<p><abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> noted the challenge in meeting the 1 January 2022 deadline for these changes to be implemented.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>On behalf of the members of the Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association, <abbr title="Rupert Lewis">RL</abbr> noted the short timeline to 1 January 2022 and thanked officials for this conversation. <abbr title="Rupert Lewis">RL</abbr> will consult with members and provide additional information requested. <abbr title="Lottie Free">LF</abbr> thanked all for attending and said any information would be helpful.</p>
