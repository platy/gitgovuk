<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State for Education lays down the following terms and conditions on which assistance is given in relation to the Homes for Ukraine scheme’s education and childcare funding payable to local authorities for the financial year beginning 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The rates and detailed eligibility criteria for the financial year 2022 to 2023 are set out in section 2 below.</p>

<p>Grants will be allocated under section 14 of the Education Act 2002 with the condition that local authorities in England can spend the funding on provision of services for children who have entered via the Homes for Ukraine visa route.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Provision of services for children who have entered via the Homes for Ukraine visa route</h3>

<p>The funding must only be used for the provision of education and childcare for children ages 2 to 18 who have entered via the Homes for Ukraine visa route, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to provide a place for 2, 3 and 4-year-olds accessing the 2-year-old, universal or 30 hours entitlements</li>
  <li>the provision of a suitable place for all other children up to the age of 18 (including time for staff resource and travel)</li>
  <li>funding placement of larger clusters of children into schools and early years settings, including the costs of additional and specialist teaching, non-teaching and administrative staff</li>
  <li>providing suitable travel arrangements, where necessary, to facilitate a child’s attendance at school or suitable education setting</li>
  <li>the provision of specialist and bespoke services, such as support for children with additional needs, and resources (this may include education materials for schools)</li>
  <li>free school meals and school uniform (including school bags, provisions for example, water bottles, etc.)</li>
  <li>to provide access to extra-curricular activities for example, sports</li>
  <li>on community services whose provision benefits the children</li>
  <li>any other reasonable costs associated with the provision of education and childcare for the children.</li>
</ul>

<p>The local authority can pool any amount of funding to fund activities that will benefit a group or all of the authority’s children received via the Homes for Ukraine visa route.</p>

<p>For any funding that is passed on to the child’s education or childcare setting, processes for allocating the funds should be as simple as possible to avoid delay.</p>

<p>Local authorities may allocate funding to independent schools and independent special schools or spend the funding themselves on additional educational support to raise the attainment for the eligible pupils. Local authorities must consult schools about how to use funding to support eligible pupils.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Allocation and payment arrangements</h2>

<p>We have published allocations in August 2022 for all local authorities that have children via the Homes for Ukraine visa route who arrived between March 2022 and May 2022. Payments will be made for each child based upon the data entry point following quarterly data collections administered by Department for Levelling Up, Homes and Communities (DLUHC), with payments calculated on a pro-rata basis.</p>

<p>The per pupil amounts include support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).</p>

<p>The department will make regular payments to local authorities based on data collections each covering 3 months of the programme. Allocations will include arrivals from the previous quarter once the data has been validated. The first data collection was for March 2022 to May 2022.  We will endeavour to make payments to local authorities the month following the data collections and will publish the allocations for each local authority.</p>

<p>The first payment, made in August 2022, was a payment in arrears to cover one-quarter of the annual tariff for the arrivals in the authority in the time period 1 March 2022 to 31 May 2022. The remaining payment of three-quarters of the annual tariff (to cover the subsequent 9 months) will be made alongside the payment for arrivals in quarter 2. All future payments after the first quarter will provide the total amount of pro-rata funding per child for the 2022 to 2023 financial year. Payment amounts are based on the age of the child on the date he or she arrives in the authority. The allocation of funding for each phase of education is:</p>

<p>Local authorities must make the funding available to their schools irrespective of any deficit relating to the expenditure of the school’s budget share. This funding is not part of schools’ budget shares and is not part of the individual school’s budget. It is not to be counted for the purpose of calculating the minimum funding guarantee.</p>

<p>If a local authority receives a funding allocation for a child living in their area, but being educated in another area, we expect the local authority to passport an appropriate amount to the local authority in which the maintained school or academy trust is providing the school place.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>&nbsp;Carrying forward Homes for Ukraine education and childcare funding</h2>

<p>Local authorities and schools are not required to spend all of the funding they receive in the financial year beginning 1 April 2022; some or all of it may be carried forward to future financial years. Any funding that is carried forward must be used in accordance with the conditions of grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>&nbsp;Certification</h2>

<p>Local authorities will be required to certify that they have passed on the correct amount of funding to schools or, where funding has been spent centrally, that it has been spent in line with these conditions of grant. We will issue a certification form in April 2023.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>&nbsp;Variation</h2>

<p>The basis for the allocation of education and childcare funding for Homes for Ukraine children may be varied from those set out above by the Secretary of State, if so requested by the school or local authority. Any variation will be at the sole discretion of ESFA/DfE.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>&nbsp;Other terms</h2>

<p>If the local authority fails to comply with the terms set out in the paragraphs above, the Secretary of State may withhold all or part of subsequent instalments paid to the authority.</p>

<p>This will be notified in writing to the local authority. Any such sum shall be withheld from subsequent instalments of the Homes for Ukraine education and childcare funding.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>&nbsp;Overpayments</h2>

<p>Any overpayment of Homes for Ukraine education and childcare funding shall be repaid by the school or local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>&nbsp;Further information</h2>

<p>Books and other documents and records relating to the recipient’s accounts shall be open to inspection by the Secretary of State and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General may, under section 6 of the National Audit Act 1983, carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the recipient has used its resources in discharging its grant-aided activities.</p>

<p>Schools and local authorities shall provide information as may be required by the Secretary of State to determine whether they have complied with these conditions.</p>

<p>Failure to provide this information may result in the Secretary of State withholding subsequent instalments of the Homes for Ukraine education and childcare funding.</p>
