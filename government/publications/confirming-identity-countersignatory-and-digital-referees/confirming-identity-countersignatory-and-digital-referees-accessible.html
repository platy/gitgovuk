<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

<p>HM Passport Office guidance about who can confirm a customer’s identity and how they do this.</p>

<h2>About: Confirming ID: countersignatory and digital referees</h2>

<p>This guidance tells HM Passport Office staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>about the purpose of a person who confirms a customer identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the criteria to be a person, who confirms a customer’s identity,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when staff may use discretion (when examining a person who confirms a customer identity)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Contacts</h3>

<p>If you have any questions about the guidance and your line manager or senior caseworker cannot help you or you think that the guidance has factual errors then email Guidance &amp; Quality, Operating Standards.</p>

<p>If you notice any formatting errors in this guidance (broken links, spelling mistakes and so on) or have any comments about the layout or navigability of the guidance then you can email Guidance &amp; Quality, Operating Standards.</p>

<h3>Publication</h3>

<p>Below is information on when this version of the guidance was published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>version 1.0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>published for Home Office staff on 29 June 2021</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes from last version of this guidance</h3>

<p>This document forms part of HM Passport Office’s guidance transformation. The content has been taken from the Digital referee and Countersignatures guidance, which have been split between this guidance and Countersignatory: how to examine and Digital referee: how to examine.</p>

<h2>Why we need a countersignatory or digital referee</h2>

<p>This page tells HM Passport Office staff, why we have a person to confirm a customer’s identity when they apply for a British passport and when we need a person to confirm a customer’s identity.</p>

<p>A person who confirms a customer’s identity and countersigns their passport application, are an important part of the passport application process. That person is called a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>countersignatory, if they completed a paper SE04 or OS application form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>digital referee, if they use the Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We ask them to confirm the customer’s photo is a true likeness and corroborate (countersign) their personal details on the passport application. A person who countersigns a customer’s passport application helps us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm a customer’s identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that the information given by the customer is true (to the best of their knowledge)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain the integrity of the British passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safeguard (protect) vulnerable customers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To help us identify and prevent fraud we will complete standard identity checks to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check the identity of the person confirming a customer’s identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the identity of the customer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When we need a countersignatory</h3>

<p>If a customer is applying for a British passport using a paper SE04 or OS application form, we ask them to provide a countersignatory, when they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>apply for their first adult passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>replace their adult passport that has been damaged, lost or stolen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renew their adult passport and their appearance has changed or we cannot recognise them from their current passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>apply for a child’s first passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renew a child passport (for children under the age of 11)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>replace a child passport that has been damaged, lost or stolen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>renew a child passport (for children aged 12 to 15) if their appearance has changed or we cannot recognise them from their current passport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When we need a digital referee</h3>

<p>The Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel tells a customer when they apply if they must provide us with a digital referee to confirm their identity (see: Digital Customer Service guidance).</p>

<p>A customer knows if they need a digital referee because, DCS will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask them to select one (to confirm their identity)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tell them who can be a digital referee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a digital referee is provided, you (the examiner) must examine them even if you feel you can identify the customer from the old passport.</p>

<h2>Who can confirm a customer’s identity</h2>

<p>This page tells HM Passport Office staff about the criteria to be a person who can confirm a customer’s identity.</p>

<p>A countersignatory or digital referee (the person confirming a customer’s identity), must be a person of ‘good standing’ in the community and someone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>has personally known the customer for at least 2 years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>works in a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark14">recognised profession</a> (or who has retired from one)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>will lose something, if they falsely countersign an application (for example, it will have a negative impact on their life if they made a false declaration)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has a passport we can use to check their identity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Countersignatory: who can confirm an identity</h3>

<p>Countersignatories who sign (to confirm a customer’s identity using a paper SE04 or OS application form):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a UK application must live in the UK and hold an uncancelled British or current Irish passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an overseas application must hold (in order of preference):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>an uncancelled British passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a current Irish passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a current European Union passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a current United States passport</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a current Commonwealth passport</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital referee: who can confirm an identity online</h3>

<p>Digital referees can confirm a customer’s identity on a Digital Customers Services (DCS) application online, if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are 18 years old or over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live in the UK (for UK or overseas applications)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live outside of the UK (overseas applications only)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have an unexpired</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>British passport that is on Main Index (UK applications)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>British (that is on Main Index), <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark41">Irish, European Union, United States or Commonwealth passport</a> (overseas applications only)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can pass our <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark12">automatic identity checks</a> (if completed)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the digital referee cannot complete the online process, we will tell the customer to ask someone else to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the online process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fill the 1-page countersignatory form, if they cannot find someone suitable to complete the online process</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Automatic identity checks</h4>

<p>If a digital referee completes the DCS application online, they agree for us to run automatic identity checks on the information they give.</p>

<h3>Digital referee: who can confirm an identity offline</h3>

<p>A customer can provide a digital referee ‘offline’, using a 1-page (paper) countersignatory form, if their digital referee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>does not meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark9">online criteria</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lives in the UK (for UK or overseas application)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lives outside of the UK (overseas applications only)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has a current:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>British or Irish passport (UK applications)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>British, <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark40">Irish, European Union, United States or Commonwealth passport</a> (overseas applications only)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cannot pass our <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark12">automatic identity checks</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Civil service staff confirming a customer’s identity</h4>

<p>Civil servants are a recognised profession to countersign an application. However, if a civil servant provides a service on behalf of HM Passport Office, they are not acceptable. For example, they are working as part of a surge team at the time of the customer’s application.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, must refer an application to your operational team leader (OTL), if the customer’s identity has been confirmed, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HM Passport Office staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UK Visas and Immigration staff dealing with applications for British citizenship or right of abode in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>someone who is providing a service on behalf of HM Passport Office, from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>HM Revenue and Customs</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Local Service or Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) (unless the application is from a prisoner held overseas and they have personal knowledge of the individual)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the Home Office, for example a member of the Passport or Nationality Policy team</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>UK Visas and Immigration</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above are a countersignatory or digital referee on a British passport application, you, the OTL, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>speak to the member of staff’s line manager to find out why they countersigned the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reject them as a countersignatory or digital referee, and ask the customer for a new one</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are the OTL dealing with the member of staff who has acted as a countersignatory or digital referee on a British passport application, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider whether you need to follow disciplinary procedures in line with the HR personal conduct guidance (for example, if they have been told before they must not countersign)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect fraud, you must refer the member of staff to the HO Security Central Referrals team who will refer them to the Professional Standards Unit (PSU).</p>

<h4>Supplier staff confirming a customer’s identity</h4>

<p>If a person works for our supplier, Sopra Steria Ltd. and provide a service on behalf of HM Passport Office, they are not acceptable. For example, they are working as part of the Document Management Service (DMS) at the time of the customer’s application.</p>

<p>If they have confirmed a customer’s identity, you, the examiner, must reject them as a countersignatory or digital referee, and ask the customer for a new one</p>

<p>You may accept a person who works for a partner organisation (for example Post Office and Royal Mail) if they meet the criteria to countersign an application. This is because they are not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>able to influence the outcome of an application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are not at the same risk of being sought out by criminals</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>How a person confirms a customer’s identity</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff, how a person confirms a customer’s identity when they are applying for a British passport.</p>

<p>A person who meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark9">criteria to confirm a customer’s identity</a> can countersign the customer’s application (for example, length of time they have known the customer).</p>

<h3>Confirm an identity using a paper application form</h3>

<p>A person confirming a customer identity using a paper SE04 or OS application form is called a countersignatory.</p>

<p>A countersignatory must be able to confirm the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>customer’s identity and photo is a true likeness, by <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">signing the back of 1 photo</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information the customer gives on the application is true and correct, to the best of their knowledge</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The person confirming a child’s identity (for their application), must be able to confirm the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identity of the person making the application on the child’s behalf</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identity of the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relationship between the person making the application and the child</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a third party makes an application on the customer’s behalf, we ask the person confirming the customer’s identity to confirm the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identity of the third party that is making the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identity of the person who the passport is for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relationship between the third party and the customer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How a countersignatory fills in an application</h4>

<p>A countersignatory must complete section ten of the paper application form after the customer has completed all the other sections. We will ask the countersignatory to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>give their full name, full address, profession and contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give their current passport number</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give the years they have known the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>give the date they signed the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sign inside the box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>put their initials next to any mistakes they may make</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How a countersignatory confirms a customer’s photo</h4>

<p>The certification (signature) on the back of the photo must confirm the photo is a true likeness of the person named and match the name on the customer’s application.</p>

<p>A countersignatory must sign 1 of the photos the customer sends with their application. On the back of the photo, the countersignatory must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>write a statement to say: ‘I certify that this is a true likeness of Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms or title [full name of customer]’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sign and date it (under the statement)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For legal reasons, we must not accept ‘true likeness’ certifications on a separate piece of paper, even if it’s attached to the back of a photo.</p>

<h3>Confirm an identity using the Digital Customer Service</h3>

<p>A person confirming a customer identity using the Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel is called a digital referee.</p>

<p>We use 2 types of digital referees, these are online and offline digital referees. A digital referee can confirm a customer’s application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>online (digitally)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>offline (using a 1-page countersignatory paper form)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A digital referee must be able to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a customer’s identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an intended passport holder’s identity (child and third party applications)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the questions they answer about the customer are true (to the best of their knowledge)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The questions we ask a digital referee, helps us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm a customer’s identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm an intended passport holder’s identity (child and third party applications)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>prevent passport fraud</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain the integrity of the British passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safeguard (protect) vulnerable customers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You (the examiner) must examine the digital referee if there is one provided on the customer’s application.</p>

<h4>Digital referee: confirming an adult’s application</h4>

<p>A digital referee on an adult application, must confirm the customer’s identity by checking their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark24">photo (for example, if it is a true likeness</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark25">address</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Digital referee: confirming a photo is a true likeness</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee a photo of the customer and ask them to confirm if it is a true likeness of the person named on the application. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process using the 1-page countersignatory form, they are asked to sign the declaration to confirm the photo is a true likeness of the customer.</p>

<p>There are 4 reasons why a digital referee may not be able to confirm if the photo is a true likeness:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise the photo but not the customer’s name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know a person by that name but cannot identify the customer from the photo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise the photo but know the customer by another name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not know the customer’s name and do not recognise their photo</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>Digital referee: confirming a customer’s address</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee the customer’s address and ask them to confirm if it’s correct. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process using the 1-page countersignatory form, they are asked to sign the declaration to confirm the customer’s address.</p>

<h4>Digital referee: confirming a child’s application</h4>

<p>The purpose of a digital referee on a child’s application is to confirm details, about the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relationship between the customer and the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>child’s link to the address on the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DCS asks the digital referee to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark27">the parents’ details</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">if a child’s photo is a true likeness</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark29">the customer’s address (and the child’s link to it</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark30">if the person making the child’s application has the right authority</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark31">the child’s place of birth</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Digital referee: confirming the parents’ details</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee the details of the child’s parents and ask them to confirm if they are correct. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process offline, they confirm the parents’ details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they sign the declaration on the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in their response to AMS letter 920</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you (the examiner) must contact the digital referee if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">no response to the additional questions</a> in AMS letter 920</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are 3 reasons why a digital referee may not be able to confirm the identity of the child’s parents:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The referee has no knowledge of or are unable to confirm either parent.</li>
  <li>One of the parent’s details are missing.</li>
  <li>The parents’ details are incorrect (for example, their name).</li>
</ol>

<h5>Digital referee: confirm a child’s photo is a true likeness</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee a photo of the child and ask them to confirm if it’s a true likeness of the person. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process offline, they confirm the photo is a true likeness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they sign the declaration on the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in their response to AMS letter 920</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you (the examiner) must contact the digital referee if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">no response to the additional questions</a> in AMS letter 920</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are 4 reasons why a digital referee may not be able to confirm if a photo is a true likeness of a child. For example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise the photo but not the child’s name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They know a child by that name but cannot identify the child in the photo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They recognise the photo but know the child by another name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not know the name of the child and do not recognise the photo.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>Digital referees: confirming a child’s address</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee the customer’s address and ask them to confirm if it’s correct and if the child is linked to it. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process offline, they confirm the customer’s address and the child’s link to if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they sign the declaration on the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in their response to AMS letter 920</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you (the examiner) must contact the digital referee if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">no response to the additional questions</a> in AMS letter 920</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Digital referee: confirming a person applying for a child</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee the details of the person making the application for a child and will ask them to confirm if they are responsible for the child. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process offline, they confirm the person making the application has parental responsibility for the child:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they sign the declaration on the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in their response to AMS letter 920</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you (the examiner) must contact the digital referee if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">no response to the additional questions</a> in AMS letter 920</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons why a digital referee may not be able to confirm the person making the application, has parental responsibility for the child, can be because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>do not know the person making the application and their link to the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do not know or believe the person making the application has parental responsibility for the child</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with a child application, you (the examiner) must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>look at the details of the person making the child application, to confirm if they are responsible for the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the documents the customer has provided support the child application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Digital referee: confirming a child’s place of birth</h5>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process online, DCS will show the digital referee the child’s place of birth and ask them to confirm if it’s correct. The digital referee will answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’, if they answer ‘no’, they must provide a reason why using the free text box.</p>

<p>If the digital referee completes the process offline, they confirm the child’s place of birth:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if they sign the declaration on the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in their response to AMS letter 920</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you (the examiner) must contact the digital referee if you have <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">no response to the additional questions</a> in AMS letter 920</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 reasons why a digital referee may not be able to confirm a child’s place of birth, including when they:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do not know the child’s place of birth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know the child was not born in that location.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to check a person confirming an identity is acceptable</h2>

<p>This page tells HM Passport Office examiners how to check a person who has confirmed a customer’s identity is acceptable for the purposes of British passport applications.</p>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application with a countersignatory or digital referee confirming the customer’s identity, you must decide if they meet <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">the criteria</a> and if you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark63">use discretion</a>.</p>

<h3>Person confirming an ID and customer’s details are the same</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where there is a countersignatory or digital referee, you must check the surname, email address and phone number of a customer and the person confirming their identity. This is to make sure they are not the same person, or it is not a family member.</p>

<p>If the phone number or email address are the same, you must reject the person confirming the customer’s identity and ask the customer for a new person to confirm their identity.</p>

<h3>Checking the signature of a person confirming an identity</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where there is a countersignatory or digital referee, you may have to check their signature.</p>

<h4>Digital referee: checking their signature</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application with a digital referee (who has completed the online or the 1-page countersignatory form process) is a British passport holder and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is the customer’s first nominated digital referee, you must not compare their signature with the one on Main Index (as the Digital Customer Service does not capture customer’s signatures)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has been nominated to replace a previous digital referee, you must check their signature is genuine</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If they are not a British passport holder and have completed the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>online process, you cannot compare their signature, but you must check the copy of their passport matches the details provided on the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1-page countersignatory form, you must compare their signature on the 1-page countersignatory form with the one on the copy of their passport (they are told they must provide this)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If they have not provided a copy of their non-British passport, you must ask for a copy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using the task on the Digital Application Processing (DAP) system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by sending a T201 using the Application Management system (AMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not accept the digital referee, you must ask the customer for a new digital referee.</p>

<h4>Countersignatory: checking their signature</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory has completed the paper SE04 or OS application form and you are using them to prove the customer’s identity. You must check the countersignatory’s signature on the paper application form against the customer’s photo.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about the countersignatory’s signature, you must compare their signature on the application form and photos to the one on their passport.</p>

<p>If a countersignatory holds a British passport and their signature does not exist on MI you must ask for more information to prove their signature is genuine (see authorisation and consent: checking consent is genuine).</p>

<p>If they hold a non-British passport you must check the details against the photocopy they have provided.</p>

<h3>Checking a person’s British passport</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application with a countersignatory or digital referee, they must provide their name and British passport number on the application so the system can check it against our passport records.</p>

<h4>Checking a British passport: online process</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the digital referee has completed the Digital Customer Service online process. Their British passport has already been checked by our systems.</p>

<p>A digital referee cannot continue the online process to confirm a customer’s identity, if the system cannot find their British passport number on our records.</p>

<h4>Checking a British passport: offline process</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee has completed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the 1-page countersignatory form (the Digital Customer Service offline process)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a paper SE04 or OS application form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Their British passport has not been checked until the form they have completed is scanned onto the system.</p>

<p>If the system does not complete the checks on the countersignatory or digital referee’s British passport or their details are missing or incorrect, you must do a manual check using MI or G-search.</p>

<p>You must only accept a countersignatory or digital referee if their British passport is an uncancelled digital, biometric or machine-readable passport (MRP). We cannot accept uncancelled Old Blue passports for our purposes.</p>

<p>If the countersignatory or digital referee’s British passport has been cancelled and they have had a new one issued:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you must ask them for their new passport number <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark75">by sending a T201 letter as we need more information</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the old or new passport is a MRP issue, you must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>check the countersignatory address using reference sources (for example, the General Medical Council, Royal Mail or the Yellow pages)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>contact the countersignatory for confirmation of signing the application form and ask them for their new passport number <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark75">by sending a T201 letter as we need more information</a></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the countersignatory confirms that the current passport is the one that raised the warning you must ask for a new countersignature.</p>

<p>If you have any fraud or safeguarding concerns, you must refer the application to CFT.</p>

<h4>No trace of their British passport</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where you cannot find the countersignatory or digital referee’s British passport on Main Index (MI) or G-search. You must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Carry out standard checks on the customer and countersignatory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check we can <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">accept the person confirming the customer identity</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contact the person confirming the customer’s identity to ask for their passport number (if the results show no signs of fraud).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If a passport number appears to be genuine and there is no sign of fraud or safeguarding concerns, you must follow the adding records to MI guidance to add the passport.</p>

<h3>Checking a person’s non-British passport</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee is a non-British passport holder (they hold an Irish, European Union, United States, or Commonwealth passport). They must send a colour or black and white photocopy of the personal details page of their passport, with the customer’s British passport application or at our request (if we contact them).</p>

<p>You must check the details (for example name and passport number) on the application match the photocopy of the personal details page of their passport.</p>

<p>If their details do not match or they do not include them, you must ask the countersignatory or digital referee, for them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using the task on the Digital Application Processing (DAP) system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>by sending a T201 using the Application Management system (AMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking a person’s profession and address</h3>

<p>Before you (the examiner) accept a countersignatory or digital referee. You must make sure they are in a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">recognised profession for passport purposes</a> and you can trace the address they gave us.</p>

<p>If you have concerns about them, you must check their details and if their company is registered if they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a driving instructor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark44">limited or unlimited company</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before you contact the person, who confirmed the customer’s identity, you must check their details on third party reference sources, such as 192.com, Yell.com and larger company websites to check the address, they gave us (for example their company name and address) exists.</p>

<p>If a home address is provided, you can use Main Index (MI) to see if they used the same address for their passport application.</p>

<h4>Confirming if a limited or unlimited company is genuine</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee is part of a limited or unlimited company and you need to do more identity checks. You must confirm the company is genuine.</p>

<p>If the company is unlimited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact the person</a>, confirming the customer’s identity, to ask for the VAT details of the company</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the VAT details by searching the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company">Companies House register</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add a case note on the application to confirm the company is registered</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the company is limited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the company details by searching the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company">Companies House register</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add a case note on the application to confirm the company is registered or limited</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Confirming if a driving instructor is genuine</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee is a driving instructor and you need to do more identity checks, you must confirm they are genuine by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Contacting the person, confirming the customer’s identity, to ask for their approved driving instructor (ADI) number.</p>

<h4>Confirming a teacher during school holidays</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where countersignatory or digital referee is a teacher and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>do not need to complete any further checks, for example, contact them using a T200, you can accept them as a person who confirms the customer’s identity and continue examining the application as normal. It does not matter if they have provided their work or home address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">must contact them</a> and it is the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/school-term-holiday-dates">school holidays</a>, and the teacher has given their work address. You must contact the customer by phone, to explain you cannot contact teachers during the school holidays, and they can:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>ask a new person to confirm their identity, for the application to continue</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>have their application put on hold (by putting it into pigeonhole) until the school holidays end, and we are able to contact the teacher</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you get the new countersignatory or digital referee you must contact them by email or fax (to speed up the process). If you cannot, you must send them a letter.</p>

<h2>When information about person confirming identity is incomplete</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Officer examiners what to do if the information given by a person confirming a customer’s identity, is incomplete or incorrect.</p>

<p>Sometimes the information given by a countersignatory or digital referee, when confirming a customer’s identity, is incomplete or incorrect.</p>

<p>If there is missing information from a countersignatory or digital referee, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them</a> to ask for it.</p>

<p>If a person confirming a customer’s identity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gives you the missing information, you must complete the relevant checks and decide if you have any fraud or safeguarding concerns. If you do not have any concerns, you must consider the application as a whole and continue to examine it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>does not give you the missing information, you must ask the customer for a new countersignatory or digital referee</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The person does not provide their qualifications</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee tells us their profession but does not give us their professional qualifications (for example, a dentist does not need to list their qualifications). You can accept them.</p>

<p>If you have any concerns about their qualifications, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them</a> to ask for more information about their qualifications.</p>

<p>If the person is not employed and does not hold a qualification in a recognised profession, you must ask the customer for a new countersignatory or digital referee.</p>

<h3>The person’s passport number is missing or incorrect</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee has an acceptable profession and appears genuine but does not include their passport details, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them</a> to ask for their passport number.</p>

<p>If the person’s passport appears to be incorrect (is it in a different surname or person), see <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark67">the person’s passport is in a different name</a>.</p>

<p>If they have a non-British passport, they must send us a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark41">copy of their non-British passport</a> personal details page.</p>

<h4>AMS: missing the person’s passport number</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) are dealing with an application on the Application Management System (AMS), where the countersignatory or digital referee has not provided their passport number. You must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them to ask for it</a>.</p>

<p>When they respond with their British passport number, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Enter it in the ‘countersignatures passport number’ section on the ‘countersig’ tab on the Application Management System.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select ‘save’.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The system will carry out an automatic check on the British passport number.</p>

<h3>There is no person confirming a customer’s identity</h3>

<p>If the customer has applied through the Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel, we will tell them when they must provide a digital referee (a person confirming their identity). If a digital referee is provided, you (the examiner) must examine them even if you feel you can identify the customer from the previous passport.</p>

<p>If a customer has not provided a countersignatory or digital referee, either online, using the 1-page countersignatory form or the paper SE04 or OS application form, or a partially completed form and you (the examiner) don’t need one (for example, you can clearly ID the customer), you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>case note your decision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>explain your reasons</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you decide you do need a countersignatory or digital referee, because you cannot identify the customer or to replace a current digital referee who is unacceptable. You must ask the customer to provide one using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DCS, you must ask the customer to provide one:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>using the task (on DAP)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark52">DCS application received: with documents but no digital referee online</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>by <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark53">sending the 1-page countersignatory form</a></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a paper SE04 or OS application form, you must reject the application and ask the customer for a new countersigned application. If you have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>any fraud or safeguarding concerns</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>an application that must have the countersignature section completed but it has been left blank</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>First time adult applications (UK applications only)</h4>

<p>If you, the examiner, are dealing with a customer’s first time adult application and they have not included a countersignatory or digital referee. For example, they have sent us their documents before having a person confirm their identity online.</p>

<p>You must decide if the customer must attend an Authentication by Interview (ABI). If we:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>refer the customer to ABI, you must not ask for a person to confirm their identity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do not refer the customer to ABI, you must request the customer to provide a person to confirm their identity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Documents received: there is no digital referee online</h4>

<p>If the customer has applied through the Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel, and sends us their documents but their digital referee has not completed their section online, you must follow the DAP to AMS guidance.</p>

<h4>Documents received: there is no 1-page countersignatory form</h4>

<p>If the customer has applied through the Digital Customer Service (DCS) channel and has selected to send us the 1-page countersignatory form. But does not send it to us with their documents, SSL will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Case note the application with ‘no csig form enclosed’.</li>
  <li>Send the application to examination.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you receive an application like this, you (the examiner) must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell the customer we have not received the 1-page countersignatory form</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the customer a 1-page countersignatory form (for adult applications)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the 1-page countersignatory form and AMS letter 920 (for child applications)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Countersignatory incorrectly certifies the customer’s photo</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have a paper SE04 or OS application form with 2 passport photos provided, you must check the countersignatory <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">correctly certifies them</a>.</p>

<p>If a countersignatory does not correctly sign the customer’s photo, and you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for more information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to confirm they countersigned the application</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to ask for a correctly certified photo that matches the one the customer sent with the passport application.</p>

<p>If a countersignatory does not correctly sign the photo, and you do not need to contact them for more information, you must ask the customer to send a correctly certified photo that matches the one the customer sent with their passport application.</p>

<h3>If a customer does not send a certified photo</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have a paper SE04 or OS application form and it does not have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark21">correctly certified photo</a>. You must ask the customer to send a certified photo if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>do not need to go for an interview (UK applications only)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>need to go for an interview (overseas applications only)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems submitting a digital referee online</h2>

<p>This page tells HM Passport Office staff what a customer must do if they cannot provide a digital referee online and about the 1-page countersignature form we use in place of an online digital referee.</p>

<p>When a customer asks a digital referee to countersign their application online, they may have problems using the online process.</p>

<h3>A customer cannot provide a digital referee online</h3>

<p>If a customer’s digital referee meets the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">online criteria</a>, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cannot pass our <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">automated identity checks</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has problems logging into the system to complete the process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The digital referee can still be nominated as the customer’s digital referee, using the offline process. To do this, they must ask the customer for a 1-page countersignatory form. The customer must then send the completed 1-page countersignatory form back to us to complete the application process.</p>

<p>Customers can get a 1-page countersignatory form by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>downloading and printing it themselves by logging into their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>phoning Teleperformance to ask the examiner to send them one (we send different forms depending on if it’s an <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark58">adult application</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark59">child application</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DAP (Digital Application Processing) will automatically transfer an application with a 1-page countersignatory form to AMS (Application Management System).</p>

<h4>1-page countersignatory form: adult applications</h4>

<p>If a customer asks us to send them a 1-page countersignatory form, Teleperformance (TP) will transfer the customer to the Customer Service Management team (CSMT) who must follow the digital referee exception process.</p>

<p>If you, the examiner, receive the application, you must send the customer the 1-page countersignatory form.</p>

<h4>1- page countersignatory form: child applications</h4>

<p>If a customer asks us to send them a 1-page countersignatory form, TP will transfer the customer to CSMT who must follow the digital referee exception process.</p>

<p>If you, the examiner, receive the application, you must send the customer a 1-page countersignatory form and AMS letter 920.</p>

<h4>Applications with a 1-page countersignatory form</h4>

<p>When a customer sends us a 1-page countersignatory form, the system automatically sends the application to an AMS examiner, who will get the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1-page countersignatory form - Sopra Steria Ltd (SSL) will scan it on the system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting documents</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you (the examiner) receive a 1-page countersignatory form, you must deal with them using the digital referee guidance.</p>

<h4>1- page countersignatory form: cannot be scanned</h4>

<p>If we get a 1-page countersignatory form that we cannot scan on the system, SSL will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>add a case note to say ‘unscannable csig form’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the application to examination</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you, the examiner, get the application, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell the customer we received their 1-page countersignatory form but could not scan it on our system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send the customer a new 1-page countersignatory form and ask them to fill it in</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital referee received: there are no documents</h3>

<p>If a customer completes the digital referee section online or sends us their 1-page countersignatory form but not their documents, you must follow the DAP to AMS guidance.</p>

<h2>Using discretion on a countersigned application</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office examiners, when to use discretion when examining an application that has been countersigned.</p>

<p>You (the examiner) may need to use discretion when examining a countersignatory or digital referee, if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>are unqualified or has not listed their qualifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>are an unemployed professional</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have known the customer for less than 2 years (SE04 or 1-page forms only)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When considering using discretion to accept or reject a person (who has confirmed a customer’s identity), you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check the person using reference sources (for example, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gmc-uk.org/registration-and-licensing/the-medical-register/a-guide-to-the-medical-register/find-a-doctors-record" rel="external">the General Medical Council</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/" rel="external">Royal Mail</a> or the Yellow pages) before you contact them for missing information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>record your decision when you apply discretion (for example, by adding a case note) and include the reasons why</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider the application as a whole and check if there are any other fraud indicators</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any fraud or safeguarding concerns, you must refer the application to the Counter Fraud team (CFT).</p>

<h3>The person confirming an identity is unqualified</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee, is an unqualified person. You can accept them if the application has no fraud indicators and the countersignatory or digital referee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>is 70 years old or older</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fulfils the rest of the criteria to confirm the customer’s identity but are not in (or retired) from a recognised profession</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can produce original documents to confirm their identity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a person can countersign an application if they are the customer’s retired next door neighbour who was a cleaner.</p>

<h3>The person confirming an identity is unemployed</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee is an unemployed person. You can accept them if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they fulfil the criteria to countersign an application, but may not be currently employed in the relevant and recognised profession</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they have an acceptable passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they can provide the correct qualifications for their profession</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are no fraud indicators</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, a person can countersign an application if they are a qualified dentist but currently unemployed.</p>

<h3>The person confirming an identity uses their home address</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee provides a home address. You (the examiner) can accept their home address, as long as they are in a <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">recognised profession</a> or retired.</p>

<p>If you have any fraud of safeguarding concerns, you must refer the application to CFT.</p>

<h3>The person’s passport is in a different name</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee’s current passport number shows a passport on Main Index or G-search with a different name to the one on the application form, you must consider if it’s a different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>surname (or minor change of name)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>person</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If it is a different surname (or minor change of name) you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact the person</a>, who confirmed the customer’s identity, to confirm if there has been a change of name. If they respond with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an explanation for the change of name (for example, marriage) you must accept their response, as long as all checks are clear and add a case note confirming their response on the customer’s application</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is a different person, you must check the passport number on the application is the same number you are checking on the system. If the passport number is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>not the same, you must change the incorrect number on the system and do the checks again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the same, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact the person</a>, who confirmed the customer’s identity, to confirm the correct passport number</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the person, confirming the customer’s identity, responds with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a different passport number, you must change the incorrect number on the system and do the checks again</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discretion: the ‘capacity known’ section blank</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee leaves the ‘how do you know them’ section blank (or has not provided a reasonable response), you may use discretion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>if there is no suggestion the person is related to the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have no fraud or safeguarding concerns (for example, child protection)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any fraud of safeguarding concerns, you must refer the application to an Enhanced Application Checking (EAC) examiner.</p>

<p>If you have no fraud or safeguarding concerns but do not accept the ‘capacity know’ section as blank, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">ask for a new a person to confirm their identity.</a></p>

<h3>The person has known the customer less than 2 years</h3>

<p>You (the examiner) may use discretion if you have an application where the countersignatory or digital referee has known the customer for less than 2 years, as long as they have known them for at least for 1 year.</p>

<p>You may also accept a person who has countersigned an application, who has known the customer for less than 2 years, if they fit the criteria to countersign an application sent to us by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a member of HM Armed Forces and their dependents, using the dedicated armed forces route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a prisoner who is overseas with a member of the Local Service or FCDO staff who have personal knowledge of the individual</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any fraud of safeguarding concerns, you must refer the application to an Enhanced Application Checking (EAC) examiner.</p>

<h3>Overseas customer cannot find a person</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) have an application where the customer lives overseas and the countersignatory or digital referee meets the criteria but live in a different country to the customer (for example, a customer lives in Bangladesh but their person, confirming a customer’s identity, lives in the UK), you can accept them.</p>

<p>If you are dealing with application where a customer (living overseas) is unable to find a person, who holds 1 of the accepted passports but can find an alternative, they must tell us why they have been unable to get a suitable person.</p>

<p>You must refer the application to your operational team leader (OTL) or above who may decide to accept the person, who has confirmed the customer’s identity after considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the application as a whole</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why the customer is unable to provide a person, that does not hold 1 of the accepted passports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the documents and information provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other identity checks that we will make on the application (for example, if the customer will attend an interview)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The OTL must case note their decision.</p>

<h4>Countersignatory dated the form before the customer</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have a paper SE04 or OS application form where the countersignatory (person, confirming the customer’s identity) has dated the application form before the customer signed their declaration, you can use discretion and accept them. Unless you have any fraud or safeguarding concerns.</p>

<p>If a countersignatory countersigns and dates a paper SE04 or OS application form more than 6 months before we receive it, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>reject the application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask the customer for a new fully completed and countersigned paper SE04 or OS application form</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>The same handwriting is used throughout the application</h4>

<p>If you (the examiner) have a paper SE04 or OS application form with a countersignatory (person, confirming the customer’s identity) and it appears the same handwriting has been used to complete all sections of the application form, you can use discretion and accept it, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the customers and countersignatory’s signature are clearly different</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have no fraud or safeguarding (for example, child protection) concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If it appears the same handwriting was used to fill in the paper application and the customer’s and countersignatory’s signatures, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">contact them</a>, to ask, if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>completed the countersignature section</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certified the photo</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the countersignatory confirms they did not complete or sign the application, but they know the customer, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ask the customer for a new countersigned application form, 2 photos and a new countersignatory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>send AMS letter 171 ‘Forged countersignature warning letter’ to the customer</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact the person who confirmed a customer’s identity</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office examiners, the timescale we allow for a person confirming a customer’s identity to respond, when you do and do not need to send a T200 or T201 letter and how the person can reply to us.</p>

<p>You, the examiner, may need to contact the person who confirmed the customer’s identity as part of the application. Before you contact them, you must check <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">they are</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark32">acceptable</a> and genuine.</p>

<p>You must contact a countersignatory or digital referee if you need:</p>

</ul>

<p>Any contact made must be by phone or email in the first instance, before post.</p>

<p>You must use the withdrawing passport applications guidance to confirm the timescale given for a customer or the person confirming their identity, to respond.</p>

<p>If you do not receive a response from the countersignatory or digital referee, you must reject them and ask the customer for a new countersignatory or digital referee.</p>

<h3>Check a person countersigned an application (T200 letter)</h3>

<p>If you need to check a countersignatory or digital referee has countersigned an application, you must:</p>

<h3>No response to AMS letter 920</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) are dealing with a digital referee (who has completed the 1 page countersignatory form) have not received a response to the additional questions in AMS letter 920, you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>

<h3>Contact a person confirming an identity, by phone</h3>

<p>You may contact the countersignatory or digital referee, by phone, to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how they know the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how long they have known the customer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their profession</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their professional qualifications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their passport number</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not tell them who the customer is (for security reasons)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>not tell them the customer’s name as this defeats the purpose – we expect the person confirming an identity to be able to confirm the application they have countersigned</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are dealing with an urgent or compassionate application, you must contact the person to confirm information by phone, as long as you are certain they can correctly identify the customer.</p>

<h2>Asking for a new person to confirm a customer’s identity</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office examiners how to ask the customer for a new person to confirm their identity if we rejected their original one or they did not give us one.</p>

<p>You may decide to ask for a new countersignatory or digital referee to confirm a customer’s identity (for example, if the digital referee does not meet the criteria to countersign). What you must send depends on if you are requesting a new:</p>

<p>1. Send the correct system letter to the customer, with a blank paper SE04 or OS application form by post. You must use system letter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>170 (if you reject a countersignatory and need a new one)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>172 (if you reject a countersignatory and need a new one and there are multiple applications from the same address)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>171 (if you need to send a warning letter to confirm the countersignatory is forged)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>274 (if an adult application form is incomplete)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>276 (if a child application form is incomplete for children aged 0 to 15)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Store the application in your team, while you wait for the customer to respond.</p>

<p>When you get the new application, you must:</p>

<p>1. Send it to Sopra Steria Ltd and ask them to scan it on the system.</p>

<h3>How to ask for a new digital referee</h3>

<p>If you (the examiner) are asking the customer for a new digital referee. What you must send depends on if the application is on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Digital Application Processing (DAP) system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application Management System (AMS)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When you get the new digital referee (on the 1-page countersignatory form), you must check their signature is genuine.</p>

<h4>AMS: what to send when you ask for a new digital referee</h4>

<p>If you need to ask the customer for a new digital referee to replace their current digital referee (or the customer did not use one), you must send them, by email:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>AMS letter 918</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AMS letter 920 (if it’s a child application)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a 1-page countersignatory form using the Digital Referee template (see: forms and templates on the examiner toolkit)</p>

<h4>DAP: how to ask for a digital referee</h4>

<p>DAP examiners can ask for a digital referee (if a customer has not provided one), when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you compare the customer’s photo to their child photo in their old passport</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you cannot confirm the customer’s identity from their previous photo</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you, the examiner, must request a digital referee from the customer (if they have not provided one when the application was submitted), you must select the option to ask the customer for a digital referee in the task you are processing.</p>

<h4>DAP: after asking a customer for a digital referee</h4>

<p>If you have asked a customer for a digital referee (for example, if you are unable to confirm their identity) their application will remain in DAP. After the customer provides us with a digital referee and completes our questions, we will assign their application to the next available DAP examiner.</p>

<h4>Notifications DAP sends to the customer</h4>

<p>If a customer has not supplied a digital referee, they will get automatic reminders to submit a digital referee for their application. If they do not provide one their application can be withdrawn.</p>

<h3>AMS: withdrawing a customer’s applications</h3>

<p>If you lose of contact with a customer after asking for a new form or any other reason you must withdraw the application, in line with withdrawing passport application guidance.</p>

<h3>Three people cannot confirm a customer’s identity</h3>

<p>If you have asked the customer for 3 different people to confirm their identity (digital referees or countersignatories) and they cannot confirm the customer (or intended passport holder’s) details, you must refer the application to your operational team leader (OTL).</p>

<p>You, the OTL, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>consider the person confirm the customer’s identity responses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide if there are fraud or safeguarding concerns (for example, child protection) that we must investigate</p>
  </li>
</ul>
