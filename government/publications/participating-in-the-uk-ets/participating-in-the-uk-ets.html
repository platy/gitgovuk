<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>) replaced the UK’s participation in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> on 1 January 2021. The 4 governments of the UK have established the scheme to increase the climate ambition of the UK’s carbon pricing policy, whilst also protecting the competitiveness of UK businesses.</p>

<p>This guidance explains who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to and what is required of businesses that are covered.</p>

<p>The UK was instrumental in developing of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> and the introduction of a UK scheme provides continuity of emissions trading for UK businesses. Many of the features and processes in the new UK scheme will be familiar to operators.</p>

<p>Further details of the design of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and proposals for its future development are available in the UK government and devolved administrations’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-future-of-uk-carbon-pricing">response to the consultation on the future of UK carbon pricing</a>. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> is established through <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.</p>

<p>The UK government and the devolved administrations will collectively constitute the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority to oversee the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Detailed guidance</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority and its regulators will release guidance necessary to advise operators and facilitate their compliance obligations with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The “How to Comply” guidance is planned to be released in early 2021 alongside the Small Emitters and Hospital Opt-Out Scheme and the Ultra-Small Emitter Exemption guidance.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.uk/guidance/complying-with-the-uk-ets-as-an-aircraft-operator">Read the initial guidance for aircraft operators</a>. Future guidance will be released as the scheme develops.</p>

<p>If you have any queries, in the first instance please contact your regulator.</p>

<h3>The ‘cap and trade’ approach to reducing emissions</h3>

<p>Emissions trading schemes work on the ‘cap and trade’ principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by sectors covered by the scheme.  This limits the total amount of carbon that can be emitted and, as it decreases over time, will make a significant contribution to how we meet our Net Zero 2050 target and other legally binding carbon reduction commitments.</p>

<p>Within this cap, participants receive free allowances and/or buy emission allowances at auction or on the secondary market which they can trade with other participants as needed. 
Each year, installations and aircraft operators covered by the scheme must surrender allowances to cover their reportable emissions. The cap is reduced over time, so that total emissions must fall.</p>

<p>Each year, installations and aircraft operators covered by the scheme must surrender allowances to cover their reportable emissions. The cap is reduced over time, so that total emissions must fall.</p>

<h2>Who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will apply to energy intensive industries, the power generation sector and aviation.</p>

<p>It covers activities involving combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20MW (except in installations for the incineration of hazardous or municipal waste).</p>

<p>The aviation routes covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will include UK domestic flights, flights between the UK and Gibraltar, and flights departing the UK to European Economic Area states conducted by all included aircraft operators, regardless of nationality .</p>

<p>If you carry out an activity covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, you will need a greenhouse gas emissions permit.</p>

<p>You may also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small emitter or hospital permit (if you are classed as a small emitter or a hospital)</li>
  <li>an emissions monitoring plan (if you are an aircraft operator)</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> are any of the activities listed in Schedule 1 (for Aviation) and Schedule 2 (for stationary installations) of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland electricity generators shall remain in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> by virtue of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<h2>Permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification</h2>

<h3>Operators of stationary installations</h3>

<p>Permits for operators whose activity falls within the scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will receive their permits in 2 stages.</p>

<p>The first stage, which will be completed by the end of 2020, will see operators receive the main part of their permit via the Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program (<abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>) system.</p>

<p>The second stage, which will be completed in early 2021, will see the regulators attach the monitoring methodology plan to relevant permits and make consequential amendments associated with free allocation.</p>

<p>This approach is being taken to ensure that from 1 January 2021 all operators whose activity falls within the scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will have the necessary permitting documentation.</p>

<p>The regulators for each of the UK nations, controlled waters, territorial sea and the UK sector of the continental shelf are listed in <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" class="govuk-link">article 10 of The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.  Failure to comply with your permit and obligations under this Order may lead to significant civil penalties being applied.</p>

<p>Operators should read and understand their permit, and conditions within relating to monitoring and reporting obligations, as well as those requiring third-party verification of reported emissions. Government will be working in 2021/2022 to develop a new system to replace <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>. Until this new system is operational, operators will continue to use the existing <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> system to complete applications and submit reports as normal.</p>

<h3>Aircraft operators</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, aircraft operators will have obligations under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> upon becoming an aircraft operator. Failure to comply with obligations under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> may result in significant civil penalties.</p>

<p>For information on whether you have obligations, and how to comply, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complying-with-the-uk-ets-as-an-aircraft-operator" class="govuk-link">read the guidance for aircraft operators</a>.</p>

<h2>Registry</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Registry has been developed for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>You must have an Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>), or an Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>) in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry to acquire and surrender allowances in line with your obligations.</p>

<p>Once your permit or emissions monitoring plan has been issued, your regulator will instruct the Registry Administrator to open an <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you. You will then be contacted by the Registry Administrator and asked to provide details of a primary contact (who is authorised to give instructions to the Registry Administrator on your behalf), and also to nominate authorised representatives to operate your <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you. Further information on on-boarding will be provided in early 2021.</p>

<p>The opening of a UK Registry account and validation of individuals must undergo the same scrutiny as when opening a bank account. This will include requesting any further information to satisfy the Registry Administrator that you are a fit and proper person to hold an account or act as an authorized representative in relation to an account. As such, this process can take up to 2 months (and longer in some cases).</p>

</div>

<h2>Free allocation</h2>

<p>Free allocation of allowances to qualifying operators of installations and aircraft operators will continue, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage for UK businesses.</p>

<p>The initial approach to free allocation in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will be similar to the EU’s proposed approach for Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>. This will ensure a continuation of emissions trading smooth transition for businesses in 2021. The benchmarks used to calculate free allocation entitlement will be the same as Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> .</p>

<p>Legislation covering free allocation is in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1557/contents/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) Order 2020</a>, which came into force on 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for operators of installations</h3>

<p>For operators of installations, free allowances will also be made available for new entrants to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> as well as existing operators who increase their activity. Each business’s free allocation will be published  in a table – the  Allocation Table – as soon as practicable after 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Stationary operators will also be required to submit verified <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958997/uk-ets-activity-level-report-template.xlsx" rel="external">Activity Level Reports</a> by 30 June in 2021, and by 31 March each year after that. If data contained in these reports show an increase or decrease in activity of 15% or more, the operator’s free allocation will be recalculated in line with this change.</p>

<p>You must use the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958991/uk-ets-verification-report-template.xlsx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">verification report template</a> to submit your verified activity levels, new entrants and baseline data reports. You must submit the completed template to your regulator with your data report.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for aircraft operators</h3>

<p>Aircraft operators who wish to apply for free allocation must do so by 31 March 2021.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-ets-apply-for-free-allocation">Read guidance on applying for free allocation for aircraft operators</a>.</p>

<h2>Auctioning and market operation</h2>

<p>Auctioning will continue to be the primary means of introducing allowances into the market. Participants will also be able to trade <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> emissions allowances on a secondary market. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/ICE-publishes-auction-calendar-for-UKs-new-Emissions-Trading-Scheme/default.aspx">The calendar for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions in 2021</a> was published by auction platform provider ICE Futures on 26 February 2021.</p>

<p>The calendar confirms the volume of allowances available in each auction, with the potential for minor revisions once volumes for aviation free allocation are finalised (expected in June 2021). The first <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auction will be held on 19 May 2021. ICE’s announcement of the auction calendar also includes information about the establishment of the secondary market.</p>

<p>Auctions can clear, with allowances being sold to bidders, without all allowances being successfully bid for. Any remaining allowances not sold in an auction are redistributed across the following four auctions up to 125% of those auctions’ original number of allowances. Above this limit, allowances will transfer into the market stability mechanism account.</p>

<h3>Auction Reserve Price</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will have a transitional Auction Reserve Price (<abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr>) of £22, which establishes a minimum price for which allowances can be sold at auctions. Bids below this price will not be successful at auction. The <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> value was set in the Auctioning Regulations published on 11 February 2021, and the government does not intend to make any further changes to the level of the Auction Reserve Price before it is likely withdrawn as the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> matures. The government will consult on its intent to withdraw the <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> as part of the planned consultation to appropriately align the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> cap with a net zero trajectory which will be launched later this year.</p>

<h3>Cost Containment Mechanism</h3>

<p>There will also be a Cost Containment Mechanism (<abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr>) which provides a process for the UK government and devolved administrations to address significant extended price spikes in the market.  The UK <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will have lower price and time triggers in the first two years of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> when compared to the equivalent <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> mechanism.</p>

<p>This will allow quicker intervention in the early years if appropriate. If the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered, a meeting of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority is called to consider what intervention, if any, to make. If there is no agreement on what action to take, the final decision will be taken by HM Treasury (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr>). This intervention can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>redistributing allowances between the current year’s auctions</li>
  <li>bringing forward auctioned allowances from future years to the current year</li>
  <li>drawing allowances from the market stability mechanism account</li>
  <li>auctioning up to 25% of the remaining allowances in the New Entrants Reserve</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Auctioning Regulations</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348220049/contents" rel="external">The Auctioning Regulations</a> govern the auctioning of UKAs and the provision of a secondary market. The Auctioning Regulations and Explanatory Memorandum contain additional policy background relating to <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Auctions. BEIS will be appointed by <abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr> as UK Auctioneer for these auctions. This role is required by legislation and is responsible for the conduct of the auctions.</p>

<p>The Auctioning Regulations is laid alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2021/9780348220032/contents" rel="external">Recognised Auction Platforms (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions Regulations 2021) Affirmative Statutory Instrument</a>. This SI establishes a market and auction oversight role for the FCA in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and establishes UK emissions allowances as ‘financial instruments’, ensuring they are subject to the correct regulatory treatment.</p>

<p>ICE Futures Europe will continue to provide the auction platform and secondary market services under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> until December 2022. Auction participants will need to register with ICE as the appointed auction platform. Market participants who are interested in bidding in the auction should contact sales-utilities@theice.com.</p>

<p>Participants will also require a registry account. Further information on opening a registry account will be provided in due course.</p>

<p>For more information about the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:emissions.trading@beis.gov.uk">emissions.trading@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Simplified provisions for small emitters and hospitals, and ultra-small emitting installations</h2>

<p>In the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, there will be simplified provisions for small emitting installations and hospitals with emissions lower than 25,000t CO2e per annum and a net-rated thermal capacity below 35MW. These installations will be subject to emissions targets instead of trading allowances. Separate simplified provisions are available to Installations with emissions lower than 2,500t CO2e per annum.</p>

<p>Further information for installations in these categories will be provided in due course.</p>
