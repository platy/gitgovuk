<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>) replaced the UK’s participation in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> on 1 January 2021. The 4 governments of the UK have established the scheme to increase the climate ambition of the UK’s carbon pricing policy, while protecting the competitiveness of UK businesses.</p>

<p>This guidance explains who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to and what is required of businesses that are covered.</p>

<p>The UK was instrumental in developing the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> and the introduction of a UK scheme provides continuity of emissions trading for UK businesses. Many of the features and processes in the new UK scheme will be familiar to operators.</p>

<p>Further details of the design of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and proposals for its future development are available in the UK government and devolved administrations’ <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-future-of-uk-carbon-pricing">response to the consultation on the future of UK carbon pricing</a>. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> is established through <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.</p>

<p>The UK government and the devolved administrations collectively constitute the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority to oversee the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Detailed guidance</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority and its regulators will release guidance necessary to advise operators and facilitate their compliance obligations with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>The ‘How to Comply’ guidance will be released in early 2021.</p>

<p><a href="https://gov.uk/guidance/complying-with-the-uk-ets-as-an-aircraft-operator" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Read the initial guidance for aircraft operators</a>. Future guidance will be released as the scheme develops.</p>

<p>If you have any queries, in the first instance please contact your regulator.</p>

<h3>The ‘cap and trade’ approach to reducing emissions</h3>

<p>Emissions trading schemes work on the ‘cap and trade’ principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by sectors covered by the scheme. This limits the total amount of carbon that can be emitted and, as it decreases over time, will make a significant contribution to how we meet our Net Zero 2050 target and other legally binding carbon reduction commitments.</p>

<p>Within this cap, participants receive free allowances and/or buy emission allowances at auction or on the secondary market which they can trade with other participants as needed.</p>

<p>Each year, installations and aircraft operators covered by the scheme must surrender allowances to cover their reportable emissions. The cap is reduced over time, so that total emissions must fall.</p>

<h2>Who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will apply to energy intensive industries, the power generation sector and aviation.</p>

<p>It covers activities involving combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20MW (except in installations for the incineration of hazardous or municipal waste).</p>

<p>The aviation routes covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will include UK domestic flights, flights between the UK and Gibraltar, and flights departing the UK to European Economic Area states conducted by all included aircraft operators, regardless of nationality.</p>

<p>If you carry out an activity covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, you will need a greenhouse gas emissions permit.</p>

<p>You may also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small emitter or hospital permit (if you are classed as a small emitter or a hospital)</li>
  <li>an emissions monitoring plan (if you are an aircraft operator)</li>
</ul>

<p>Activities covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> are any of the activities listed in Schedule 1 (for Aviation) and Schedule 2 (for stationary installations) of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland electricity generators shall remain in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> by virtue of the Ireland / Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<h2>Permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification</h2>

<h3>Operators of stationary installations</h3>

<p>Permits for operators whose activity falls within the scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will receive their permits in 2 stages.</p>

<p>The first stage, which will be completed by the end of 2020, will see operators receive the main part of their permit via the Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program (<abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>) system.</p>

<p>The second stage, which will be completed in early 2021, will see the regulators attach the monitoring methodology plan to relevant permits and make consequential amendments associated with free allocation.</p>

<p>This approach is being taken to ensure that from 1 January 2021 all operators whose activity falls within the scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will have the necessary permitting documentation.</p>

<p>The regulators for each of the UK nations, controlled waters, territorial sea and the UK sector of the continental shelf are listed in <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" class="govuk-link">article 10 of The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>. Failure to comply with your permit and obligations under this Order may lead to significant civil penalties being applied.</p>

<p>Operators should read and understand their permit, and conditions within relating to monitoring and reporting obligations, as well as those requiring third-party verification of reported emissions. Government will be working in 2021 to 2022 to develop a new system to replace <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>. Until this new system is operational, operators will continue to use the existing <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> system to complete applications and submit reports as normal.</p>

<h3>Using UK greenhouse gas inventory data in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> monitoring and reporting: the country-specific factor list</h3>

<p>The Monitoring and Reporting Regulation, as modified by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Order, allows nationally reported data to be used by operators as default factors in specific circumstances. See the country-specific factor list:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-uk-greenhouse-gas-inventory-data-in-uk-ets-monitoring-and-reporting-the-country-specific-factor-list" class="govuk-link">Using UK greenhouse gas inventory data in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> monitoring and reporting: the country-specific factor list</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Aircraft operators</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, aircraft operators will have obligations under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> upon becoming an aircraft operator. Failure to comply with obligations under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> may result in significant civil penalties.</p>

<p>For information on whether you have obligations, and how to comply, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complying-with-the-uk-ets-as-an-aircraft-operator" class="govuk-link">read the guidance for aircraft operators</a>.</p>

<h2>Registry</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Registry has been developed for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>. There are different types of account available in the Registry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Trading Accounts</li>
  <li>Person Holding Accounts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>) and Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Operators must have a holding account in the Registry to acquire and surrender allowances in line with <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> obligations.</p>

<p>Aircraft operators will need to have an Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>). All other operators will need to have an Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>). These accounts can also be used to trade allowances.</p>

<p>Once your permit or emissions monitoring plan has been issued, your regulator will instruct the Registry Administrator to open an <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you. You will be contacted by the Registry Administrator and asked to provide details of a primary contact (who is authorised to give instructions to the Registry Administrator on your behalf), and also to nominate authorised representatives to operate your <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you.</p>

<h3>Trading Accounts</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Trading Accounts are available for holding and trading of UK allowances that is not related to <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> compliance.</p>

<p>To open a trading account, you must first register to use the service, and then request to open a trading account. The Registry Administrator will then get in touch with you to guide you through the remainder of the process.</p>

<p>Trading accounts require at least 2 registered authorised representatives to operate the account.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a href="https://view-emissions-trading-registry.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Apply for access to the Registry</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Person Holding Accounts</h3>

<p>The Registry is also used to host the UK Kyoto Protocol Registry, and Person Holding Accounts are available to be requested if you need to hold or trade international units.</p>

<h3>Opening a UK Registry account</h3>

<p>The opening of a UK Registry account and validation of individuals must undergo similar scrutiny as when opening a bank account. This will include requesting any further information to satisfy the Registry Administrator that both you (the account holder) and the nominated authorised representatives are fit and proper.</p>

<p>This process can take longer for account representatives based outside of the UK.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/documents-required-to-register-for-the-uk-emissions-trading-registry">Read further guidance on what documents you will need to open an account</a>.</p>

<h3>Timetable for onboarding Registry accounts</h3>

<p>Users intending to request a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> trading account can now <a class="govuk-link" href="https://view-emissions-trading-registry.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">register and sign in to use the service</a>. Once registered, users can apply to open a <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Trading Account.</p>

<p>A timetable for when all other users can access the service is outlined below.</p>

<h4>From 4 May 2021</h4>

<p>Operators and Aircraft Operators participating in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will be contacted by the Registry Administrator and asked to provide details of a primary contact (who is authorised to give instructions to the Registry Administrator on your behalf), and also to nominate authorised representatives to manage their Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>) or Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>).</p>

<p>UK Kyoto Protocol (KP) Person Holding Account holders in the EU Registry will have their accounts and units migrated to the UK Registry. These users will be contacted by the Registry Administrator and asked to provide details of a primary contact (who is authorised to give instructions to the Registry Administrator on your behalf), and also to nominate at least 2 authorised representatives to operate these migrated accounts for you.</p>

<h4>From late May 2021</h4>

<p>You will be able to apply to open a new UK KP Person Holding Account. The exact date will be confirmed at a later date.</p>

<p>A link to the UK Emissions Trading Registry will be made available here once it is open for registrations in April.</p>

</div>

<h2>Free allocation</h2>

<p>Free allocation of allowances to qualifying operators of installations and aircraft operators will continue, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage for UK businesses.</p>

<p>The initial approach to free allocation in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will be similar to the EU’s proposed approach for Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>. This will ensure a continuation of emissions trading smooth transition for businesses in 2021. The benchmarks used to calculate free allocation entitlement will be the same as Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> .</p>

<p>Legislation covering free allocation is in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1557/contents/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) Order 2020</a>, which came into force on 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for operators of installations</h3>

<p>Free allowances will be made available for operators of eligible installations who applied for a free allocation of allowances for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period and for new entrants to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>. The free allocation application validity will be determined by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> authority.</p>

<p>Each installation’s free allocation will be published in an Allocation Table once it has been calculated and approved by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> authority.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0447&amp;qid=1615797821614" class="govuk-link" rel="external">industry benchmarks used to calculate free allocation</a> were published by the European Commission on the 12 March 2021.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-ets-allocation-table-for-operators-of-installations">Allocation Table</a>, which contains a list of each installation’s free allocation for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period, was published on 11 May 2021. Free allowances for the 2021 scheme year were allocated to operator holding accounts in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry on 26 May 2021.</p>

<h4>Submitting Activity Level Reports</h4>

<p>If you are included in the Allocation Table, you must submit a verified <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958997/uk-ets-activity-level-report-template.xlsx" rel="external">Activity Level Report</a>. For 2021 the deadline for submission was 30 June, so your report should  already have been submitted to your regulator. From 2022 onwards the deadline each year to submit these reports will be 31 March.</p>

<p>If the data in your Activity Level Report shows an increase or decrease in activity of 15% or more from historic activity levels (calculated from the previous 2 years activity levels), your free allocation of allowances will be recalculated.</p>

<p>Your regulator re-calculates the free allocation of allowances in line with the Activity Level Change Regulation. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority approves the final allocation.</p>

<p>When approved, you will be notified by your regulator of changes to the final free allocation of allowances in due course.</p>

<p>Any changes to free allocation of allowances in 2021 will be published in an updated Allocation Table at a later date. (Please note that we will prioritise instances of initial overallocation, with installations having an under allocation and further amendments processed up until January 2022).</p>

<p>Any increase in allocation will be allocated to Operator Holding Accounts in the Registry in line with the updated allocation table, and any reductions in entitlement will mean that you must return any over-allocations from your Operator Holding Account.</p>

<p>You will be able to access your updated Activity Level Report from <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> following your regulator’s review. This <abbr title="Activity Level Report">ALR</abbr> will contain updated benchmarks and any other changes agreed with your regulator and should be used in future years.</p>

<p>You must use the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958991/uk-ets-verification-report-template.xlsx" class="govuk-link">verification report template</a> for the verification of your activity levels data. You must submit the completed verification report template to your regulator with your activity levels data report.</p>

<h4>Free Allocation from 2022</h4>

<p>In 2022 and every scheme year thereafter, free allocation will be allocated on or before 28 February of each calendar year. The deadline for submitting verified Activity Level Data Reports will be the 31 March of each calendar year.</p>

<h4>Cross-Sectoral Correction Factor</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> authority has determined that no cross-sectoral correction factor (CSCF) will be applied for the 2021-2025 allocation period.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for aircraft operators</h3>

<p>Free allocation will be made available to all eligible aircraft operators who applied for a free allocation of allowances under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each aircraft operator’s free allocation entitlement will be published on the Aviation Allocation Table (AAT) once it has been calculated and approved by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> authority.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-ets-aviation-allocation-table" class="govuk-link">Aviation Allocation Table</a> contains a list of each aircraft operator’s free allocation entitlement for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period. This table is subject to change and the years 2023-2025 should be treated as indicative, pending the outcome of the ongoing free allocation review. Free Allowances for the 2021 scheme year will be allocated to operator holding accounts in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry after the publication of the Aviation Allocation Table.</p>

<h2>Auctioning and market operation</h2>

<p>Auctioning will continue to be the primary means of introducing allowances into the market. Participants will also be able to trade allowances on a secondary market.</p>

<p>The auction calendar confirms the volume of allowances available in each auction. A revised <a rel="external" href="https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/circulars/21166.pdf" class="govuk-link">2021 auction calendar</a> was published by <abbr title="Intercontinental Exchange">ICE</abbr> Futures Europe on 19 October 2021. The <a href="https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/circulars/21184.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">2022 auction calendar was published on 3 November 2021</a>. There is the potential for minor revisions to the 2022 auction calendar once volumes for aviation free allocation are finalised.</p>

<p>Auctions can clear, with allowances being sold to bidders, without all allowances being successfully bid for. Any remaining allowances not sold in an auction are redistributed across the following four auctions up to 125% of those auctions’ original number of allowances. Above this limit, allowances will transfer into the market stability mechanism account.</p>

<p>The 2023 Auction Calendar will be published in the second half of 2022.</p>

<h3>Auction Reserve Price</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> will have a transitional Auction Reserve Price (<abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr>) of £22, which establishes a minimum price for which allowances can be sold at auctions. Bids below this price will not be successful at auction. The <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> value was set in the Auctioning Regulations published on 11 February 2021, and the government does not intend to make any further changes to the level of the Auction Reserve Price before it is likely withdrawn as the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> matures. The government will consult on its intent to withdraw the <abbr title="Auction Reserve Price">ARP</abbr> as part of the planned consultation to appropriately align the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> cap with a net zero trajectory which will be launched later this year.</p>

<h3>Cost Containment Mechanism</h3>

<p>There is also a Cost Containment Mechanism (<abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr>), which provides a powerful tool for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority to intervene if prices are elevated for a sustained period. The UK <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> has lower price and time triggers in the first two years of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> when compared to the equivalent <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> mechanism, this is to ensure the intervention can be more agile in early years whilst the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> matures.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered, a meeting of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority is called to consider what intervention, if any, to make and will be based on addressing sustained price movements that do not correspond to market fundamentals. If there is no agreement on what action to take, the final decision will be taken by HM Treasury (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Treasury">HMT</abbr>). This intervention can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>redistributing allowances between the current year’s auctions</li>
  <li>bringing allowances into auctions from the flexible share</li>
  <li>increasing the volume of allowances to be auctioned by:
    <ul>
      <li>bringing forward auctioned allowances from future years</li>
      <li>drawing allowances from the market stability mechanism account</li>
      <li>auctioning up to 25% of the remaining allowances in the New Entrants Reserve</li>
      <li>auctioning allowances which form part of the industry cap on free allocation to stationary installations for the current or past scheme years where the amount of free allocation is lower than the industry cap</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the decision about what intervention, if any, to make will be clearly communicated to participants in a timely manner.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/126239/ccm-ets-1.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>Until January 2022, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the average end of day settlement price of a UK allowance (<abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr>) December futures contract is more than 2 times  the average price for the preceding two-year ‘reference period’, for three consecutive months (the ‘monitoring period’).</p>

<p>From February 2022 until January 2023, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the average end of day settlement price of the relevant <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is more than 2.5 times the average price for the reference period for the duration of the monitoring period.</p>

<p>From February 2023 onwards, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered if the relevant <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> futures contract is 3 times the average price for the reference period for 6 consecutive months.</p>

<p>An explanation of the operation of the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is set out in the explanatory memorandum to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/484/regulation/12"><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctioning regulations</a>.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/126240/ccm-ets-2.jpg" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>The 2-year reference period ends when the 3 consecutive months monitoring period starts. This means that the whole period under consideration is 27 months, split into two components – the 2-year ‘reference period’, and followed by the 3-month ‘monitoring period’. To calculate the carbon price in the 2-year reference period, a combination of EU allowance (<abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr>) December future contracts and <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December future contracts may be used dependent upon when the 2-year reference is counted from. <abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr> prices are used as a reference due to the limited <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> market data available since <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions only started in May 2021.</p>

<p>When the 2-year reference period starts in 2019 or 2020, the carbon price calculation includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end of day settlement prices of the EU allowance (<abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr>) December futures contracts up until 31 December 2020. After this date <abbr title="European Union allowance">EUA</abbr> prices are no longer counted. This price was converted from EUR to GBP using the respective historical daily spot exchange rate, provided by the Bank of England</li>
  <li>from 1 January 2021 onwards, the end of day settlement prices of the <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contracts is counted. However, from 1 January 2021 to 18th May 2021 there were no <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> future contracts. Therefore, these days are treated as non-trading days and do not contribute to the 2-year average</li>

<p>The monthly average carbon price is calculated by dividing the sum of the end of day settlement prices for the relevant December futures contract during each month by the number of days in the month for which a price is published. For trading days from 19 May 2021 until 30 November 2021, the 2021 <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is used. From 1 December 2021 until the 30 November 2022, the 2022 <abbr title="UK allowance">UKA</abbr> December futures contract is used.</p>

<p>In order for the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> to be triggered, there must be 3 consecutive months where monthly average prices are above the trigger price.</p>

<h4>December 2021 trigger</h4>

<p>As demonstrated in the table above, the next possible opportunity for the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> to be triggered is December 2021.</p>

<p>To calculate whether the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered in December, it is first necessary to calculate the average carbon price for the 2-year reference period. This is done by dividing the sum of the end of day settlement prices from 1 September 2019 to 31 August 2021 by the number of days for which an end of day settlement price for relevant December futures contract is published during the reference period. This number is then multiplied by 2. This calculation results in a trigger price of £52.88.</p>

<p>The monthly average carbon prices in September and October 2021 are above the December trigger price of £52.88. This means that if the price remains on average above £52.88 in November 2021, the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered in December 2021. </p>

<h4>January 2022 trigger</h4>

<p>To calculate whether the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> is triggered in January 2022, the relevant reference period is 1 October 2019 to 30 September 2021. The trigger price for January is £56.58. The average price in October 2021 was £60.98 which is above the trigger. If the average monthly prices in November and December 2021 remain above £56.58 the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered in January 2022.</p>

<p>Triggering the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> in this month runs separately from triggering in previous months, and depends on the calculation of future average monthly prices.</p>

<h4>February 2022 trigger</h4>

<p>February 2022 is the first month where the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> trigger price will be 2.5 times the average price in the reference period. The reference period for February 2022 is 1 November 2019 to 31 October 2021. The trigger price for February 2022 is £75.76. If prices are above this level in November, December and January the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> will be triggered in February.</p>

<p>Triggering the <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> in this month runs separately from triggering in previous months, and depends on the calculation of future average monthly prices.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority will update this page monthly with the latest <abbr title="Cost Containment Mechanism">CCM</abbr> trigger prices and monthly average carbon prices. The next update will be on the 1 December 2021.</p>

<h2>Simplified provisions for small emitters and hospitals, and ultra-small emitting installations</h2>

<p>In the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, there will be simplified provisions for small emitting installations and hospitals with emissions lower than 25,000t CO2e per annum and a net-rated thermal capacity below 35MW. These installations will be subject to emissions targets instead of trading allowances. Separate simplified provisions are available to Installations with emissions lower than 2,500t CO2e per annum.</p>
