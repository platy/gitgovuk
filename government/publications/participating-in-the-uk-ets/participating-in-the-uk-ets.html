<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A UK Emissions Trading Scheme (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>) replaced the UK’s participation in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> on 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>The UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments and Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs – collectively making up the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority – have established the scheme to increase the climate ambition of the UK’s carbon pricing policy, while protecting the competitiveness of UK businesses. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> is established through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.</p>

<p>This guidance explains who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to and what is required of installation operators and aircraft operators that are covered by it.</p>

<p>The UK was instrumental in developing the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> and the introduction of a UK scheme provides continuity of emissions trading for UK businesses. Many of the features and processes in the new UK scheme will be familiar to installation operators and aircraft operators.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Regulators are responsible for enforcing compliance with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Regulations, including operational functions such as issuing and ensuring compliance with permits (for installations) and emissions plans (for aviation).</p>

<p>The regulators for each of the UK nations, controlled waters, territorial sea and the UK sector of the continental shelf are listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external">article 10 of The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>. Who your regulator is depends on where your installation is located (installation operators) or where your business is registered (aviation).</p>

<p>This table provides the contact address for each regulator.</p>

<h3>Detailed guidance for operators on how to comply</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority and its regulators provide guidance for operators on their compliance obligations with the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Aircraft operators</strong> should read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complying-with-the-uk-ets-as-an-aircraft-operator">overview of the scheme for aviation</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-for-aviation-how-to-comply">detailed guidance for aviation on how to comply</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will publish the detailed guidance for <strong>installation operators</strong> in spring 2022.</p>

<p>If you have queries, contact your regulator in the first instance.</p>

<h3>The ‘cap and trade’ approach to reducing emissions</h3>

<p>Emissions trading schemes usually work on the ‘cap and trade’ principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by sectors covered by the scheme. This limits the total amount of carbon that can be emitted and, as it decreases over time, will make a significant contribution to how we meet our Net Zero 2050 target and other legally binding carbon reduction commitments.</p>

<p>Within this cap, participants receive free allowances and/or buy emission allowances at auction or on the secondary market which they can trade with other participants as needed.</p>

<p>Each year, installation operators and aircraft operators covered by the scheme must surrender allowances to cover their reportable emissions. The cap is reduced over time, so that total emissions must fall.</p>

<h2>Who the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to energy intensive industries, the power generation sector and aviation. Activities in scope of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> are listed in Schedule 1 (aviation) and Schedule 2 (installations) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1265/contents/made" rel="external">Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020</a>.</p>

<h3>Installations</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> applies to regulated activities which result in greenhouse gas emissions, including combustion of fuels on a site where combustion units with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20MW are operated (except in installations where the primary purpose is the incineration of hazardous or municipal waste).</p>

<p><strong>Northern Ireland electricity generators</strong> remain in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr> under the Ireland / Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>

<h3>Aviation</h3>

<p>The routes covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> include UK domestic flights, flights between the UK and Gibraltar, and flights departing the UK to European Economic Area states conducted by all included aircraft operators, regardless of nationality.</p>

<p>Most aircraft operators have obligations under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>For information on how to determine whether you are covered by the scheme read the detailed guidance:  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-for-aviation-how-to-comply">UK Emissions Trading Scheme for aviation: how to comply</a>.</p>

<h2>Simplified provisions for hospitals, small emitters and ultra-small emitters</h2>

<h3>Hospitals and small emitters</h3>

<p>There are simplified provisions for hospitals and also installations with emissions lower than 25,000t CO2e per annum, and where the installation carrying out the activity of combustion has rated thermal capacity below 35MW. These installations will be subject to emissions targets instead of having allowance surrender obligations.</p>

<p>Read the detailed guidance: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opt-out-of-the-uk-ets-if-your-installation-is-a-hospital-or-small-emitter">Opt out of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> if your installation is a hospital or small emitter</a>.</p>

<h3>Ultra-small emitters</h3>

<p>If eligible, installations with emissions lower than 2,500t CO2e per annum may obtain ultra-small emitter status. They would not be required to hold a permit but are still required to monitor and must notify their regulator if they go over the threshold.</p>

<p>Read the detailed guidance: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opt-out-of-the-uk-ets-if-your-installation-is-an-ultra-small-emitter">Opt out of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> if your installation is an ultra-small emitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification</h2>

<p>If you carry out an activity covered by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>, you must hold a greenhouse gas emissions permit or hospital or small emitter permit (installations) or emissions monitoring plan (aircraft operators). Permits and emissions monitoring plans are issued by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Regulators.</p>

<h3>Aviation</h3>

<p>Aircraft operators should refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-for-aviation-how-to-comply">UK Emissions Trading Scheme for Aviation: How to Comply</a> for further guidance as to their obligations under the Scheme and how to meet these. Failure to comply with obligations under The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 may lead to significant civil penalties being applied.</p>

<h3>Installations</h3>

<p>Operators apply for and receive their permits and submit their reports via the Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program (<abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>) previously used under the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Operators should read and understand their permit, and the conditions within relating to monitoring and reporting obligations, as well as those requiring third-party verification of reportable emissions and activity levels.</p>

<p>Failure to comply with your permit and obligations under The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 may lead to significant civil penalties being applied.</p>

<h3>Using UK greenhouse gas inventory data in <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> monitoring and reporting</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2018/2066/contents" rel="external">The Monitoring and Reporting Regulation</a> as modified by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Order, allows nationally reported data to be used by installation operators as default factors in specific circumstances.</p>

<p>The latest data, together with data for previous years (including historical data from UK participation in the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>) and guidance on how to use it, is here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/using-uk-greenhouse-gas-inventory-data-in-uk-ets-monitoring-and-reporting-the-country-specific-factor-list">Carbon emission factors and calorific values from the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory, 2021</a>.</p>

<h3>The <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> system</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> system will continue to be used by aviation operators and installation operators until its replacement by a new permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification (<abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr>) system. This is planned for 2022 for operators and verifiers of installations, and 2023 for operators and verifiers of aircraft. For further information about the new system, see below.</p>

<p>For further information about the <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> system, visit the Environment Agency’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://euets.environment-agency.gov.uk/Authentication/Logon.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fDefault.aspx" rel="external"><abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> portal</a>.</p>

<h3>Finding an accredited <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> verifier</h3>

<p>The Verification Regulation 2018 (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 of 18 December 2018 as modified requires verifiers to be a legal person or another legal entity that is carrying out verification activities for the purpose of <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and is accredited by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukas.com/find-an-organisation/browse-by-category/?cat=2539" rel="external">UK Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> accredited verifiers to have a physical office in the UK or to be a legal entity registered in the UK.</p>

<p><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> is responsible for the accreditation and supervision of verifiers in the UK and for maintaining a list of those verifiers.</p>

<p>Operators are responsible for ensuring that their verifier is accredited for the relevant scope of work. Details of a verifier’s scope of accreditation can be found on the verifier’s certificate of accreditation.</p>

<p>If you are a verification body accredited to perform verification in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> for the first time, you will need an <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> account to view your client’s reports and to submit your verification opinion statement. To do this, email the Environment Agency, quoting <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> Support in your subject line, at:</p>

<h2>New permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification system from autumn 2022</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority is developing a new digital permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification (<abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr>) system to replace <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> will offer a simpler and more intuitive user experience than <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr>. This project is being implemented in collaboration with UK regulators, with inputs from different users of the system including operators and verifiers.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> will launch in a phased approach starting from autumn 2022, but please note that dates will not be confirmed until the system receives formal government approval.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> for operators and verifiers of installations</h3>

<p><abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> will continue to be used for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> compliance activities until autumn 2022. After that, it will be deactivated. UK operators and verifiers of installations will then start using <abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> compliance activities, including submission of annual reports relating to 2022.</p>

<p>During autumn 2022, there may be a period when <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> is not available for certain compliance activities. Regulators will keep users informed of what they need to do and when.</p>

<p>Installation operators and verifiers will not have access to <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> after it has been de-activated. They will be responsible for archiving their own data.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> for operators and verifiers of aircraft</h3>

<p><abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> will be used for the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction for International Aviation (<abbr title="The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation">CORSIA</abbr>) compliance activities up to autumn 2023.</p>

<p>During summer 2023 <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> will be deactivated for aircraft operators and verifiers. They will then start using <abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr> for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> and <abbr title="The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation">CORSIA</abbr> compliance activities, including submission of annual reports relating to 2023.</p>

<p>During summer 2023, there may be a period when <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> is not available for certain compliance activities. Regulators will keep users informed of what they need to do and when.</p>

<p>Aircraft operators and verifiers will not have access to <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> after it has been de-activated. They will be responsible for archiving their own data.</p>

<h3>Keep updated about the new system</h3>

<p>We will provide more detailed timings and deadlines for installation operators and verifiers in early 2022, and support to help transition them onto <abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PMRV@beis.gov.uk"><abbr title="permitting, monitoring, reporting and verification">PMRV</abbr>@beis.gov.uk</a> to register your interest in a user testing group or for any queries you have about the new system.</p>

<h2>The UK Emissions Trading Registry</h2>

<p>The UK Emissions Trading Registry operates in a similar way to an online bank account. The Registry is a secure web-based application that serves as both the UK Emissions Trading Scheme Registry (<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry) holding allowances, and the UK Kyoto Protocol Registry holding international units.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry records include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allowances held in Operator Holding Accounts (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>), Aircraft Operator Holding Accounts (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>), Trading Accounts and Government Accounts</li>
  <li>the movement of allowances between accounts and details of verified emissions and allowances surrendered by operators</li>
  <li>matters relating to the free allocation of allowances to Operator Holding Accounts and Aircraft Operator Holding Accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>UK Kyoto Protocol Registry records include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>holdings of international units in accounts</li>
  <li>international unit transfers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>) and Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Installation operators must have an Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>) in the Registry to acquire and surrender allowances in line with their <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> obligations. Aircraft operators must have an Aircraft Operator Holding Account (<abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr>).</p>

<p>OHAs and AOHAs can also be used to trade allowances (UKAs) in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets.</p>

<p>Once your permit or emissions monitoring plan has been issued by your regulator, they will instruct the Registry Administrator to open an <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you. You will be contacted by the Registry Administrator and asked to provide details of a primary contact (who is authorised to give instructions to the Registry Administrator on your behalf), and also to nominate authorised representatives to operate your <abbr title="Operator Holding Account">OHA</abbr>, or <abbr title="Aircraft Operator Holding Account">AOHA</abbr> for you.</p>

<h3>Trading accounts</h3>

<p><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> trading accounts are available for the holding and trading of UK allowances as an activity unrelated to <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> compliance. Trading accounts cannot be used for <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> compliance, but operators are able to use their OHAs and AOHAs to trade.</p>

<p>To open a trading account, you must first register to use the service, and then request a trading account. The Registry Administrator will then get in touch with you to guide you through the remainder of the process.</p>

<p>Trading accounts require at least 2 registered authorised representatives to operate the account.</p>

<h3>Person Holding Accounts</h3>

<p>The Registry is also used to host the UK Kyoto Protocol Registry, and Person Holding Accounts are available to be requested if you need to hold or trade international units.</p>

<h3>Opening a UK Registry account</h3>

<p>The opening of a UK Registry account and the validation of individuals involves the same level of scrutiny as when opening a bank account. This will include requesting any further information to satisfy the Registry Administrator that you are a fit and proper person to hold an account or to act as an authorised representative in relation to an account. As such, this process can take up to 2 months (and longer in some cases).</p>

<p>Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/documents-required-to-register-for-the-uk-emissions-trading-registry">guidance on the documents needed to open a Registry account</a>.</p>

<h2>Free allocation of allowances</h2>

<p>The free allocation of allowances to eligible installation operators and aircraft operators will continue, to reduce the risk of carbon leakage for UK businesses.</p>

<p>The initial approach to free allocation in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> is similar to the EU’s approach for Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>. This ensures continuity for businesses in this area of the scheme. The benchmarks used to calculate free allocation entitlement are the same as Phase IV of the <abbr title="EU Emissions Trading Scheme">EU ETS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Legislation covering free allocation is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1557/contents/made" rel="external">The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) Order 2020</a>, which came into force on 31 December 2020.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for installation operators</h3>

<p>Free allocations will be made available for operators of eligible installations who applied for a free allocation of allowances for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period and for new entrants to the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr>. The free allocation application validity will be determined by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority.</p>

<p>Each installation’s free allocation is published in an Allocation Table once it has been calculated by the regulators and approved by the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> authority.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-ets-allocation-table-for-operators-of-installations"><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Allocation Table for operators of installations</a> contains a list of each installation’s free allocation for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period. It is updated periodically.</p>

<p>Free allowances for the 2021 scheme year were allocated to operator holding accounts in the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Registry on 26 May 2021.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0447&amp;qid=1615797821614" rel="external">industry benchmarks used to calculate free allocations</a> were published by the European Commission on 12 March 2021.</p>

<h3>Activity Level Reports and changes in allocation</h3>

<p>If you are included in the Allocation Table, you must submit a verified <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958997/uk-ets-activity-level-report-template.xlsx" rel="external">Activity Level Report (<abbr title="Activity Level Report">ALR</abbr>)</a> to your <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> regulator. From 2022 onwards the deadline to submit these reports is 31 March of each calendar year.</p>

<p>If the data in your Activity Level Report shows an increase or decrease in activity of more than 15% from historic activity levels (calculated from the previous 2 years’ activity levels), your free allocation of allowances will be recalculated.</p>

<p>Your regulator recalculates the free allocation of allowances in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1557/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Activity Level Change Regulation</a>. The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority approves the final allocation.</p>

<p>When approved, you will be notified by your regulator of changes to your final free allocation of allowances.</p>

<p>Any changes to the free allocation of allowances based on Activity Level Reports will then be published in the updated Allocation Table.</p>

<p>Some instances of free allocation amendments may be processed at a later point. They will not be reflected in the published Allocation Table until approved by the Authority. You will be contacted if this is the case. Some allowances may be withheld in which case your regulator will notify you.</p>

<p>Any increase in allocation will be allocated to Operator Holding Accounts in the Registry in line with the updated allocation table, and any reductions in entitlement will mean that you must return any over-allocations from your Operator Holding Account. Your regulator will confirm if you are required to return any allowances.</p>

<p>You will be able to access your updated Activity Level Report from <abbr title="Emissions Trading System Workflow Automation Program">ETSWAP</abbr> following your regulator’s review. This <abbr title="Activity Level Report">ALR</abbr> will contain updated benchmarks and any other changes agreed with your regulator and should be used in future years.</p>

<p>You must use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958991/uk-ets-verification-report-template.xlsx" rel="external">verification report template</a> for the verification of your activity levels data. You must submit the completed verification report template to your regulator with your Activity Level Report.</p>

<h3>Free allocation from 2022</h3>

<p>In 2022 and every scheme year thereafter, free allocation will be allocated on or before <strong>28 February</strong> of each calendar year. The deadline for submitting verified Activity Level Reports is <strong>31 March</strong> of each calendar year.</p>

<h3>Cross-sectoral correction factor</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Authority has determined that no cross-sectoral correction factor (CSCF) will be applied for the 2021-2025 allocation period.</p>

<h3>Free allocation for aircraft operators</h3>

<p>Free allocation has been made available to all eligible aircraft operators who applied for a free allocation of allowances under the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> during 2021.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-ets-aviation-allocation-table"><abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> Aviation Allocation Table</a> contains a list of each aircraft operator’s free allocation entitlement for the 2021 to 2025 allocation period. This table is subject to change and the years 2023-2025 should be treated as indicative, pending the outcome of the ongoing free allocation review. Allowances for the relevant scheme year will be allocated to eligible aircraft operators on or before 28 February.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> auctions and market operation</h2>

<p>Auctioning will continue to be the primary means of introducing allowances into the market. Participants will also be able to trade allowances on a secondary market.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-emissions-trading-scheme-markets">UK Emissions Trading Scheme markets</a> for background information on the functioning of the <abbr title="UK Emissions Trading Scheme">UK ETS</abbr> markets.</p>
