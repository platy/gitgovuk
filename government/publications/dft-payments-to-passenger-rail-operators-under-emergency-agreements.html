            <div class="govspeak">
<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) put in place emergency measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>) with privately owned franchised train operating companies (<abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>) to mitigate the financial impacts resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and ensure that rail services could continue to operate.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> were agreed in March 2020 and took effect from 1 April 2020 with their financial provisions back-dated to 1 March 2020. For the majority of <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>, the <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> applied until 20 September 2020 and operated as a temporary amendment to the underlying franchise agreement, which remains in place.</p>

<p>From 21 September 2020 onwards, the <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> were replaced by emergency recovery measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr>) for the majority of <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>. The <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr> are a further temporary amendment to the underlying franchise agreements to allow for a phased transition of <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> onto the new National Rail Contracts (<abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr>).</p>

<p>There are some exceptions to these arrangements for certain <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>. These are described in more depth in the details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/payments-to-passenger-rail-operators-under-emergency-measures-agreements-emas-march-to-september-2020/details-of-operational-support-payments-to-franchised-passenger-rail-operators-under-emergency-agreements">operational support payments to franchised passenger rail operators under emergency agreements and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr></a>, which explains how these payments are calculated and made, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/payments-to-passenger-rail-operators-under-emergency-measures-agreements-emas-march-to-september-2020/details-of-process-for-determining-performance-scores-under-emas">process for determining performance scores under <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr></a>, which outlines how <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> determines <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> performance scores.</p>

<h2>Operational support payments</h2>

<p>Under <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>, <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> receives revenue collected and pays most operating costs incurred by <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> through a regular franchise payment, made roughly every 4 weeks. This payment is entirely to fund the ongoing provision of passenger rail services by these operators. None of this money is passed to shareholders.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027317/operational-payments-to-tocs-under-emergency-agreements-and-nrcs.ods" rel="external">Operational payments to <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> under emergency agreements and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr></a> provides data on these operational support payments for each TOC from 1 March 2020 to 16 October 2021.</p>

<h2>Management and performance fees</h2>

<p>Separately, <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> can also earn management and performance fees. These are payable retrospectively on receipt of audited statutory accounts covering the period to which the fees relate. In due course, and subject to conditions, they represent earnings that can be passed on to shareholders.</p>

<p>The process of assessing and scoring <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>’ performance, and determining the management and performance fees payable as a result, has been concluded for 2 <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> assessment periods from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021 and for 1 <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> assessment period from 20 September 2020 to 31 March 2021.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027320/ema-and-erma-performance-scores-and-fees.ods" rel="external"><abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> performance scores and fees</a> provides data on <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> performance scores, and the management and performance fees payable to those <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> in private ownership.</p>
