<p>Ofsted’s new Common Inspection Framework includes a judgment on personal development, behaviour and welfare. As part of reaching this judgment, throughout their entire inspection, inspectors will look at the extent to which schools are successfully supporting pupils to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gain knowledge of how to keep themselves healthy</li>
  <li>make informed choices about healthy eating, and fitness</li>
</ul>

<p>The following questions and examples of evidence can help school leaders and governing bodies adopt a whole school approach to food.</p>

<h2>Leadership</h2>

<p>Questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What steps have you taken to ensure there is a whole school approach to healthy eating?</li>
  <li>Who is responsible on the senior management team and governing body for healthy food provision and food education?</li>
  <li>How do you monitor and evaluate school food provision and food education?</li>
  <li>How do you involve the wider school community, including parents and governors, in promoting healthy eating?</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of good leadership can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a current ‘whole-school’ food policy shared widely with stakeholders</li>
  <li>strategy references to healthy eating in the school development plan and self-evaluation form</li>
  <li>using premium spending to promote healthy eating and learning, including breakfast and after school clubs</li>
  <li>school meal take-up data</li>
  <li>senior leadership and governor engagement with what children are eating and drinking</li>
  <li>awards and quality assured schemes such as Food for Life, Schools Award, Children’s Food Trust, Healthy Schools</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Food provision</h2>

<p>Questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do you know food is tasty and meets the food standards across the whole day?</li>
  <li>What do children think about the food and drink provided? How are they involved in decision-making?</li>
  <li>How do you ensure your meal provision best meets the needs of your school community?</li>
  <li>What advice is provided for those who choose not to take a school lunch, for example, a healthy packed lunch policy?</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of a good provision can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an attractive, happy and calm dining environment</li>
  <li>staff and children eating together</li>
  <li>catering staff, including midday supervisors who are happy and engaged with school staff and children</li>
  <li>children and parents being actively consulted</li>
  <li>a cashless payment system to reduce queues and stigmatisation of free school meal pupils</li>
  <li>independent verification that school food standards and relevant Government Buying Standards are met across the school day</li>
  <li>making water the drink of choice, freely and easily available</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Food education</h2>

<p>Questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do you measure progress of children’s knowledge and skills about healthy eating?</li>
  <li>How do you make learning about healthy eating, including nutrition advice and practical cooking, possible for all students and across subjects?</li>
  <li>Do you use a qualified subject specialist to teach food education?</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of good food education can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consistent messaging across subjects</li>
  <li>ensuring there is enough timetabling, space and practical resources (equipment, ingredients)</li>
  <li>food education schemes of work with a focus on savoury cooking</li>
  <li>using pupil premium or budgets to provide ingredients for pupils unable to bring from home</li>
  <li>food growing and gardening activities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wider well-being</h2>

<p>Questions to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How does the school link healthy eating within the wider personal development, behaviour and welfare judgment?</li>
  <li>What continuing professional development (<abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr>) and training is in place for all teachers and support staff to support their knowledge of health and wellbeing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence of good wider well-being include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drawing on expertise from outside agencies</li>
  <li>events, assemblies, displays and messaging themed around health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>a culture of exercise and healthy eating</li>
  <li>staff development plans and <abbr title="continuing professional development">CPD</abbr> records</li>
