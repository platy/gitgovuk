<h2>Tackling antimicrobial resistance 2019 to 2024: commitment change process</h2>

<p>This addendum sets out changes to the commitments in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-action-plan-for-antimicrobial-resistance-2019-to-2024">Tackling antimicrobial resistance 2019 to 2024: the UK’s 5-year national action plan</a>. The national action plan is in its third year of delivery and these changes were required to make the commitments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>more specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound (SMART)</li>
  <li>reflect lessons learned from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</li>
  <li>reflect progress that has already been made against ambitions to reduce antibiotic prescribing in food-producing animals</li>
  <li>work towards new sector targets</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) worked with other government departments and agencies, as well as the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to consider, review and update the commitments published in the national action plan. Changes to the human health commitments were approved by a sub-group of the expert committee for Antimicrobial Prescribing, Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (APRHAI). Animal, plant, and environment commitments were reviewed, and changes approved, by the Cross-<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> Steering Group. The changed commitments maintain the overall ambition of the UK antimicrobial resistance (<abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>) programme and will support progress towards the UK’s vision to contain and control <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> by 2040.</p>

<p>Changes to the commitments were approved by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in March 2022.</p>

<h2>Delivery of the UK’s 5-year national action plan</h2>

<p>In January 2019, the UK government published its vision for <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> to be contained and controlled by 2040. The vision recognises that a global problem as significant and complex as <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> requires a long-term course of action that progressively strengthens our understanding of <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> and what works to contain and control it.</p>

<p>In support of the vision, the government also committed to develop a series of 5-year national action plans that will each prioritise actions and direct resources based on the latest information about what the biggest risks are, and which interventions are most effective in addressing them. The government’s current 5-year national action plan in support of the 20-year vision was also published in January 2019 and will run until 2024.</p>

<p>The current national action plan focuses on 3 key ways of tackling <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing the need for, and unintentional exposure to, antimicrobials</li>
  <li>optimising the use of antimicrobials</li>
  <li>investing in innovation, supply and access</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan also sets out 4 measures of success to ensure progress towards our 20-year vision. These include, among others, targets to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>halve healthcare associated Gram-negative bloodstream infections (<abbr title="Gram-negative bloodstream infections">GNBSIs</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>reduce the number of specific drug-resistant infections in people by 10% by 2025</li>
  <li>reduce UK antimicrobial use in humans by 15% by 2024</li>
  <li>reduce UK antibiotic use in food-producing animals by 25% between 2016 and 2020 and define new objectives by 2021 for 2025</li>
  <li>be able to report on the percentage of prescriptions supported by a diagnostic test or decision support tool by 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of changes</h2>

<p>In total 93 commitments have been reworded, 17 new commitments have been added, and 8 commitments have been removed. As well as reflecting lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve the surveillance of <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> and antimicrobial use</li>
  <li>improve the availability of data to better understand the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance across human-health and animals, and linking of this data to enable analysis of <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> and our approach to managing infection through dashboards and research</li>
  <li>reflect priorities identified by the UK <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> Research Programme to explore and evaluate antimicrobial use, prescribing, new therapeutics, diagnostics, stewardship and resistance across both human health and animals</li>
  <li>reflect the particular role the UK is playing internationally in non-traditional and informal political groupings including supporting the UK Special Envoy on <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> and taking a lead role in <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> interest groups</li>
  <li>introduce 4 new commitments to reduce urinary tract infections (<abbr title="urinary tract infections">UTIs</abbr>), in support of the national action plan ambition to halve healthcare associated Gram-negative bloodstream infections (<abbr title="Gram-negative bloodstream infections">GNBSIs</abbr>) by 2024. These commitments reflect the fact that <abbr title="urinary tract infections">UTIs</abbr> are a common pathway to <abbr title="Gram-negative bloodstream infection">GNBSI</abbr>, and that successful management of <abbr title="urinary tract infections">UTIs</abbr> requires a coordinated focus on prevention, diagnostics and treatment, underpinned by clear evidence and data</li>
</ul>

<p>Detail of the changes to the commitments can be found below, according to chapters in the UK <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr> national action plan.</p>

<h2>Glossary of terms</h2>

<p>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS): the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.</p>

<p>Agriculture: the cultivation of land and breeding of animals and plants to provide food, fibre, medicinal plants and other products.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial: a drug that selectively destroys or inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Sometimes referred to as an ‘antimicrobial agent’. Examples include antibiotics (also known as antibacterials) antivirals and antifungal agents. In this document, antimicrobials includes anti-infectives where that would be relevant in the context of the text.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistant bacteria: bacteria with the ability to resist the effects of an antibiotic to which they were once sensitive.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistant genes: occurs due to changes, or mutations, in the DNA of the bacteria, or the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes from other bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer.</p>

<p>Anti-infective: is a general term used to describe any medicine that can inhibit the spread of an infectious organism; in this document, it includes cleaning products such as antibacterial sprays.</p>

<p>Animals: unless specified otherwise, the term animal is used in this publication to refer to food-producing animals and aquaculture as well as companion animals and horses.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance (<abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>): occurs when the microorganisms that cause disease (including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) cease to be affected by the drugs we use to kill them and treat the disease.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS): a key component of a multifaceted approach to improve the safety and quality of patient care whilst preventing the emergence of <abbr title="antimicrobial resistance">AMR</abbr>. Good antimicrobial stewardship involves selecting an appropriate drug and optimising its dose and duration to cure an infection while minimising toxicity and conditions for selection of resistant microbes. Good AMS includes a review of the continuing need for antibiotics following clinical diagnosis and documented actions to stop, continue or change antimicrobial treatment.</p>

<p>Autologous vaccines: a therapeutic agent produced by isolating cells from an individual and processing these cells into a vaccine formulation for treatment of that individual.</p>

<p>Bacteriophage: a group of viruses that infect specific bacteria, usually causing their disintegration or dissolution.</p>

<p>Bacteraemia: the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.</p>

<p>Broad-spectrum antibiotics: these are drugs effective against a wide range of bacteria. For example, meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibacterial. Their use needs to be limited to resistant infections because they tend to increase the risk of resistance in other bacteria.</p>

<p>Carbapenems: broad-spectrum antibiotics, often used as the last line of treatment for hard to treat human infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

<p>Carbapenemese producing Gram-negative organisms: a group of bacteria that is resistant to carbapenems class of antibiotics.</p>

<p>Cephalosporins: a class of beta-lactam antibiotic exhibiting broad-spectrum activity to bacteria.</p>

<p>Third-generation cephalosporins: cephalosporins with activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

<p>Commensal: living on or within another organism and deriving benefit without harming or benefiting the host individual.</p>

<p>Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN): an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> initiative intended to deliver clinical quality improvements and drive transformational change in the acute sector or hospitals. Achieving improvement against a defined set of criteria enables an <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr> trust to qualify for a payment.</p>

<p>Critically important antimicrobials (CIAs): antibiotics identified by the World Health Organization as critically important for human health and their use needs to be restricted, especially in the veterinary sector. In the UK, we use the European Medical Agency definition of the CIAs. There are 3 classes of highest priority CIAs to which the animal industry applies restrictions.</p>

<p>Disease burden: includes the number of infections in the population and includes economic costs like treatment costs and the cost to health in terms of mortality and morbidity.</p>

<p>Escherichia coli (E. coli): a type of bacteria common in human and animal intestines, and forms part of the normal gut flora (the bacteria that exist in the bowel).</p>

<p>Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL): enzymes that can be synthesised and expressed by bacteria, resulting in resistance to many penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics and often to other types of antibiotic. In humans, the most frequently identified bacteria that produce ESBLs are Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella species. The ESBLs that E. coli most often produce are called CTX-M enzymes. E. coli with ESBLs may cause urinary tract infections (<abbr title="urinary tract infections">UTIs</abbr>) that can sometimes progress to more serious infections like blood poisoning.</p>

<p>Falsified medications: medications that deliberately or fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source and are likely to be ineffective.</p>
