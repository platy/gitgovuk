<p>This guidance is for local councils  or other cemetery operators. It covers developments from 1 April 2022 which require new planning permission under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The guidance applies to proposals to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>develop a new cemetery</li>
  <li>expand an existing cemetery</li>
</ul>

<p>Expanding an existing cemetery means extending the geographical area of a site to an extent that you need new planning permission under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p>

<h2>Environmental risks from burials</h2>
<p>Like all developers and operators, those involved with cemeteries have a legal responsibility not to cause pollution.</p>

<p>There is the potential for groundwater pollution caused by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>large numbers of burials in a short time</li>
  <li>the cumulative effects of many burials over a longer period of time</li>
  <li>novel or unproven burial practices</li>
  <li>site specific environmental factors</li>
  <li>a lack of appropriate operational controls</li>
</ul>

<p>If pollution happens, the Environment Agency will take action. This will be proportionate and appropriate to the harm being caused.</p>

<p>Large numbers of burials in environmentally sensitive locations cause the greatest concern. In many of these locations cemetery developers and operators need ongoing controls to reduce the risks to the environment. This is especially so in areas where the groundwater:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is vulnerable to pollution</li>
  <li>is used locally as a source of drinking water</li>
  <li>supports nearby sensitive surface waters or wetland habitats</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency encourages cemetery developers and operators not to propose developments in areas where the groundwater is highly vulnerable (wherever possible). They should avoid development proposals that present a high risk to the water environment.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/groundwater-protection-position-statements">The Environment Agency’s approach to groundwater protection</a> (Section L: Cemetery developments).</p>

<p>Higher risk cemeteries include proposed developments with a high burial rate in a vulnerable groundwater area (see statement L3).</p>

<p>Cemeteries located in the following places present an exceptional risk to the environment and human health:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/groundwater-source-protection-zones-spzs">Source Protection Zone 1 (SPZ1)</a>
</li>
  <li>within 250m from a well, borehole or spring used to supply water for human consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency is unlikely to grant an environmental permit for these developments (see statement L1).</p>

<p>You will need to carry out a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cemeteries-and-burials-groundwater-risk-assessments">risk assessment</a> to work out the risk from your proposed cemetery development. As a minimum, you must do a risk assessment to support your planning application. If you need to apply for an environmental permit (under the Environmental Permitting (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2016) you must also provide a risk assessment as part of your application.</p>

<p>To avoid groundwater pollution, local councils and other cemetery operators should follow the Environment Agency’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimum good practice groundwater protection requirements for all burial sites</li>
  <li>advice and recommendations from any site specific groundwater risk assessments</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you do not need an environmental permit</h2>
<p>Local councils (or other cemetery operators) do not need to apply for an environmental permit for existing cemeteries if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they do not need to use active mitigation measures to prevent pollution</li>
  <li>they are not planning to expand a cemetery area after 1 April 2022 which needs new planning permission under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</li>
  <li>they are planning to expand a cemetery area after 1 April 2022 which needs new planning permission, but the risk assessment shows that the expansion is not high risk and the Environment Agency has agreed this</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency has told them, as part of their planning application, that they do not need a permit</li>
</ul>

<p>You also do not need an environment permit if all burials on existing sites are of human ashes from crematoria.</p>

<p>Active mitigation measures to prevent pollution to the environment could include, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ongoing groundwater monitoring</li>
  <li>active groundwater drainage controls to allow burials</li>
</ul>

<p>All existing cemeteries that do not need an environmental permit should still aim to meet the minimum good practice groundwater protection requirements.</p>

<h2>Minimum good practice groundwater protection requirements</h2>
<p>If you operate an existing cemetery, or are proposing a new cemetery that does not require a permit, you should aim to meet the following minimum good practice groundwater protection requirements.</p>

<h3>Requirement 1</h3>
<p>You should not carry out any human burials within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a groundwater <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/groundwater-source-protection-zones-spzs">SPZ1</a>
</li>
  <li>10m of the nearest land drain</li>
  <li>30m from the nearest watercourse (which includes ditches and open land drains which may run dry for part of the year) or any other surface water</li>
  <li>50m of any well, spring or borehole, irrespective of that water’s current use</li>
  <li>250m of any well, spring or borehole where the water is intended for human consumption or used in food production</li>
  <li>areas identified as having karstic groundwater flow characteristics (following any required groundwater risk assessment) – these areas are highly vulnerable to pollution because groundwater can flow rapidly through the many fissures and fractures present in these rocks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirement 2</h3>
<p>You should not carry out any human burials on land which is liable to flooding.</p>

<h3>Requirement 3</h3>
<p>You should make the base of each grave at least 1 metre above the highest anticipated annual groundwater level.</p>

<h3>Requirement 4</h3>
<p>You should not dig graves in unaltered or unweathered bedrock. This is solid rock which can be buried or exposed at the earth’s surface, and which has not been altered by physical or chemical reactions (or both) such as exposure to the weather.</p>

<h2>When you will need an environmental permit</h2>
<p>From 1 April 2022, you will need to apply for an environmental permit for a new cemetery development or extension to an existing cemetery if any of these apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it presents a high risk to the environment due to its proposed location</li>
  <li>your site needs active pollution prevention mitigation measures or operational burial controls to protect the water environment</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency told you during the coronavirus pandemic that you would need to apply for a permit</li>
  <li>you submitted a planning application on or after 1 April 2022 and the Environment Agency told you that you would need to apply for a permit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying for a permit</h3>
<p>To apply for a new, bespoke, groundwater activity permit for a human cemetery, fill in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/application-for-an-environmental-permit-part-b9-bespoke-groundwater-activity-for-a-human-cemetery">Part B9 form</a>.</p>

<p>You must also fill in part:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-an-environmental-permit-part-a-about-you">A: about you</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-an-environmental-permit-part-f1-opra-charges-declarations">F1: charges and declarations</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to use an Adobe Acrobat Reader product to complete the forms.</p>

<p>It costs £2,708 to apply for a new bespoke permit. This is a one-off application fee you must pay when you apply.</p>

<p>There is also an annual subsistence charge, depending on the numbers of burials a year. It is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£256 for up to and including 1,430 burials a year</li>
  <li>£812 for over 1,430 burials a year</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the Environment Agency has granted your permit, if you wish to change (vary) its conditions, you will have to pay the following variation charges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£812 for a minor variation to the permit</li>
  <li>£1,354 normal variation</li>
  <li>£2,437 substantial variation</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact the Environment Agency for more information about varying your permit.</p>

<h2>Groundwater risk assessment</h2>
<p>As part of your planning application or permit application, you must carry out a groundwater risk assessment. A groundwater risk assessment will provide you with a site specific analysis of the risks your activity may pose. The Environment Agency will use this to help you operate your cemetery and protect the water environment.</p>

<p>At the planning stage, your risk assessment may indicate that you need to apply for an environmental permit for your site.</p>

<p>More information on how to carry out a risk assessment is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cemeteries-and-burials-groundwater-risk-assessments">Cemeteries and burials: groundwater risk assessments</a>.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency uses a proportionate approach when assessing groundwater risk assessments. The risk for each site will depend on a number of factors, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vulnerability and sensitivity of the underlying groundwater</li>
  <li>depth to the water table</li>
  <li>proximity of groundwater abstractions, particularly those used for drinking water or food production purposes</li>
  <li>proximity to watercourses and wetland habitats</li>
  <li>aquifer type and local hydrogeological conditions</li>
  <li>number and density of burials</li>
  <li>burial techniques employed</li>
</ul>

<p>Aquifer types, and other hydrogeological terms like unproductive strata, are explained in the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution/protect-groundwater-and-prevent-groundwater-pollution">Protect groundwater and prevent groundwater pollution</a>.</p>

<p>You can view the Environment Agency’s <abbr title="Source protection zone">SPZ</abbr> and aquifer designation areas on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx" rel="external">Magic Map</a>.</p>

<h2>High risk cemetery developments</h2>
<p>Carrying out the risk assessment as part of your permit application will allow the Environment Agency to assess the suitability of a cemetery proposal from a groundwater protection perspective.</p>

<p>If the Environment Agency considers the proposed development presents a significantly high risk of pollution to groundwater, they will either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advise you to avoid carrying out the development</li>
  <li>allow you to carry out the development but under the controls required by an environmental permit, in order to reduce the risk</li>
</ul>

<p>High risk developments are those that present a significant risk of pollution to groundwater and will generally need active mitigation measures to reduce that risk.</p>

<h2>If you cannot comply with this guidance</h2>
<p>If you cannot comply with this guidance the Environment Agency may take appropriate enforcement action against you if you cause, are likely to cause, or knowingly permit groundwater pollution.</p>
