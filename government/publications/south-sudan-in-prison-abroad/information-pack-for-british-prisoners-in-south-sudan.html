<h2>Chapter 1: Key points</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>If you are a British national, and are arrested or detained in another country, consular staff will do what they can to help you, but they cannot interfere with the local justice system, get you out of jail, or pay for services such as a lawyer.  See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">information about who we can help</a>, including the circumstances in which we can assist dual nationals.</p>

<p>This detention information pack is designed to give you, and your family and friends, information about the local system in South Sudan and who can help. A printed copy is provided to those in prison or in custody. We welcome feedback to help us improve the information we can provide to others.</p>

<h3>Contacting us</h3>

<p>If you are arrested or detained in another country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the authorities should ask whether you want them to contact the British Consulate (and must do so if you want them to)</li>
  <li>you can make the request yourself, and should do so, even if they do not ask,  particularly if you are charged with a serious offence or need any kind of assistance</li>
  <li>friends or family can also contact the local British Consulate or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) in London on +44 (0)20 7008 5000</li>
</ul>

<p>In some countries, the authorities might notify the British Consulate even if you don’t want anyone to know that you have been arrested. This is because there may be an agreement in place with the British Government which requires a mandatory notification to be made.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>

<p>Consular staff work in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London, and in British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates overseas.</p>

<p>There are no consular staff at the British Embassy in Juba. Consular assistance is provided remotely by the British High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>

</div>

<p>You can also contact us by phone 24/7 for help or advice from anywhere in the world by calling the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office on 020 7008 5000.</p>

<h3>What we can do</h3>

<p>The FCDO can offer you impartial and non-judgemental help. Once notified of your arrest or detention, consular staff will aim to contact you as soon as possible so that we can assess how we can help you. We then aim to provide assistance according to your individual circumstances and local conditions. Our priority is to provide assistance to those British nationals overseas that need our help the most.</p>

<p>In South Sudan, notification by the authorities to the Embassy normally does not take place. Once we are notified, we aim to contact you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-sudan-lawyers/south-sudan-list-of-lawyers">list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>
</li>
  <li>provide general information about the country, detention conditions and the local legal system (including if legal aid is available)</li>
  <li>provide general information about the local prison or remand system, including visiting arrangements, mail and censorship, privileges and welfare services</li>
  <li>keep in regular contact with you by telephone – the frequency of contact will depend on local conditions and your personal circumstances</li>
  <li>tell the police or prison doctor, with your permission, about any medical or dental problems including medication</li>
  <li>put you, or your family, in touch with a prisoners’ welfare charity called <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>
</li>
  <li>in some circumstances, be able to help take up complaints with the police or prison authorities about ill treatment, personal safety, or discrimination, if you are not treated in line with internationally recognised standards</li>
  <li>help to transfer money to you from your friends or family. In places where phone or postal services aren’t available, we can also pass on messages and deliver letters to the prison (but generally we cannot arrange for delivery directly to you)</li>
</ul>

<p>What we can’t do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get you out of prison or detention</li>
  <li>help you get special treatment</li>
  <li>offer legal advice, start legal proceedings or investigate a crime</li>
  <li>pay for any costs as a result of being arrested</li>
  <li>forward you packages sent by friends or family</li>
  <li>prevent authorities from deporting you after release</li>
</ul>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<h3>Can you / will you tell my family?</h3>

<p>If you want us to, we can tell your family or friends that you have been detained and can provide them with information about how to contact you in prison or detention.  With your consent, we can also keep them updated on your well-being.</p>

<p>If you are not sure about informing your family, we can help you consider the impact that not doing so might have. For example, it may cause them distress if they do not know where you are, or cannot contact you. It can also be a disadvantage to you if you need someone to send you money or act on your behalf while you are detained.</p>

<h3>Will the UK Police be informed?</h3>

<p>If you are accused of certain serious offences, such as sexual assault or drugs trafficking, we are obliged to share information about your arrest with UK police. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer. There may be other circumstances in which information about you may need to be shared by ourselves or authorities in South Sudan.</p>

<h3>Do I need a lawyer?  / How can I find a lawyer?</h3>

<p>Although we cannot give legal advice, start legal proceedings, or investigate a crime, we can offer basic information about the local legal system, including whether a legal aid scheme is available. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-sudan-lawyers/south-sudan-list-of-lawyers">list of local English-speaking lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>You will want to consider the benefits of local legal representation and to discuss all the costs beforehand with the legal representative. In no circumstances can we pay your legal or interpretation costs.</p>

<h3>Can you get me out?</h3>

<p>We cannot get you out of prison or detention, nor can we get special treatment for you because you are British. However if you are not treated in line with internationally accepted standards we will consider whether to approach local authorities. This may include if your trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

<h3>Who else can help me?</h3>

<p>We can put you, or your family, in touch with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a>, a UK charity which supports British citizens detained overseas and their families.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: Detention conditions in South Sudan</h2>

<h3>Visits: friends and family</h3>

<h4>Can my family and friends visit me? How can I arrange a visit?</h4>

<p>Family and friends are permitted to visit inmates in person, but all visits must be prearranged. If your family and friends decide to visit you, they can arrange this directly with the prison authorities.</p>

<p>We can provide guidance on visiting the prison, and what they can and cannot take in. You should advise any potential UK visitors to contact us via the FCDO in London, giving as much notice as possible.</p>

<p>Each prison has its own rules regarding visits and prison authorities may refuse visits by non-relatives. The prison can also refuse visitors if you are being disciplined because of bad behaviour, or if a visit will prejudice your court case.</p>

<p>When your family notify us of their intention to visit you in prison, we will provide them with details of the number of visits allowed. If your family are travelling a long distance, such as from the UK, we can try to request extra visits for them. However, this cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h4>What can visitors expect?</h4>

<p>Visitors should arrive in good time during each visit, and should bring their passports or travel documents for identification purposes. For security reasons those persons will be checked as well as their belongings.</p>

<p>Internal regulations will establish the place, frequency and duration of ordinary visits and may be based on your behaviour, the prison’s security level and the spaces available for this purpose. It may also depend on your security classification and the offence for which you have been detained.</p>

<h4>What can visitors bring?</h4>

<p>Regulations about permitted items vary from one prison to another in South Sudan and the rules are frequently changed. Therefore, families should contact the FCDO in advance of their visit so we can enquire from the prison authorities what will be accepted.</p>

<h3>Visits: consular staff</h3>

<p>Consular assistance for individuals in South Sudan is provided remotely by the British High Commission in Nairobi. Contact with consular officials will therefore usually be by telephone.</p>

<p>We will aim to contact you within 24 hours of being notified of your arrest or detention to assess your situation. We will aim to contact you once before sentencing and quarterly after sentencing unless you are vulnerable.</p>

<p>During our routine conversations you will have the opportunity to discuss any health issues, security concerns, your treatment in prison and any other general issues that you wish to raise with our consular staff.</p>

<p>You can write to us at any time on matters of concern by completing our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-consulate-juba">contact form for consular enquiries</a>, but if it is urgent, it may be quicker to ask prison authorities to contact us on your behalf through the following telephone numbers +254 (0) 202 844 000 or +254 (0)202 873 000.</p>

<h3>Emergency trips outside of prison</h3>

<p>Prisoners are not allowed to make any trips outside of prison no matter how urgent the situation may be.</p>

<h2>Police custody and initial arrival at prison</h2>

<h3>Arrival at the police station and basic rights</h3>

<p>Once you have been arrested you will be taken to the relevant police station where you will be searched and placed in custody. When you arrive at police station you should be informed of your rights as an arrested person which include the reason for arrest and charges against you and your right to contact a lawyer of your choice.</p>

<p>You should be given the opportunity to contact the British Embassy. If this is not offered then you need to make a request. It is your right. In case of any language barriers, you have the right to be assisted by an official translator for free.</p>

<p>If you are charged with an offence and not released by police, the law provides that you should be taken to court within 24 hours. You may be detained for a further period with the consent of the court until the conclusion of investigation but this should not be for more than three months unless authorised by the relevant Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>When investigations are complete and charges have been filed, you should be transferred to prison for a period not exceeding one month while you await trial. 
Remember that you should never sign anything you cannot read. If you find yourself under pressure to sign any documents, ask to speak to your lawyer.</p>

<p>Those who are detained in police cells are not given food and as such they rely on well-wishers, relatives and friends to bring them food. The law provides that they have a right to obtain a reasonable amount of food stuff at their own cost.</p>

<h3>Appearance at court</h3>

<p>When investigations are complete and a charge has been framed you will be presented in court where you will be charged and the alleged offence read out to you. However, if investigations are not complete the prosecution may request the court for additional time to complete investigations before you can be formally charged in court.</p>

<p>More information about the South Sudan judicial system can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="#chapter-3-the-south-sudan-judicial-system">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<h3>Initial arrival at the prison</h3>

<p>Prisoners are searched upon arrival at prison. Any belongings that are not part of the investigation, process, or evidence will be bagged and kept in storage by the prison authorities and returned to you on release. It is not unusual for some belongings to go missing.</p>

<p>The British Embassy cannot store your personal belongings on your behalf. Your passport will usually be retained by the local authorities until the end of your sentence.</p>

<h3>Prison: conditions and daily life</h3>

<p>Prison conditions in South Sudan are considerably poorer than conditions in UK prisons. Most prisons in South Sudan lack basic infrastructure, especially outside of Juba, the state capital.</p>

<p>According to the Human Rights Watch report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/southsudan0612_insert_LOW_WITH_COVER.pdf" rel="external">“Prison Is Not For Me”: Arbitrary Detentions in South Sudan</a>, released in June 2012, prisons in South Sudan do not comply with international and domestic law and standards on prisoners’ welfare.</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>Prisons do not usually have different holding cells for various types of detainees such as those on remand, convicts, adults and children.</p>

<p>Overcrowding is a severe problem and there may be instances of lack of adequate meals, clean drinking water and electricity and poor sanitation.</p>

<h4>Food and diet</h4>

<p>The prison authorities state that the food they provide is a balanced diet giving the necessary daily nutritional requirements. A basic diet mostly consists of local food available in South Sudan such as sorghum, beans, bread and green vegetables.</p>

<p>Those in remand held either in police cells or prisons rely on well-wishers, relatives and friends to provide food. You can supplement your diet by buying food items from the prison shop, when available.</p>

<h4>Hygiene</h4>

<p>Shower/ bathing facilities are limited and water, soap and other sanitary supplies are insufficient. You can buy additional toiletries from the prison shop when available.</p>

<h4>Work and study</h4>

<p>Learning and development opportunities may vary from prison to prison but generally prisons have basic rehabilitation programs which are used to enable inmates to acquire skills such carpentry, crafts and hair dressing.</p>

<p>Study opportunities may also be available and the prison will usually offer the South Sudanese educational curriculum. Consular staff can request full details of this as soon as a person is assigned to a facility.</p>

<h4>Contact and languages</h4>

<p>Prisoners are allowed to interact with others unless one is isolated as a form of punishment or due to other reasons.</p>

<p>English and Arabic are widely spoken by the prison guards. Detainees do not have direct access to phones, writing materials and the internet, however these can be accessed through the prison office.</p>

<p>While English books are available, their supply is inadequate. There is the possibility to request local language materials through the post from Prisoners Abroad (including language textbooks and dictionaries).</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>

<p>Prisons in South Sudan are basic and leisure facilities are limited. Prisoners are permitted to move around occasionally.</p>

<h4>Climate</h4>

<p>South Sudan experiences a tropical climate which is hot all year round. Temperature averages are normally above 25°C, with highs exceeding 35°C, particularly during the dry season (January to April) while it is humid during the rainy season.</p>

<h4>Religion</h4>

<p>Prisoners have freedom of worship and the right to receive visits from a priest, rabbi or minister of faith. Prisons also have religious ministers attached to them.</p>

<h4>Rules and regulations (including drugs)</h4>

<p>Any type of drug trafficking in prison is an offence punishable in law. It is also illegal to take illegal drugs and cigarettes in prison. If you are caught with illegal drugs or cigarettes you will be punished accordingly.</p>

<h3>Prison: access to help and services</h3>

<h4>How can I receive money?</h4>

<p>There are 2 ways in which you may be able to receive financial assistance while in prison.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Private Funds: deposited to you by your family or friends.</li>
  <li>Prisoners Abroad: depending on where you are detained, if your family can’t support you financially, Prisoners Abroad may be able to send you a small grant every quarter for essentials (enough for one hot meal a day).</li>
</ol>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The British Government does not provide financial assistance to prisoners.</p>
</div>

<h4>Private funds</h4>

<p>While the FCDO does not provide financial assistance to prisoners, we may be able, within certain limits, to send you money from your family.</p>

<p>The Foreign Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (FCDO) operates a “Prison Comfort” system for money transfers to prisoners. Please ask your family to get in touch with the FCDO in order to arrange this.</p>

<p>We are unable to receive payment by credit or debit card, or by cash.</p>

<h4>Prisoners Abroad</h4>

<p>In addition, Prisoners Abroad, a UK charity, may be able to assist you with funding for prison essentials and some medical care if you are not in receipt of any regular donations from other sources. <a class="govuk-link" href="#chapter-four-additional-information">See Chapter 4 for more details</a>.</p>

<p>Money received from the UK will be converted into local currency and held on your behalf by the High Commission. Our consular staff will then transfer your funds to the Prisons Welfare officer once a month. Any cash you receive will not be handed over to you. All cash is kept by the Welfare Office. You are not allowed to keep cash while in prison.</p>

<p>Please note that our consular staff cannot be responsible for the loss of funds by the prison authorities.</p>

<h4>Can I receive medical and dental treatment?</h4>

<p>While you are in detention, South Sudan is responsible for ensuring your basic medical needs are met. If you need medical or dental treatment, you should make an appointment to see the prison medical officer who will provide routine treatment.</p>

<p>For more serious complaints you should be referred to the nearest public hospital.
Medical services are offered free of charge but as the government system is relatively overwhelmed you may have to buy your own medicine.</p>

<p>With your permission, we can make sure that any medical or dental problems you might have are brought to the attention of any police or prison doctor. We can also liaise with your GP in the UK, if the police or prison doctor requests previous medical records and this is in your vital interests.</p>

<h4>Mail/ Parcels</h4>

<p>You can receive parcels from your family with permission from the prison authorities. Please be aware that parcels should be sent directly to the prison; parcels sent to the High Commission will not be forwarded to you. Parcels must have the name and details of the sender.</p>

<h4>Can I make telephone calls?</h4>

<p>Prisoners are not allowed to have phones. All phone calls must be made from the prison office with permission from prison authorities and using their telephone. If you are caught trying to use a mobile phone inside the prison you will be punished according to the prison’s regulations and you may be sent to confinement for a period of time.</p>

<h4>How can I make a complaint about mistreatment?</h4>

<p>If you have been mistreated, please inform consular staff as soon as it is safe for you to do so. We will then do our best to visit you, to check on your welfare, discuss the allegations, and inform you of any local complaints procedures and supportive organisations that you may wish to consider.</p>

<p>With your permission, and where appropriate, we will consider approaching the local authorities if you have not been treated in line with internationally-accepted standards. If you have been mistreated, please try to see a doctor, obtain a medical report and if possible photos of the injuries you received.</p>

<p>You can also inform your lawyer or the Human Rights Commissioner during inspections of jails about police treatment or the Magistrate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: the South Sudan judicial system</h2>

<h3>Overview and first steps</h3>

<h4>Is the system the same as the UK?</h4>

<p>The South Sudanese Judicial System and the UK Judicial System have some similarities. For example, under the constitution, prisoners are presumed innocent until proven guilty; they have a right to legal representation, interpreter, fair trial and appeal. However there are fundamental differences.</p>

<p>For example, the South Sudanese judicial system is extremely backlogged. Insufficient staffing and a lack of resources mean it is extremely hard to achieve anything quickly. Prisoners can remain in prison without sentence for considerable periods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FCDO cannot interfere with the judicial system. We cannot ask for your case to be judged more quickly just because you are British, or ask the authorities to waive any penalties.</p>
</div>

<h4>What should happen when I am arrested?</h4>

<p>If you are arrested or detained you should be informed immediately, in a language that you understand, of the reasons for your arrest and your rights as an arrested person. You should inform the authorities if you wish the British Embassy to be informed of your arrest.</p>

<p>You will usually be taken to a holding cell or detention centre and if you are not released on bond you should be produced in court within 24 hours where you will either be remanded in custody or granted bail by the court.</p>

<p>Should you have any questions concerning the legal aspects of your arrest, contact your lawyer. See list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-sudan-lawyers/south-sudan-list-of-lawyers">local English-speaking lawyers</a>.</p>

<h4>For how long can I be remanded in custody?</h4>

<p>You should only be remanded in custody whilst the authorities conduct their investigation. You will be presented to court periodically, and the prosecutor has to satisfy the court that your continued detention is justified. The police can remand you for purposes of investigation for a maximum of 24 hours, the Public Prosecution Attorney for 7 days and a magistrate or court for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Except with the approval of the competent President of the Court of Appeal, no arrested person should be detained for a period exceeding 3 months. However, you have the right to seek bail at the conclusion of investigation.</p>

<p>A magistrate or Court can also remand you for the purpose of trial for a period not exceeding 6 months unless authorised by the President of the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>If you believe that the time spent on remand is excessive, this should be raised with your lawyer. If your lawyer feels that this time is outside of the scope of the local law and/or they felt due process had not been followed, we along with our legal advisers would then be able to consider whether this presents us with sufficient grounds to intervene under international law.</p>

<h4>What happens when I am charged?</h4>

<p>You must be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction. The preliminary court appearance shall be at the magistrate court or high court, depending on the nature of offence.</p>

<p>In the first hearing, the statement of the investigator will be presented under oath. The statement of the detainee is read out and he/she confirms or denies in part or wholly. The investigator is examined by the prosecutor and cross-examined by the defence. 
The charge sheet will be read to the accused and the accused will be given the chance to plead guilty or not.</p>

<p>The courts will inform you, your lawyer and, if applicable the prison, of their decision. 
You will be remanded in custody for the whole process until you receive your sentence or are acquitted. Court proceedings in South Sudan can take a long time to be completed.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for bail?</h4>

<p>Most detainees have a right to apply for bail but there are exceptions. For example, a person accused of an offence punishable with death cannot be released on bail and a person accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding ten years is not ordinarily released on bail.</p>

<p>The decision to grant bail rests with the magistrate or judge and the defendant’s lawyer is responsible for submitting this application to the court. Bail cannot be considered during the First Hearing until investigation is concluded.</p>

<p>If your application for bail is denied in the first instance you have the right to appeal. It is important to note that bail comes with conditions that may include depositing your passport with the authorities until the conclusion of your case.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The FCDO is not able to facilitate the transfer of bail funds.</p>
</div>

<h2>Trial and legal assistance</h2>

<h3>What kind of legal assistance is available?</h3>

<p>The South Sudanese authorities will expect you to engage and pay for a lawyer yourself. You can hire a lawyer at any time after your arrest. If you wish to hire a private lawyer, see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/south-sudan-lawyers/south-sudan-list-of-lawyers">list of English-speaking lawyers</a>. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/" rel="external">Prisoners Abroad</a> can also supply information on legal aid, court proceedings and can advise on appointing a lawyer.</p>

<p>If you are unable to afford a lawyer, free legal advice should be given to you at your request. However, in practice, state-appointed legal advice is usually limited to those charged with serious offences. Interviews can be conducted without the presence of a lawyer until your first court hearing.</p>

<h3>What happens at the trial?</h3>

<p>On the day of your trial you will be taken to the court where your case is being heard. There will be a magistrate or judge in charge of your case along with the Public Prosecution Attorney and your lawyer or Public Defender.</p>

<p>At this stage the jurisdiction of the court has already been confirmed and the case will be prosecuted. Statements on oath of the investigator, complainant/prosecution and statements of the witnesses will be read out and cross examination done.</p>

<p>After that the court will examine the accused, confession (if applicable) will be read to the accused and if there is no evidence against the accused, the case should be dismissed.</p>

<h3>Sentences</h3>

<p>Sentencing guidelines are set out in South Sudan’s Penal Code. The penalty for an offence can range from a reprimand to a fine and/or a prison sentence.</p>

<h3>How can appeals be made?</h3>

<p>Any aggrieved party can appeal and every appeal or petition of appeal should be presented within 15 days after the pronouncement of a sentence or the making of an order.</p>

<h3>Reaching the end of your sentence</h3>

<h4>What provision is there for reduction of sentence (remission) e.g. for good behaviour?</h4>

<p>Suspension of a sentence or emission can be granted on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice. It may be granted with or without conditions.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for early release e.g. on parole?</h4>

<p>To qualify for early release, your sentence must be below seven years. The offender must have no previous sentence of an imprisonment exceeding 6 months. When considering early release, the court also considers the age, character and history of the offender.</p>

<h4>What provision is there for clemency or pardon?</h4>

<p>Pardon and clemency can only be granted by the President of South Sudan.</p>

<h4>What about any financial penalties?</h4>

<p>Depending on the offence, fines are part of the sentencing system; especially in civil cases.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to another prison within South Sudan possible?</h4>

<p>The prison authorities can impose transfers between prisons in South Sudan for disciplinary or overcrowding reasons. This is an internal administrative procedure by the prison authorities.</p>

<h4>Is transfer to the UK a possibility?</h4>

<p>No. The UK does not have a Prisoner Transfer Agreement with South Sudan.</p>

<h4>What are the procedures for release and deportation?</h4>

<p>Any British Citizen serving a prison term may be liable for deportation to the UK at the end of that term.</p>

<p>If you are to be deported, at the end of your prison sentence you will be released into the custody of the South Sudanese Immigration authorities, who will hold you in immigration detention whilst they arrange your deportation. This may only take a matter of days, especially if your passport is still valid.</p>

<p>However, if your passport has expired, or has less than 6 months validity remaining, you might need to obtain a new passport or an Emergency Travel Document before you can be deported. This could take several days, depending on what documentation you have. To avoid deportation delays, we recommend that you check your passport status well in advance of your release and deportation.</p>

<p>If you are deported, you may be excluded from returning to South Sudan for a given period. Depending on the severity of the offence you were imprisoned for, this might be a permanent exclusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes people find that they face difficulties adjusting to life in the UK once they have left prison. You may find yourself ready for life on the outside but not prepared for living in the UK. Possibly you have never lived in the UK and have no connections there, or perhaps you have lost touch with friends and family. You may simply want to talk to another person who understands what you have been through, to help you consider what to do next.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Prisoners Abroad you can visit Prisoners Abroad when you first arrive back in UK for advice, to take a shower, use their temporary luggage store, make essential phone calls or use a computer. If you have no belongings Prisoners Abroad may be able to help with basic toiletries and finding suitable clothing. If you know your release date in advance it is best to write and tell your caseworker when you are likely to arrive and what help you think you might need.</p>

<p>If you have no money and nowhere to go, Prisoners Abroad’s Aftercare Service can help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>advice on finding emergency accommodation in the London area</li>
  <li>claiming welfare benefits, including emergency benefit payments if you are destitute</li>
  <li>making appointments with doctors and dentists</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with local agencies if you are not returning to the London area</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on you may want advice on housing, looking for work, applying for training or getting counselling. Prisoners Abroad can refer you to the right agency.</p>

<p>Other sources of practical help back in the UK are The Salvation Army – UK Helpline 020 7367 4888, Monday to Friday 08h00 to 16h00, or contact your local Salvation Army branch – and The Prison Fellowship, UK Helpline 020 7799 2500, Monday to Friday 09h00 to 17h00.</p>

<h4>Would I have a criminal record in the UK?</h4>

<p>We will not normally pass on information about your case to a third party without your consent. However, if you’re arrested for certain serious offences, such as child sex abuse or drugs crimes, our staff must tell other relevant UK authorities. It is therefore possible that information about this may appear if a Criminal Records Bureau check were carried out by a prospective employer.</p>
