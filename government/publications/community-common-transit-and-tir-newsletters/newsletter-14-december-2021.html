<h2>Errors with transit declarations originating from Great Britain</h2>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters/newsletter-1-january-2021">Newsletter 1 – January 2021</a>, HMRC reminded you of the requirement to declare an Office of Transit within departure declarations from 1 January 2021 once the UK became a contracting party to the Common Transit Convention (<abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr>).</p>

<p>For goods moving under transit, to comply with <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> and avoid any delays at international borders, declarations need to be completed correctly. Some transit declarations are being completed with the Office of Transit in the wrong country (exit points rather than entry points) or not at all, which causes delays at the borders. This newsletter reminds traders of these changes and will help them avoid making errors when completing transit declarations.</p>

<h3>You must now declare an EU Office of Transit when moving goods using common transit</h3>

<p>Since 1 January 2021, import and export declarations are now required for all goods moved between Great Britain and the EU. The UK is also now an independent member of the <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr>. This means that there are new rules you need to follow when making your transit declarations for movements between Great Britain and the EU, or between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>In this newsletter, we explain the requirements that mean you must now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>declare an EU or Northern Irish Office of Transit in your transit declarations</li>
  <li>declare an Office of Transit when your movement will continue beyond the EU and enter another <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country</li>
  <li>declare at least 2 Offices of Transit when you move goods between 2 locations in Great Britain through the EU</li>
  <li>declare an Office of Transit when you move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>diverting your movement to a different Office of Transit</li>
  <li>where to find Office of Transit codes</li>
  <li>information for hauliers on how to visit an Office of Transit in Great Britain or Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>where you can get more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Declare an EU or Northern Irish Office of Transit in your transit declarations</h3>

<p>If you are moving goods into a new customs territory you must visit an Office of Transit when you enter that territory. The Office of Transit is the nearest customs office to the point where your goods enter the new territory. All ports and airports in Great Britain and Northern Ireland that are able to receive transit movements will act as Offices of Transit.</p>

<p>You must now visit an Office of Transit on entry into the EU or Northern Ireland for all transit movements coming from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great Britain mainland (England, Scotland and Wales)</li>
  <li>Guernsey</li>
  <li>Jersey</li>
  <li>Isle of Man</li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need to visit another Office of Transit if you exit the EU or Northern Ireland and pass into another customs territory.</p>

<p>When making a transit declaration, you need to enter details of every Office of Transit that your goods will need to visit between the Office of Departure and the Office of Destination. This includes each Office of Transit you intend to use for entry into every customs territory your goods will enter or cross during their journey. It’s important that you use the correct reference code for the Office of Transit you intend to use in your transit declarations, otherwise your goods may be delayed on their journey.</p>

<p>The Office of Transit you enter on the transit declaration is first one that the driver intends to pass through in the next customs area (the point where they will enter either the EU or any other <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/common-transit-convention-countries"><abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country</a> after leaving Great Britain). The Office of Transit is not the port where the movement leaves Great Britain.</p>

<p>Further information on Office of Transit obligations can be found in the Transit Manual Supplement.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transit-manual-supplement">Guidance overview: Transit Manual Supplement</a> section 3.5 Formalities at Office of Transit.</p>

<h3>Declare an Office of Transit when your movement will continue beyond the EU and enter another <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country</h3>

<p>If your transit movement leaves the EU and enters another <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country, (example Norway, Switzerland or Turkey), the goods will have to visit another Office of Transit. The Office of Transit you enter on the transit declaration should be the first one you intend to pass through in that <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country.</p>

<p>If your transit movement leaves the EU, enters a <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country, and then re-enters the EU – for example, goods crossing from France into Switzerland and then entering Italy. Then the goods will need to be taken to one Office of Transit where the movement enters Switzerland, and another one on the Italian side of the border when they re-enter the EU.</p>

<h3>Declare at least 2 Offices of Transit when you move goods between 2 locations in Great Britain through the EU</h3>

<p>Transit can also be used to move goods between 2 locations in Great Britain but travelling across the EU. In these cases, the goods will now need to be taken to an Office of Transit when the goods enter the EU, and another one when they re-enter Great Britain.</p>

<p>A transit declaration for a consignment of vegetables moving from Jersey to Great Britain via France would need to show one Office of Transit for the port where the goods are due to enter France, and a second Office of Transit for the port where the goods are due to enter Great Britain.</p>

<h3>Declare an Office of Transit when you move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If you move goods under transit between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the goods will need to be taken to an Office of Transit. You will need to enter the Office of Transit where your goods will enter either Northern Ireland or Great Britain.</p>

<p>The customs office codes for all Office of Transit in the UK (both the ones in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland) can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit">UK Customs Office List</a>.</p>

<h3>Diverting your movement to a different Office of Transit</h3>

<p>All transit movements entering either the EU or Northern Ireland from Great Britain must now go through an Office of Transit on entry to Northern Ireland or at the EU border. If you do not know which Office of Transit you or your haulier will use to enter the EU or Northern Ireland, you should use the one you think you are most likely to arrive at.</p>

<p>Unless you have chosen some prescribed itinerary restrictions for your movement when you made your transit declaration, it’s possible for your transit movement to arrive at an Office of Transit other than the one declared on your transit declaration.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transit-manual-supplement">Guidance overview: Transit Manual Supplement</a> section 3.5.2 Diversion to a different Office of Transit.</p>

<h2>Office of Transit codes</h2>

<p>We have provided a list of some of Offices of Transit and their reference codes for the most commonly used routes.</p>

<h4>France</h4>

<p>The Offices of Transit available in France for goods arriving from Great Britain have been published by the French customs authorities and are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dunkerque ferry (FR590002)</li>
  <li>Calais port tunnel (FR620001)</li>
  <li>Rouen (FR003920)</li>
  <li>Caen (FR000720)</li>
  <li>Le Havre port CREPS (FRD02300)</li>
  <li>Cherbourg (FR000950)</li>
  <li>Saint-Malo (FR004060)</li>
  <li>Brest bureau (FR000690)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://wiki.unece.org/download/attachments/101548543/brexit-note-aux-operateurs-traduction-en-reminder-regarding-transit-declarations-procedures-entrance-and-exit-160621.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1624281775667&amp;api=v2" rel="external">French Offices of Transit published in English by Douane authorities in France</a>.</p>

<h4>Entering France at locations with a smart border</h4>

<p>If you enter France at a location with a ‘smart border’, and it is not the Office of Transit entered in your declaration, you may be directed into the orange lanes for manual intervention, which could cause delays to your journey. It’s important for all traders to enter the correct Office of Transit in their declaration to avoid risk of delay.</p>

<h4>Vehicles departing from Dover</h4>

<p>For vehicles departing from Dover, which may arrive at either the Offices of Transit at Calais Port et Tunnel or Dunkerque Ferry, it’s no longer necessary to enter both Offices of Transit in the declaration. Instead, you should declare the Office of Transit at which the vehicle is most likely to arrive.</p>

<h4>Netherlands</h4>

<p>Europort (Rotterdam) (NL000510)
			   (NL000511)</p>

<h4>Belgium</h4>

<p>Zeebrugge (BE343000)</p>

<h4>Ireland</h4>

<p>Dublin (IEDUB100)
Rosslare Harbour IEROS100</p>

<h4>Spain</h4>

<p>Santander (ES003911)</p>

<h3>Information for hauliers on how to visit an Office of Transit in Great Britain or Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>Goods moving under transit that enter Great Britain from the EU or Northern Ireland are all now required to visit an Office of Transit on entry to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Goods moving under transit will also need to visit an Office of Transit if they exit Great Britain and pass into another customs territory, including moving back into the EU or going to Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This means that goods must be taken to an Office of Transit for every transit movement which is entering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Great Britain from the EU or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/common-transit-convention-countries">another <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country</a>
</li>
  <li>Great Britain from Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland from a non-EU <abbr title="Common Transit Convention">CTC</abbr> country</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland from Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<p>When transit movements arrive in either Great Britain or Northern Ireland, the goods and the Transit Accompanying Document (<abbr title="Transit Accompanying Document">TAD</abbr>) must be presented at an Office of Transit. The UK government allows the Office of Transit process to be completed digitally, using the new goods vehicle movement service (<abbr title="goods vehicle movement service">GVMS</abbr>).</p>

<p>More information on how to complete the Office of Transit can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transporting-goods-between-great-britain-and-the-eu-by-roro-freight-guidance-for-hauliers#section-5b">section 5.b of the Haulier Handbook</a>.</p>
