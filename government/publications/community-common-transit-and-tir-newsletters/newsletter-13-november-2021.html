<h2>Closure of the existing New Computerised Transit System (<abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>) XML and email channels</h2>

<p>HMRC have changed plans to close the legacy XML channel on 30 November 2021, this will now take place on 28 February 2022.</p>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters/newsletter-9-september-2021">Newsletter 9 – September 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters/newsletter-7-july-2021" class="govuk-link">Newsletter - 7 July 2021</a>, we explained that to enable HMRC to manage the increase in messages to the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> between the UK and the EU we will be closing the legacy XML channel and replacing it with the new XML Application Programming Interface (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>) that went live on 31 March 2021 for Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and 13 May 2021 for Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>This is a critical change which must be made as the legacy channel is no longer able to manage current volumes.</p>

<p>While a lot of progress has been made and we are seeing a transition to use the new channels, we are aware of challenges for software developers and traders in meeting the original 30 November 2021 deadline for closing the legacy XML channel.</p>

<p>Due to these challenges, and the busy time period we are entering at the end of 2021, we are aligning the decommissioning of the legacy XML with the decommissioning date of 28 February 2022 recently announced for email.</p>

<p>This date of 28 February 2022  represents the end point for submission to either channel.</p>

<p>It is vital that this work is completed as soon as possible as the legacy channels stability is under increasing strain and these stability issues will continue to increase.</p>

<p>After 28 February 2022 you will need to use either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>software compatible with the new XML <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> channel</li>
  <li>the free-to-use HMRC online portal</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be the case for all Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland movements.</p>

<p>If your software currently uses either the legacy XML or email channel to send messages, you must take action.</p>

<p>You should check with your software provider which channel your software is currently using, and whether you need to take any action to upgrade to software compatible with the new XML <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> channel.</p>

<h3>Action to take now if you are using either the legacy XML or email channel to access the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>You need to check with your software provider urgently to what these changes mean for you and what action you need to take.</p>

<p>If you are not currently registered to use <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> you will need to allow sufficient time for your registration to be processed.</p>

<p>You should also check with your software provider to make sure you have all the relevant information you may need to log in, for example, Government Gateway credentials.</p>

<p>You must make sure you have made any necessary software upgrades and will be ready to use the new software package, as you will not be able to make any declarations using the current legacy XML channel or the email channel after 28 February 2022.</p>

<p>The only alternative to the new XML <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> channel is the free-to-use HMRC online portal.</p>
