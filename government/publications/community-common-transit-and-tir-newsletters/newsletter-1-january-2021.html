<p>In Transit Newsletter 3 – November 2020, we reminded you that the changes identified in Customs Information Paper (CIP 7), ‘New Computerised Transit System Transit Declaration Completion’ relating to the UK becoming a contracting party to the Common Transit Convention would apply from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>This included the requirement to declare an Office of Transit within departure declarations.</p>

<p>Offices of Transit occur at borders between the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and a third country, for example, a non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country or at borders between two third countries.</p>

<p>An Office of Transit must be declared at the point of entry into the new territory.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, all declarations for transit movements that start from Great Britain mainland and crown dependencies need to include an Office of Transit. For transit movements that start in Northern Ireland, an Office of Transit must be declared where the movement crosses Great Britain (land bridge) en route to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or enters any non-<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> country.</p>

<h2>The importance of declaring the correct Office of Transit</h2>

<p>Including the Office of Transit in your departure declaration makes sure that the office you intend your movement to go through as it crosses a border will get advanced notification of your movement. This will allow customs in the territory your movement is due to enter to carry out advanced checks as needed.</p>

<p>Failure to declare the correct Office of Transit may result in your movement being delayed at the point of border crossing.</p>

<h2>Checking a Customs Office operates as an Office of Transit</h2>

<p>You can check if any Customs Office that your movement will pass through at a border operates as an Office of Transit by searching the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/col/col_search_home.jsp?Lang=en" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Europa Customs Office List</a>. You can search by office name or reference number. The Office details held include name and address, opening hours and the roles that a specific office holds.</p>

<p>If the office is showing as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘TRA’ it’s role is an Office of Transit</li>
  <li>‘DEP’ it’s role is an Office of Departure</li>
  <li>‘DES’ it’s role is an Office of Destination</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Office of Transit in Departure Declarations</h2>

<p>It is essential that you use the correct Office of Transit in your departure declarations.</p>

<h3>Great Britain and crown dependencies</h3>

<p>The Office of Transit you declare should be the first Office of Transit encountered in the territory that the movement enters after leaving Great Britain. It is not the port where the movement leaves from Great Britain.</p>

<p>For example, if a movement starts from Great Britain, crossing to France using the Eurotunnel, the first Office of Transit it will encounter is Calais FR620001, so this is the Office of Transit that should be entered on the departure declaration.</p>

<p>If a movement starts from Great Britain and crosses to Northern Ireland (either as destination or continuing onward to Eire), then the first Office of Transit it encounters in Northern Ireland – which might be XI000142 Belfast for example - this should be entered as the Office of Transit on the departure declaration.</p>

<p>For national movements only, for example Great Britain to Great Britain, you should use the Office of Destination as the Office of Transit, so the Office of Destination and Office of Transit should be the same.</p>

<h3>Northern Ireland</h3>

<p>If a movement starts from Northern Ireland, crossing to Great Britain using a ferry, the port that the ferry arrives at in Great Britain should be entered on the departure declaration as the Office of Transit, this might be GB000124 Holyhead for example.</p>

<p>If a movement starts from Northern Ireland and moves directly to, and ends in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> without transiting Great Britain, or if it  moves directly to Ireland, there is no requirement to enter an Office of Transit.</p>
