<h2>Removal of legacy access to the Great Britain departures portal – New Computerised Transit System (<abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>In <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters/newsletter-5-may-2021">Newsletter 5 - May 2021</a>, we told you about the roll out of the updated departures service for the free-to-use <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> web portal and advised that submission of all Great Britain departure notifications should be made through the new service.</p>

<p>Following the successful launch of the new Office of Departures service, we are now decommissioning the Office of Departures legacy system. We have already completed similar work on the arrivals legacy system, of which we advised you in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters/newsletter-4-may-2021">Newsletter 4 - May 2021</a>.</p>

<p>From 8 July 2021, we will remove access to the legacy departures portal. All messages lodged after 8 July 2021 should be made through the new service. Any bookmarks or saved links you may have will no longer work.</p>

<p>We are doing this as the new service is the route for all departure declarations and we cannot continue to support the legacy service.</p>

<p>You will still be able to view messages for departures notifications that were already made using the legacy portal. This will be for up to 14 days from submission.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the new departures service as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You will still get the same support for issues you may have.</p>

<p>If you have any questions send an email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries.importexporttransit@hmrc.gov.uk">enquiries.importexporttransit@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>
