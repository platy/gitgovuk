<h2>Changes to the email and legacy Extensible Markup Language (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>) channels to access the New Computerised Transit System (<abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>) at the end of this month</h2>

<h3>Access to the legacy <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> channel for <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> will close on 28 February 2022</h3>

<p>We have changed our previously published intention to close the email channel on the same date. This will now take place on 31 May 2022.</p>

<p>In our earlier communications, found here; <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-common-transit-and-tir-newsletters">Community, Common Transit and TIR newsletters - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>, we explained the need to move to the new <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> (Application Programming Interface) channel to help manage expected post-Brexit volumes.</p>

<p>We are aware of challenges for software developers and traders in meeting this deadline for email and legacy <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> decommissioning.</p>

<p>Following feedback and a review of readiness with both software developers and traders, we have taken the decision to extend the date on which we close the email channel to help enable transition to the <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for users of email.</p>

<p>In extending the date to 31 May 2022, we have taken into account the challenges faced and the busy time period we have had at the end of 2021.</p>

<h3>This extension applies only to the email channel, the Legacy <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> Channel will still close on 28 February 2022</h3>

<p>This will be the case for all Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland movements.</p>

<p>To reiterate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>although we have delayed the date for closing the email channel, you still need to migrate to the new <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> as soon as possible</li>
  <li>you may be able to use email in the short term if you have the capability to do so, but you still need to update to the new <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
</li>
  <li>if you cannot move to the new <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for any reason, the free-to-use HMRC online portal is available and will give continuing access to the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr> — however, you should note that this may not be ideal for large volume users</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your software currently uses the legacy <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> or email channel to send messages, you must take action</h2>

<h3>Steps to take now if you are still using the legacy <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> channel to access the <abbr title="New Computerised Transit System">NCTS</abbr>
</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you’re using the legacy XML channel to access the NCTS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you need to check with your software provider now, what these changes mean for you and what action they need to take to be ready for you to use the new XML API Channel before 28 February 2022</li>
  <li>you should also check with your software provider to ensure you have all the relevant information you may need to log in — for example, your Government Gateway credentials</li>
  <li>you must ensure you have all necessary software upgrades and will be ready to use the new software package as soon as possible, as you will not be able to make any declarations using the legacy XML channel after 28 February 2022</li>
  <li>if you are not ready by 28 February 2022, the alternative to the new XML API channel is the free-to-use HMRC online portal</li>
  <li>if you have access to the email channel, this can continue to be used until 31 May 2022, but it will then also be closing</li>
</ul>
