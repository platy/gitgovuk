<h2>Updated the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) online web portal</h2>

<p>From 31 December 2020, we’ll begin releasing an updated service for the free-to-use NCTS web portal.</p>

<p>The new portal will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be easier to use</li>
  <li>provide a clearer interface with improved look and feel</li>
  <li>provide capacity to handle increased volumes of transit submissions</li>
  <li>meet government accessibility standards</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll deliver the changes as a phased release. In Transit Newsletter 2, we told you that (from 1 January 2021) access to the new Northern Ireland NCTS would be by email and the existing XML API channels only. Access to Northern Ireland NCTS by the web portal will be added later in 2021, as part of this rollout.</p>

<h2>Phased delivery roll out</h2>

<h3>Phase 1 – Great Britain arrivals</h3>

<p>From 31 December 2020, submission of all Great Britain arrivals and unloading notifications will be made through the new service. Messages relating to arrivals lodged after 31 December 2020 (for example, unloading permissions) will also be accessed through the new service.</p>

<p>You’ll still be able to access the legacy portal to view messages (submitted prior to 31 December 2020) that relate to arrival notifications.</p>

<h3>Phase 2 – Great Britain departures</h3>

<p>In Q1 2021, submission of all Great Britain departure declarations will be made through the new service. Messages relating to departures submitted after phase 2 delivery will also be accessed through the new service.</p>

<p>You’ll still be able to access the legacy portal to view messages (submitted prior to phase 2 delivery) that relate to to departure declarations.</p>

<h3>Phase 3 – Northern Ireland arrivals and departures</h3>

<p>Following the successful release of phase 2, support for submitting departures and arrivals at locations in Northern Ireland will be added. We’ll closely monitor site feedback throughout delivery, so we can provide the best user experience possible.</p>

<p>New or existing NCTS web portal users do not need to take any action. Upon logging in, users will be directed to the new portal declaration areas as they become available.</p>

<h2>National transit – Office of Transit inclusion on declaration</h2>

<p>National transit is a movement that remains in the same country (as designated within NCTS) from it’s release to the end of the movement. Whilst the Common Transit Convention does not make direct provision for national transit, the UK allows the use of national transit.</p>

<p>The technical rules of NCTS specify that, where either the Office of Departure or Office of Destination for a given transit movement are not located in an EU member state, an Office of transit must be included in the departure declaration.</p>

<p>This means that for national transit within Great Britain (movements that remain wholly within Great Britain’s mainland and crown dependencies), an Office of Transit must be included in the departure declaration. Declarants may duplicate the Office of Destination reference number in the Office of Transit data field.</p>

<p>If a trader is not able to use the destination reference number in the Office of Transit data field (for example, if the selected Office of Destination does not offer an Office of Transit) they can enter any other active <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit">Office of Transit within Great Britain</a>.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/945616/Transit_Manual_Supplement.pdf" class="govuk-link">Transit Manual Supplement</a> will be updated shortly with this information.</p>

<h2>Updates to Customs Offices used for transit</h2>

<p>In Transit Newsletter 3, we explained that NCTS operations in Northern Ireland will be denoted by the country code XI and that, from 1 January 2021, existing transit offices located there will change their reference number identifying prefix from GB to XI but retain their existing numerical value i.e. GB00142 becomes XI00142.</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021, the supervising office code for authorised departure and arrival locations that are in Northern Ireland will change from GB000081 “UK North Auth Consignor/nees” to XI000081 “NI Consignor/nees”.</p>

<p>Other Northern Ireland ports which accept traffic directly from Great Britain, may also offer Office of Transit functions. These ports will be added to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-offices-community-and-common-transit" class="govuk-link">Community and Common Transit UK offices list</a> as they are approved.</p>

<p>Offices of transit have already been approved at Larne XI005220 and Warrenpoint XI005 and will be added shortly. The list will also be updated with any changes to mainland GB offices.</p>
