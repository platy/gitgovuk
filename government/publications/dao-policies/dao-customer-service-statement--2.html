<h2>Customer Service Statement</h2>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>The vision of the Defence Awarding Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>) is to deliver a customer service that is dynamic and attuned to customer needs.  This will be achieved by working with customers and using <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>’s detailed knowledge of the awarding organisation sector, whilst providing a robust accreditation service that is compliant with the requirements of the Qualifications Regulators.  <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will be adaptable, courteous, and behave with integrity.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> provides an accreditation service where armed forces personnel (regular and reserve), <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr> civil servants can gain formal recognition of their achievements and obtain a qualification, which has been subjected to a rigorous quality assurance process; employers will have confidence that their employees have reached an agreed level of skills and knowledge.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> takes seriously all feedback from customers.  This is critical to help <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and Centres continually improve the services they provide.  Periodically, a customer satisfaction survey involving all approved Centres and a selection of Learners will be undertaken; however, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> welcomes feedback at any time.</p>
