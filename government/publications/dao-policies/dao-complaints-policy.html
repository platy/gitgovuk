<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>) is located at the Defence Academy of the UK in Shrivenham and was set up in 2014 to provide vocational qualifications to members of the armed forces (regular and reserve) and Ministry of Defence civil servants. The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>’s vision is to be recognised as the awarding organisation of choice for the Defence community.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> develops and provides nationally and internationally recognised qualifications from levels 2 to 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF). The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> approve centres to deliver its regulated qualifications through education and training programmes; and is responsible, reporting annually, to the Office of Qualifications and Examination Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> takes all complaints seriously. This policy and associated procedures are aimed at individuals regarding dissatisfaction with <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> actions, products, services and or the application of our policies by any stakeholders. This provides a formal process by which individuals can report complaints to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and provides <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> with a process to handle failures or potential failures identified by <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr> or other Awarding Organisations.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has separate policies and procedures for dealing with:</p>

<h3>Enquiries and appeals</h3>

<p>Enquiries - <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> Centres or Learners who have a valid claim can make an enquiry into the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> regarding assessment decisions affecting their Learners’ results and other decisions affecting Centres and/or Learners, including:</p>

<p>•	enquiries on assessment decisions</p>

<p>•	decisions regarding Reasonable Adjustments and Special Considerations (see separate policy)</p>

<p>•	decisions relating to any action to be taken against a Learner or a Centre following an investigation into malpractice or maladministration</p>

<p>Appeals - appeals are raised whenever a Centre or Learner does not agree with an assessment or other decision made by the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> which affects them.</p>

<h3>Malpractice and maladministration</h3>

<p>•	malpractice - actual or suspected negligence or misconduct in carrying out an activity or a practice</p>

<p>•	maladministration - a lack of care, judgement, or honesty in the management of processes or procedures</p>

<p>If after reasonable discussions with the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> the complainant remains dissatisfied with the outcome of the resolution, they can progress this through the appeals process. This is detailed within the Enquiry and Appeals Policy.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>Complaints are defined as any feedback provided by individuals or <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr> regarding an actual or potential failure not covered by the policies listed within the Scope above. Qualification users are defined as persons who have legitimate interest in the qualification or type of qualification made available by <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and may include:</p>

<p>•	learners and Learners’ representatives
•	assessment Centres
•	employers and employers’ representatives
•	further and higher education establishments
•	government departments and agencies
•	professional bodies</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this policy and its associated policies and procedures is to:</p>

<p>•	provide a formal process by which Qualification users can feedback any complaints to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr></p>

<p>•	provide a complaints policy and procedure detailing timescales involved that Qualification users clearly understand</p>

<p>Provide <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> with a formal process through which:</p>

<p>•	complaints are recorded</p>

<p>•	complaints are given serious consideration</p>

<p>•	mitigating action can be taken, which may include reviewing the approach to the development, delivery and award of qualifications following feedback from Qualifications users, other awarding organisations or <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr></p>

<p>Comply with the requirements of any complaints policy established or revised by <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>.
Where, in the case of a Learner, the complaints process leads to the discovery of a failure in the assessment process, the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will take all reasonable steps to:</p>

<p>•	identify any other Learner who has been affected by that failure</p>

<p>•	correct or, where it cannot be corrected, mitigate as far as possible the effect of the failure, and</p>

<p>•	ensure that the failure does not recur</p>

<p>When the <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr> notifies <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> of failures that have been discovered in the process of another Awarding Organisation, the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will review whether a similar failure could affect its own assessment process. Where failures have been identified by <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>, the same actions will be taken as if the failure had been identified through the complaints procedure or notified by <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Complaints procedure</h2>

<p>Complaints should be sent by email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries.dao@da.mod.uk">enquiries.dao@da.mod.uk</a> or by post to:</p>
