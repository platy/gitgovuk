<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation (DAO) is located at the Defence Academy, Shrivenham, and was set up in 2014 to provide vocational qualifications to members of the armed forces (regular and reserve) and to Ministry of Defence civil servants.  The DAO’s vision is to be recognised as the awarding organisation of choice for the defence community.</p>

<p>The DAO develops and provides nationally and internationally recognised qualifications from levels 2 to 7 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (<abbr title="Regulated Qualification Framework">RQF</abbr>).  The DAO approve centres to deliver its regulated qualifications through current education and training programmes.  The DAO is responsible, and reports annually, to the Office of Qualifications and Examination Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>).</p>

<p>DAO qualifications are developed from education and training programmes which are themselves aligned to the Defence Systems Approach to Training (<abbr title="Defence Systems Approach to Training">DSAT</abbr>).  In addition to being aligned to <abbr title="Defence Systems Approach to Training">DSAT</abbr>, DAO qualifications are benchmarked, where appropriate, to National Occupational Standards and standards determined by professional bodies.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Systems Approach to Training">DSAT</abbr> training is delivered within local, ie at training centres, and remote locations.  Remote delivery applies to programmes which are paper-based, distance learning packages, or programmes which are delivered electronically through e-learning platforms. DLE is Defence’s primary Virtual Learning Environment (<abbr title="Virtual Learning Environment">VLE</abbr>), so exploitation of this medium should be considered before looking at other technologies.  This policy relates to those programmes and qualifications which are delivered through e-learning platforms.</p>

<h2>Accreditation</h2>

<p>An accredited qualification is one which has been recognised by the Regulator, <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>, and one which meets specific criteria and quality standards. In its capacity as an awarding organisation, the DAO can review current and future education and training programmes regarding content and <abbr title="Defence Systems Approach to Training">DSAT</abbr> alignment, to determine where qualifications will be located within the <abbr title="Regulated Qualification Framework">RQF</abbr>, and subsequently, design qualifications which will act as the accreditation benchmark.  This process applies to education and training programmes which are delivered face-to-face or remotely.</p>

<h2>E-learning</h2>

<p>E-learning (also known as electronic learning), for the purpose of this policy, is defined as any and all learning which is delivered via a computer and/or other electronic device such as a tablet.  E-learning provides flexible and mobile learning to the defence community.  On the basis that access to online material is possible, learners can engage in their studies wherever they are in the world.  This helps to ensure learning is continuous and completed within those timescales agreed with line managers and employers.</p>

<p>Also, learners accessing knowledge through e-learning platforms are presented with the opportunity to study in their own time and pace.  This is a positive alternative to the constraints of traditional, classroom based, learning.   E-learning can be a key aspect of a blended approach to learning where there is an element of face-to-face engagement, or as a standalone option to the development of knowledge and skills underpinning professional competence.</p>

<h2>Policy statement</h2>

<p>This policy has been developed to provide the direction and support required by approved centres who wish to deliver accredited qualifications where some, or all, aspects of learning takes place through e-learning.  This policy will help to ensure that delivery and learning are set at, and maintained to, the highest of standards.  This policy will apply to delivery systems/platforms, security of content and learner details, learner support, assessment of learning and the professional development of tutors supporting e-learning.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the quality and structure of e-learning material.  This is the responsibility of an approved centre.  However, the DAO, through this policy, retain the right to ensure that e-learning resources are appropriate to the qualification it is aligned to.</p>

<p>The DAO has a singular aim for this policy; this is to:</p>

<p>Provide the direction and guidance which approved centres require thereby enabling effective and efficient e-learning to take place where learners are not disadvantaged through the implementation and use of this mode of study.</p>

<h2>The principles</h2>

<p>In support of this aim, the DAO has adopted 7 principles.  These principles form the framework which will be used to quality assure the standards of teaching and learning within programmes delivered in whole or in part, through e-learning.  This framework also establishes the responsibilities of those who provide the delivery systems/platforms through which e-learning resources are accessed.</p>

<p>The principles are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>principle 1: E-learning programmes must provide opportunities for flexible and independent learning</li>
  <li>principle 2: Learners should have access to e-learning material which is comparable to material delivered through face-to-face programmes</li>
  <li>principle 3: Delivery systems and/or platforms are to be maintained to such an extent that barriers to e-learning are minimal</li>
  <li>principle 4: Approved centres are encouraged to exploit innovative technologies to enhance the learner experience</li>
  <li>principle 5: Approved centres are required to develop e-learning tutors and resources to ensure learning is fit for purpose</li>
  <li>principle 6: E-learning providers are to meet the standards expected and required by all their stakeholders</li>
  <li>principle 7: The DAO will assure the quality and availability of e-learning opportunities and delivery systems/platforms which support the attainment of accredited qualifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The expectations of these principles is detailed further below.</p>

<h2>Associated polices, legislation and documents</h2>

<p>Approved centres delivering accredited qualifications are to use this policy, in association with other policies and documents, when designing e-learning programmes and resources for delivery through appropriate e-learning systems/platforms.  This policy does not displace the content of these policies and documents but compliments their requirements and expectations.</p>

<p>The policies, legislation and documents associated with this policy are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSP 440: Defence Manual of Security</li>
  <li>JSP 822: Defence Systems Approach to Training Direction and Guidance for Individual and Collective Training</li>
  <li>Defence Gateway Risk Management Accreditation document set for JSF Hosted Applications</li>
  <li>Defence Learning Environment Privacy Impact Assessment</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr> General Conditions of Recognition</li>
  <li>Equality Act</li>
  <li>Data Protection Act</li>
  <li>General Data Protection Regulation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The 7 principles</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, the 7 principles form the framework which will be used to quality assure the standards of teaching and learning within programmes delivered in whole or in part, through e-learning.  The expectations for each principle are detailed below.</p>

<h3>Principle 1</h3>

<p>E-learning programmes must provide equal opportunities for flexible and independent learning.</p>

<p>The approved centre is responsible for ensuring that the quality of the learning experience, through resources and tutoring, is adequate so that learners can achieve the learning outcomes of a qualification and its component units.</p>

<p>Approved centres must ensure that all learners who engage with electronic based resources are able to access these resources at a time to suit their individual circumstances.</p>

<p>When designing e-learning material and resources, centres must ensure they consider appropriate equality and diversity legislation and comply with this accordingly.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to provide a single point of contact for learners on an e-learning programme.  This point of contact will provide individual and cohort support to enhance the learning experience.</p>

<p>Approved centres and the providers of delivery systems/platforms are to adapt content and systems/platforms for those learners who may have a specific learning difficulty (SpLD).</p>

<p>Approved centres must develop assessments which are appropriate to an e-learning environment.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to liaise with the providers of delivery systems/platforms to ensure that online assessment malpractice is minimised.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure that responsible officers (military or civilian) authenticate all online assessments.</p>

<h3>Principle 2</h3>

<p>Learners should have access to e-learning material which is comparable to material delivered through face-to-face programmes.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure that learning material and resources are adapted and presented in such a way that the structure and content do not detract from the expectations of learners who study via an e-learning route.</p>

<p>Where relationships exist within an e-learning programme with external online resources, approved centres are to ensure that the quality and content of these third-party providers meet the standards required to enable learners to achieve the learning outcomes of a qualification and its component units.</p>

<p>Approved centres are responsible for ensuring that e-learning material, resources and assessment are current and appropriate to the qualification and/or unit to which they apply.</p>

<h3>Principle 3</h3>

<p>Delivery systems and/or platforms are to be maintained to such an extent that barriers to e-learning are minimal.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to maintain a close working relationship with the provider of any delivery systems/platforms so they can be in a position to respond to changes to a system/platform which may subsequently present a barrier to learning.</p>

<p>In addition to the quality and content of resources accessed through third party providers (see 2.2 above), approved centres are to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that these resources are accessible to learners as and when required.</p>

<p>Approved centres (or a nominated third party) are to inform users of a delivery system/platform of when that system/platform will not be accessible by learners.</p>

<h3>Principle 4</h3>

<p>Approved centres are encouraged to exploit innovative technologies to enhance the learner experience.</p>

<p>To enable the technology on which e-learning is based to maintain currency and therefore continue to facility learning which meets the expectations of learners and employers. Approved centres are to explore innovative and contemporary technologies which could be used to enhance the learning experience. The DLE is Defence’s primary <abbr title="Virtual Learning Environment">VLE</abbr>, so exploitation of that should be considered before looking at other technologies.</p>

<p>Approved centres are encouraged to collaborate with their delivery system/platform provider(s) to explore enhancements to existing systems/platforms.</p>

<p>Approved centres are encouraged to develop innovative online assessments which will act as a measure of learning and achievement.</p>

<h3>Principle 5</h3>

<p>Approved centres are required to develop e-learning tutors and resources to ensure learning is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>It is necessary and required that all tutors who are responsible for the development of online resources and/or engaged in an online tutoring role engage in appropriate continued professional development.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure that any new employee or contractor employed as an online resource developer and/or online tutor have the necessary experience, knowledge and skills to fully engage in either role.</p>

<h3>Principle 6</h3>

<p>E-learning providers are to meet the standards expected and required by all their stakeholders.</p>

<p>Approved centres must make available, on request, access to any e-learning material and resources which appropriate stakeholders may wish to view.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to respond positively to requests by appropriate stakeholders to suggested changes in content and/or design which may enhance the learner experience.</p>

<p>E-learning is to provide the independent learner with an effective and engaging experience such that all learners are confident that learning will take place and learning outcomes of the relevant accredited qualification can be achieved.</p>

<p>Approved centres and providers of delivery systems/platforms are to respond to complaint in a positive and timely manner.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to provide a code of conduct to its learners with regard to the behaviours and expectations placed on those studying via e-learning routes.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure its code of conduct incorporates any appropriate code of conduct implemented by the provider of a delivery system/platform.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure that personal data and information stored within a delivery system/platform is secure.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to liaise with the provider of a delivery system/platform to ensure the security of content which will subsequently prevent any breach of copywrite and/or intellectual property right.</p>

<p>Approved centres are to ensure that access to material hosted on e-learning systems/platforms is restricted to help maintain the privacy of leaners.  Learners are to be provided with a unique enrolment key/password to their own online learning ‘space’.</p>

<h3>Principle 7</h3>

<p>The DAO will assure the quality and availability of e-learning opportunities and delivery systems/platforms which support the attainment of accredited qualifications.</p>

<p>The DAO are responsible to <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr> for ensuring that no aspect of a qualification and how it is delivered will disadvantage a group of learners who share a similar characteristic.</p>

<p>The DAO hold the right to access any e-learning material and resources to ensure suitability of content.</p>

<p>The DAO hold the right to access any and all delivery systems/platforms to ensure technological barriers to learning do not exist.</p>

<p>Should, through monitoring and assessment, the DAO identify aspects of e-learning resources, material and/or technology which could prevent a barrier to learning then they will require the approved centre and/or system/platform provider to conduct an appropriate review.</p>

<h2>Review of the policy</h2>

<p>The policy will be reviewed annually and it will be revised as necessary in response to customer feedback, changes in legislation and guidance from <abbr title="Office of Qualification and Examination Regulations">Ofqual</abbr>.</p>
