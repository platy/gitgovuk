<h2>Malpractice Policy</h2>

<p>Recognising Quality and Competence: supporting defence with accreditation and specialist bespoke qualification opportunities.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>) is held to account by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulatio">Ofqual</abbr>) against the ‘General Conditions of Recognition’ in order to maintain the integrity of the qualifications and the credibility of the organisations involved in development, delivery and award of those qualifications. An awarding organisation must have and use current, relevant written policy and procedures for the investigation of suspected or alleged malpractice and/or maladministration, as per Condition A8. What follows are those procedures. <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> must ensure that investigations are carried out rigorously and effectively by suitably competent people who have no personal interest in the outcome of the investigation.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> aligns with the definition of malpractice by the Joint Council of Qualifications (<abbr title="Joint Council of Qualifications">JCQ</abbr>). Malpractice, which included maladministration and non-compliance with the Regulations, means any act, default or practice which is a breach of the Regulations which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>compromises, attempts to compromise or may compromise the process of assessment, the integrity of any qualification or the validity of a result or certificate; and/or,</li>
  <li>damage the authority, reputation or credibility of any awarding body or centre or any officer, employee or agent of any awarding body or centre.</li>
</ul>

<p>Malpractice is negligence or misconduct in carrying out a practice, which deliberately breaches regulations, or could compromise the integrity of the assessment process, the qualification, the validity of certificates, or the reputation of the Centre, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and <abbr title="Ministry of Defence">MOD</abbr>. Maladministration can be defined as lack of care, judgment or honesty in the management of some activity. <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will use the term malpractice for both malpractice and maladministration, in alignment with <abbr title="Joint Council of Qualifications">JCQ</abbr> advice, with the difference in degree of offence reflected to the level sanction applied. Some examples of malpractice are as follows:</p>

<h3>Awareness and establishing culture</h3>

<p>Heads of centre should build and maintain an ethical culture in which malpractice by learners (trainees or students) and staff does not take place, hence, staff involved in the management, assessment and quality assurance of qualifications and learners undertaking <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> accredited qualifications need to be familiar with these procedures. Such a culture of honesty and openness should enable staff and learners to report matters of concern. Any aspect of the procedures can be discussed with the External Quality Assurers and <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> when they visit or by contacting the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> Compliance Team.</p>

<h3>Guidance on General Condition of Recognition A8</h3>

<p>Examples of ‘positive indicators’ that would suggest an awarding organisation is likely to comply are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has ways of working that reduce the risk of incidents of malpractice occurring</li>
  <li>makes sure that individuals involved in the development, delivery and award of its qualifications understand and routinely follow these ways of working</li>
  <li>takes all reasonable steps to ensure that current (and former) staff and third parties do not provide information about its qualifications which is inaccurate or misleading</li>
  <li>follows policies, practices and/or procedures that reduce the risk of malpractice, covering, among other things:</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
1. plagiarism, collusion, tampering, breach of confidentiality of assessment materials
<br>
2.  incidents that occur outside of England (if it operates elsewhere)
<br></p>

<ul>
  <li>knows what to do if evidence of malpractice comes to light, whether in the organisation itself or within a third party involved with the design, delivery or award of a qualification</li>
  <li>acts quickly when it has evidence of malpractice</li>
  <li>investigates promptly any allegations for which there are reasonable grounds that current (or former) staff or third parties have provided inaccurate or misleading information to Centres or Instructors/Assessors about its qualifications and, if the awarding organisation establishes that Instructors/Assessors have been misinformed, takes reasonable steps to correct any misunderstandings with the Centres or Instructors/Assessors that are affected</li>
  <li>captures, logs and addresses all suspicions and evidence of malpractice</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> uses and regularly reviews this policy and approach that sets out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who investigates concerns about malpractice</li>
  <li>how an investigation is undertaken</li>
  <li>how whistleblowers will be treated, and in such a way that individuals will not be prejudiced</li>
  <li>when and how interested parties will be notified lawfully</li>
  <li>how any interviews should be conducted</li>
  <li>how facts will be gathered, and evidence found, collated and stored</li>
  <li>how evidence will be verified</li>
  <li>how confidentiality of investigation materials is assured</li>
  <li>how the records of its investigations will be presented, and their accuracy assured</li>
  <li>how and when any visits to Centres will be announced and undertaken</li>
  <li>which principles will be followed when it undertakes an investigation with other bodies</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determine clear terms of reference for the investigations that are undertaken</li>
  <li>maintain a log of all allegations, including those that were not investigated, that it can cross-reference if new information is provided</li>
  <li>notify the Regulator, and/or other awarding organisations, depending on the outcome of the investigation</li>
</ul>

<p>Where <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> finds that an Instructor/Assessor has disclosed confidential assessment information, it will ensure that, where appropriate, the Teaching Regulation Agency (<abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr>), or other professional regulator to which that person is subject, and/or line management (chain of command) is notified, where appropriate. In considering whether or not such a referral is appropriate, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> considers whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Instructor/Assessor in question is subject to professional regulation by the <abbr title="Teaching Regulation Agency">TRA</abbr> or other teaching regulator; and</li>
  <li>the malpractice identified is serious based on the facts of the case and the seriousness of the sanction imposed by the awarding organisation</li>
  <li>to raise an A8.7 notification to all awarding organisations</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> takes into account any guidance issued by the regulator. In general, a referral will be made where there was a deliberate or persistent disclosure in contravention of the requirements for the conduct of the assessment, or in breach of confidentiality of confidential assessment information, particularly where the action had, or was intended to have, a significant impact on the outcome of the assessment for at least one Learner.</p>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>When <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> or a Centre are notified of an allegation or have suspicions of malpractice, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> are responsible for establishing the facts to judge whether or not the allegation can be proven. If sufficient evidence can be gathered, then an investigation is to be initiated immediately taking the appropriate action. <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will work with the relevant people (including Centre staff and external parties) and define each person’s responsibilities at that time.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify the Head of Centre when either <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> or an external party identifies an allegation or suspicion of malpractice. If the allegation or suspicion implicates the Head of Centre, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will notify another suitable person within the chain of command</li>
  <li>support the Centre providing them with direction on how to undertake the investigation of the incident, preventing further malpractice being committed</li>
  <li>consider the need to immediately suspend registration and certification of the relevant qualification(s), as necessary</li>
  <li>use its staff and/or external contractors who are not connected to the Centre or its staff or learners to undertake a fair and unbiased investigation</li>
  <li>ensure that it takes all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the impact and effects of the incident of alleged or actual malpractice</li>
  <li>communicate appropriately with third parties who made the allegation or raised the suspicion.</li>
  <li>handle information in accordance with the Government Security Classifications, Data Protection Act and public record keeping rules</li>
</ul>

<p>The respective <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> centre will immediately perform an investigation and <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will undertake further investigation if required, ensuring procedure at Annex A is adhered to.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will report cases of malpractice to the qualification Regulator, as per para 9 and, whenever it finds evidence that results, or certificates may be invalid. Where it is proven that an incident of malpractice has occurred, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will promptly take all reasonable steps to prevent the malpractice recurring and take appropriate action against those responsible proportionate to the seriousness of the incident, or seek the co-operation of line management (the ‘chain-of-command’) in taking action.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has cause to believe that an occurrence of malpractice or any connected occurrence may affect a Centre or another Awarding Organisation it will inform those Organisations, reporting all allegations to <abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulatio">Ofqual</abbr> along with the final outcome. If there is evidence that a criminal act may have been committed <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will cease any further investigation and report it to the relevant Authority.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will determine through its finding if the Centre attracts a Sanction being awarded and the severity of sanction will depend on the risk it may have on Learners and the Centre. Details of the level of sanction awarded and its severity is listed in the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> Sanction Policy.</p>

<h3>Procedure for reporting malpractice</h3>

<h4>Centre’s responsibilities</h4>

<p>The Centre should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All incidents of suspected or alleged malpractice should be reported to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> immediately by emailing <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> Compliance Manager:</li>
</ul>

<p>Emails should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Centre name</li>
  <li>name(s) of those involved in the alleged or suspected malpractice and, if appropriate, their job role (Learner, Facilitator, Assessor, Administrator)</li>
  <li>the qualification or programme of activity</li>
  <li>date or time period the suspected malpractice occurred</li>
  <li>the nature of the suspicion or allegation</li>
  <li>details of immediate corrective or mitigation actions</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>inform the member of staff or learner who has been suspected of malpractice that an investigation will be conducted, and they have the right to reply or appeal against any sanction imposed upon them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>carry out an investigation (similar to a unit investigation) to establish the facts using people who are not involved with the alleged or suspected malpractice and report to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> within <strong>7 days</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence on or attached to the alleged or suspected malpractice reporting form (this form is available on the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> website)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>implement agreed actions as a result of the investigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inform centre staff and learners affected by the implications of the actions and sanctions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take appropriate action to prevent the malpractice recurring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>handle information in accordance with the Government Security Classification, Data Protection Act and Public Records Act</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will inform both their and the Centre’s line management (chain-of-command) about lack of co-operation. This may result in the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> permanently or temporarily withdrawing the Centre approval status or withdrawing learners from the qualification. During the investigation the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has the right to suspend the approval for the qualification/award in question and/or suspend the centre approval; withhold results of assessments for the individual learner or all learners who are undertaking the qualification or withhold claims for candidate certification for the individual learner or all learners who are undertaking the qualification.</p>

<h3>Ascertaining cases of alleged or actual malpractice</h3>

<p>Any person can report concerns they think could constitute malpractice. They could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> staff who identify it through our own working relationship with a Centre</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>’s External Quality Assurers who identify it via their Centre visits</li>
  <li>Centre staff</li>
  <li>learners</li>
  <li>Internal Quality Assurers</li>
  <li>external Agencies such as <abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulatio">Ofqual</abbr>, other Awarding Organisations and the Police</li>
  <li>members of the general public</li>
  <li>informants (anonymous or otherwise)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of a report coming from a whistleblowing accusation, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will ask the individual permission if they can identify them during the investigation. If the whistle-blower does not wish to be identified <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will honour their decision and not reveal their identity. In the event of an anonymous allegation of malpractice that does not reveal sufficient details required to investigate, the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will record the allegation and close the case.</p>

<h3>Investigating alleged malpractice</h3>

<p>Approved Centres are required to have a malpractice procedure. If suspected malpractice is reported to a Centre, they are to immediately start an investigation. Before submitting a report to 
<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure staff carrying out the investigation are independent of the staff, learners or function being investigated</li>
  <li>inform those who are suspected of malpractice; they are entitled to know the necessary details of the case and possible outcomes</li>
  <li>submit the report including findings of the investigation to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> with <strong>7 days</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> personnel will be assigned to investigate the incident. Interviews if required will be carried out face to face unless authorised by the Responsible Officer to be conducted remotely (for example, by telephone). Once complete they will present the facts of their investigation to the Responsible Officer who will make a decision. The outcome could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no further action if the allegation cannot be proven</li>
  <li>an agreed action plan between the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and Centre for the Centre to carry out</li>
  <li>a sanction or sanctions</li>
  <li>a criminal investigation.</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will fully co-operate with <abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulatio">Ofqual</abbr>, informing them at the earliest opportunity, where necessary, and agreeing any appropriate remedial action. Where <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has any cause to believe that an occurrence of malpractice, or any connected occurrence, may affect a Centre or another Awarding Organisation undertaking any part of the delivery of a qualification, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will inform that Centre or Awarding Organisation.</p>

<h3>Centre staff sanctions</h3>

<p>If malpractice is proven at staff level in a Centre <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will impose one of the following sanctions on the staff member through the Centre, in addition to para 8. They may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reported to their chain-of-command for administrative or disciplinary action</li>
  <li>re-trained before they can undertake any further Centre activity</li>
  <li>given special conditions or restrictions in any further Centre activity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learner sanctions</h3>

<p>If the investigation confirms that learner malpractice has taken place, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> will direct the Centre to do one or more of the following with the learner(s). The learner may (this list is not exhaustive):</p>

<ul>
  <li>be sent back to their place of work (‘RTU’)</li>
  <li>be reported to their line management (chain-of-command) for administrative or disciplinary action</li>
  <li>receive a written warning, agreed between <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and the Centre</li>
  <li>have internal assessment marks disallowed in part or in full</li>
  <li>be re-assessed and internally or externally moderated and checked</li>
  <li>have external assessment marks disallowed in part or in full</li>
  <li>be re-entered for the external assessment</li>
  <li>not be issued a certificate</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> expects the Centre to notify the Learners(s) of the sanction by providing them with a copy of the written notification from <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>. In cases where malpractice cannot be proven then no further action will be taken, but the investigation will be recorded in its log.</p>

<h3>Appeals</h3>

<p>Appeals, against a decision on malpractice and the sanctions imposed, can be made through the Enquiries and Appeals Policy which is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-awarding-organisation"><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> website</a>.</p>

<p>Centres and learners have the right to appeal against any decision that the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has made. If a learner wishes to appeal against a Centre decision, then the Centre must advise the learner of their appeals process. If the learner is dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeal then they can appeal to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> following its appeals process, published on the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> website.</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>This procedure will be reviewed annually and revised when necessary.</p>
