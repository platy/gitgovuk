<h2>Sanctions Policy</h2>

<p>Recognising Quality and Competence: supporting defence with accreditation and specialist bespoke qualification opportunities.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>) provides an accreditation service by which individuals can gain formal recognition of their achievements.  By gaining a qualification through a rigorous quality assurance process, employers will have confidence that their employees have reached an agreed level of skills and knowledge.  This involves the development, delivery and awarding of qualifications iaw the General Conditions of Recognition issued by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual).  This included setting assessments and quality assuring the assessment process to ensure that assessments are fair, valid and carried out in line with the defined processes.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>This policy covers eventualities where Approved Centres fail to meet the Centre Approval Criteria, and/or, when the Centre’s ability to assess and quality assure qualifications to the requirements of <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> is compromised.   Hence, sanctions will be applied when an Approved Centre fails to continue to meet the Centre Approval Criteria and/or the Centre’s ability to assess qualifications is compromised.  For example, where a centre fails to comply with the requirements for maintaining auditable records and cannot substantiate claims made on behalf of Learners.</p>

<p>Sanctions are usually applied or recommended by External Quality Assurer’s (EQA) to protect the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interests of the Learners</li>
  <li>integrity of the qualifications and/or the quality assurance process</li>
  <li>public confidence in qualifications</li>
</ul>

<p>The type and level of sanctions that <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> may impose on its Centre will be dependent on numerous factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the Centre has undertaken to contain adverse effect, correct it and prevent reoccurrence</li>
  <li>robustness of Centre Policies and processes</li>
  <li>centre historical maintenance of compliance</li>
  <li>centre willingness to co-operate with <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> and to resolve situation</li>
</ul>
