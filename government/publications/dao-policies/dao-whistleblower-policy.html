<h3>
<span class="number">0.1 </span>Scope</h3>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation (<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>) provides an accreditation service by which individuals can gain formal recognition of their achievements. By gaining a qualification through a rigorous quality assurance process, employers will have confidence that their employees have reached an agreed level of skills and knowledge.</p>

<p>This involves the development, delivery and awarding of qualifications saw the General Conditions of Recognition issued by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (<abbr title="Office of Qualifications and Examination Regulation">Ofqual</abbr>). This included setting assessments and quality assuring the assessment process to ensure that assessments are fair, valid and carried out in line with the defined processes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> is committed to the highest possible standards of openness, honesty and integrity for the benefit of its approved centres, learners and the public at large. Hence, the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> treats any aspects of wrongdoing that underpins the validity of an assessment in support of a <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> qualification very seriously. It is expected that <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> staff, or representatives, will work and uphold <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> procedures and policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.2 </span>Purpose</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> encourages learners/centres, others, to raise any concerns should they feel they have not been addressed adequately by a <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> or the centre policy. In the event that wrongdoing is identified, in connection with a <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> procedure and policy, in support of awarding regulated qualifications, which cannot be addressed by any other <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> policy, then the individual should follow this whistleblower policy.</p>

<p>This policy covers <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>’s commitment to protect learners, centres and the validity of the qualifications it awards and offer guidance on what to do. A whistleblower may to report on a variety of areas involving a <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> centre in relation to safety, safeguarding, bullying, inclusion, fraud, criminal behaviour, etc and hence, is not limited to malpractice in assessment which is addressed below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.3 </span>Public interest disclosure act</h3>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> has a positive commitment and open approach to whistleblowing in line with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (<abbr title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">PIDA</abbr>) and Joint Council for Qualifications (<abbr title="Joint Council for Qualifications">JCQ</abbr>) advice.</p>

<p><abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> supports <abbr title="Joint Council for Qualifications">JCQ</abbr> guidance as follows:</p>

<p>Guidance in relation to suspected malpractice in examinations and assessments</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Joint Council for Qualifications">JCQ</abbr> guidance is principally for centre staff who may witness malpractice in examinations and assessments, but may be unsure about what action to take; it can be utilised by learners or others who have a concern.</p>

<p>The Public Interest Disclosure Act (<abbr title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">PIDA</abbr>) gives legal protection to employees from being dismissed or penalised by their employers as a result of publicly disclosing (“blowing the whistle on”) certain serious concerns.</p>

<p>It is probable that your organisation has a whistleblowing policy. If it does not, you will still be protected under the <abbr title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">PIDA</abbr>. This allows you the opportunity to bring to your Senior Management Team’s attention possible corruption or non-conformance with legal obligations for example, but also when you suspect malpractice is taking place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.4 </span>What should you do if you see malpractice taking place in examinations or assessments?</h3>

<p>If you believe that your management team will take action to remedy the situation then informing your line manager may be the best solution. However, if you believe that your Senior Management Team is involved, or you believe that you may be victimised by raising the issues with them, then you may wish to talk to the relevant awarding body.</p>

<p>You will still be protected by the <abbr title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">PIDA</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you reasonably believe that by making the disclosure to your employer you will be victimised</li>
  <li>you reasonably believe that by making the disclosure to your employer there is likely to be a cover-up</li>
  <li>the matter has previously been raised internally or with the sector regulator.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.5 </span>Who do you talk to and what happens if you contact an awarding body?</h3>

<p>Each awarding body has staff who deal with malpractice. You can talk to them in confidence and explain your concerns.</p>

<p>The awarding body will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respect your rights under the <abbr title="Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998">PIDA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>understand the difficult position that you are in</li>
  <li>have experience of similar situations</li>
  <li>explain the importance of supporting evidence and the sort of evidence that might help in your particular case.</li>
</ul>

<p>The awarding body will make every effort to protect your identity, if that is what you wish, unless legally obliged to release it. This may be in the course of a police investigation, for example. Please be aware that it will not be possible for the awarding body to provide you with a report on the findings or outcome of any investigation that may ensue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.6 </span>What to do</h3>

<p>An individual, who feels that they need to report an issue related to the provision of service provided by <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>, should consider the following guidelines to protect themselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consider the situation before they act</li>
  <li>tell no one of their intention to report as a whistleblower; if they wish to discuss with someone then ensure they can be trusted, alternatively, contact the <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> for guidance</li>
  <li>make telephone calls and emails, to report, from a secure place, for example from the home, not from the workplace/centre</li>
  <li>obtain documentary evidence where possible; photocopy any documents which may be relevant, these maybe useful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">0.7 </span>
<abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> protection of your identity</h3>

<p>The identity of whistleblowers and informants will not normally be disclosed without their permission. There are some circumstances where <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> may have to disclose your identity such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the police, fraud prevention agencies or other law enforcement agencies (to investigate or prevent crime, including fraud)</li>
  <li>the courts (in connection with court proceedings)</li>
  <li>another person to whom we are required by law to disclose your identity.</li>
</ul>

<p>A whistleblower should be aware that he/she may be identifiable by others due to the nature or circumstances of the disclosure. However, anonymous allegations, may also be reported to <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr>; however, <abbr title="Defence Awarding Organisation">DAO</abbr> can only act on the allegation if it has sufficient details.</p>
