<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Adult social care (<abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr>) providers are critical partners in the health and care system. Over 1.5 million people work in <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> in England<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, most of whom are employed by small and medium-sized independent providers including voluntary and community providers.</p>

<p>When we refer to <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers in this document, we mean the organisations who provide <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> services, regardless of whether they are from the independent, public, or voluntary, community and social enterprise (<abbr title="Voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr>) sector. The integrated care strategy guidance contains further expectations for integrated care partnerships (<abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>) on engaging people and organisations, including <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers.</p>

<p>The Health and Care Act 2022 builds on the work of existing non-statutory integrated care systems (<abbr title="integrated care systems">ICSs</abbr>) by establishing NHS bodies known as integrated care boards (<abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr>) and requiring the creation of <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> in each of the 42 <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> areas across England.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> will take on the functions previously carried out by clinical commissioning groups and will be responsible for driving integration with and within the NHS. The <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will provide an essential forum for health and <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> partners to agree how the health and care needs of its population should be addressed through the work of the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>, local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and their system partners. This document emphasises the importance of <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers as essential partners and the expectation that they will be supported to be fully engaged in the work of the partnership.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> have a statutory duty to create an integrated care strategy to address the assessed needs, such as health and care needs of the population within the <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>’s area, including determinants of health and wellbeing such as employment, environment, and housing.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> will be required by law to have regard to the integrated care strategy when exercising any of their functions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. NHS England (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>) must have regard to the integrated care strategy when ‘exercising any functions in arranging for the provision of health services in relation to the area of a responsible LA’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.’ Through being involved in the work of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> and the development of the integrated care strategy, <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers will be able to shape, influence and support the strategic direction of the <abbr title="Integrated care system">ICS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>These ways of working, developed by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), Local Government Association (<abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr>) and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>, in partnership with the Care Provider Alliance, set out a series of advisory principles for <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers to guide their work together.</p>

<p>They are intended as co-created advice, offering a firm basis on which to establish mutually supportive ways of working between <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr>.</p>

<p>These principles will also be a benefit in guiding any partnership arrangements, including <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and health and wellbeing boards (<abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>), and will help to ensure <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers are involved as essential partners, alongside commissioners, people with lived experiences of care or unpaid carers among others, in the work of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> as they all have valuable perspectives to contribute to service planning across England.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<p>The principles at the centre of this guidance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>partnership - <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers are critical partners in planning, delivering, and improving care and outcomes</li>
  <li>inclusion - <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and providers should collectively support the whole <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> voice to be heard</li>
  <li>subsidiarity - <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should promote place-based integration, building on the partnership arrangements that already exist and foster new working relationships</li>
  <li>knowledge sharing - <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should facilitate sharing of knowledge across places and systems to improve health and care services</li>
</ul>

<p>These principles, alongside other guidance including <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and health and wellbeing boards (<abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr>), and will help to ensure <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers are involved in service planning in <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> across England.</p>

<p>To achieve this, <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will support <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and providers through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping providers and provider organisations to understand and participate in the development and functioning of the <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and wider partnerships</li>
  <li>make national connections between <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and provider organisations to develop effective links</li>
  <li>develop a wider support offer to help build capability in <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers to engage</li>
  <li>share case studies and examples of how engagement between <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers and others are working</li>
  <li>providing implementation support to support work with care providers to drive uptake of digital technologies, including central regional engagement and local hands-on support in each <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Engagement principles</h2>

<h3>All systems should work together collaboratively through <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to achieve better health and wellbeing outcomes for their populations</h3>

<p>For systems to improve health and wellbeing outcomes, <abbr title="integrated care boards">ICBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will need to bring together a broad variety of health and care partners to plan, deliver and improve joined-up services, including not just local authorities, NHS bodies and <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers but also other partners in the health and care system. For <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr>, this may also include charities and <abbr title="Voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> organisations, people delivering care both paid and unpaid, and people drawing on care and support.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should strive to develop a culture of trust, openness, respect, and honesty, with all partners working through challenges. Working in partnership will build shared purpose and common aspiration across the entire system, leading to better health and care for all.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers are critical partners in planning, delivering, and improving health and wellbeing outcomes</h3>

<p><abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers are not just delivery partners. They should be fully engaged in the work of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> as strategic partners. This includes ensuring their perspectives and insights are fully represented in each <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> to achieve joined-up, person-centred and preventative care together.</p>

<p><abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers can be deeply rooted in their local communities. They bring hugely valuable expertise in meeting the current and future needs of their wider communities, as well as deep insight and understanding of the people and communities they serve.</p>

<p>Their knowledge and expertise will support the <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tackle the deep-rooted health inequalities</li>
  <li>improve the health and wellbeing of people who live and work in their area</li>
  <li>drive greater personalisation of services</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should also be clear on how the work of the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> is relevant to <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers, their employees, and the people that they support care for through clear, and accessible engagement and communications.</p>

<p>They will also need to be aware of the capacity, and capability of providers to be involved at system-level, and consider making arrangements that will facilitate their involvement, including, where appropriate, providing resources and training to build capability and capacity.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and providers should collectively support the whole <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> voice to be heard in each <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>
</h3>

<p><abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers provide care and support for a wide range of people through a varied range of services. This includes care homes, home care, supported living, community-based, and information and advice. Many of them will be small or micro providers. Families, unpaid carers, and community networks are also a critical part of the <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> infrastructure and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should also involve them in their work.</p>

<p>Every organisation or individual that contributes to the care and support of people needing assistance from <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> will have their own views and needs when planning care services, and some providers will be better able to represent themselves in system level decision-making than others.</p>

<p>We expect that <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should take an open approach to strategy development and the involvement of partners and communities. Therefore, <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should reflect and respond to the <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> provider voice when producing integrated care strategies. They should also seek to ensure that the integrated care strategy is well communicated, so that all <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers in a system are aware of how the plans might affect them.</p>

<p><abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers should be encouraged, supported, and where appropriate, resourced to build sustainable networks and relationships. This could be through care associations, local authority provider forums or other local, regional or national networks. These networks should provide the diversity and breadth of provider perspectives, and report on how those perspectives are used and acted upon. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> may decide that, according to their local circumstances, this is most effectively done through setting up an <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> provider forum. The <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> should create an effective space or forum through which to engage with <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers.</p>

<p>Local authorities, as part of their market shaping duties, should ensure that all <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers in their area, as well as those that they engage and commission are aware of the opportunities to participate in these forums. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should develop relationships, and build networks with local care associations, the <abbr title="Voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> alliance and other provider organisations including regional and national provider networks to strengthen their engagement. We would expect the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> to support, encourage and where appropriate, resource to support, the establishment and sustainability of these networks.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> and <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers should build on the existing place-based partnership arrangements and locally foster new working relationships</h3>

<p>We expect that <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will support integrated approaches and subsidiarity. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should understand their geography, needs, challenges and existing forums. As most service integration happens at place-level, <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should champion collaborative working relationships between <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers, and their members at place-level, as well as support coalitions with community partners, in addition to system-level working.</p>

<p>Each system will have different relationships between the partners in their area, with some systems having more mature and joined-up relationships than others. <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers, NHS partners, local authorities and other system partners should all build on the place-based working relationships that already exist in their area and facilitate more partnership working wherever possible.</p>

<p>For some providers, it might be more appropriate for them to be primarily engaged with neighbourhood organisations, such as primary care networks or place-based partnerships, rather than the <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> are key drivers of place-based integration and play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of integrated care strategies. <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers from the independent, <abbr title="Voluntary, community and social enterprise">VCSE</abbr> and public sectors, should be represented through provider forums.</p>

<p>Care Associations and other provider organisations should be supported, encouraged and where appropriate, resourced to work closely with their local <abbr title="health and wellbeing board">HWB</abbr>, and any place based <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> sub-committees to improve service delivery at place level. The involvement of directors of adult social services in <abbr title="health and wellbeing boards">HWBs</abbr> and <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> is not an adequate proxy for <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> provider voice.</p>

<h3>Share good practice across places and systems to improve health and care services</h3>

<p>We expect that <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will choose to use local insights and data in their strategy development, alongside the joint strategic needs’ assessments. <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers, NHS, local authorities, and other partner organisations can also use these insights and data to improve their services through learning from each other’s specialist expertise and knowledge across the system. <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> should communicate to <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers about how this data and insight is used and acted on.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="integrated care partnership">ICP</abbr> and its system partners should encourage each other to innovate, developing better ways of working, as well as to share knowledge, findings, and best practice at both place and system-level. They may wish to think about how they can support this through structures, such as dedicated communities of practice or through practical steps, such as collaborative data sharing agreements.</p>

<p><abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> will also have to publish their integrated care strategy so <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers should be able to see where this insight and data has influenced the integrated care strategy. Contributions should be fed back to all contributors wherever possible.</p>

<p>To help providers achieve this, <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> have announced an investment of at least £150m to drive digitisation in the sector to improve the quality, safety, and personalisation of care. This will include ensuring at least 80% of social care providers have adopted digital social care records by March 2024. By March 2025, health and social care staff will have appropriate access to a complete view of a person’s lifelong health and social care record, to which they can contribute.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> and <abbr title="Local Government Association">LGA</abbr> recognise that <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers and workforce continue to give excellent and compassionate care to the people they support people who draw on care and support. We expect <abbr title="integrated care partnerships">ICPs</abbr> to use data and insight to positively impact workforce planning, this should ensure that the skills and expertise of <abbr title="Adult social care">ASC</abbr> providers and employees are used to support people drawing on care to live a good life and achieve their ambitions.</p>
