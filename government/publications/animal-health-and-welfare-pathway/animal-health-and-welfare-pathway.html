<p>The Animal Health and Welfare Pathway (the Pathway) is to launch in 2022.</p>

<p>The Pathway will push forward and support the gradual and continual improvement in farm animal health and welfare. The Pathway is a partnership, the government will work together on each step with farmers, vets, the wider industry and the supply chain.</p>

<p>The Pathway is a critical part of the farming reforms set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-transition-plan-2021-to-2024">Agricultural Transition Plan</a>, delivering benefits for animal health and welfare, farm productivity, food security, public health, UK trade and the environment.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-for-food-farming-and-the-environment-policy-statement-2020">farming for the future</a> paper provided an outline of the Pathway in February 2020. This paper includes this outline and an update to the Pathway in February 2022.</p>

<h2>What is the Pathway?</h2>

<p>The Pathway involves 3 mutually reinforcing strands.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Financially rewarding farmers who deliver public goods</h3>

<p>As Direct Payments decline, we will reinvest some of the money to support the production of healthier, higher welfare animals. We will provide incentives for farmers to go above the regulatory baseline and reward higher animal health and welfare on the farm. We will focus on improvements which are valued by the public but not sufficiently delivered by the market.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>We will launch the Annual Health and Welfare Review in 2022 as part of the Sustainable Farming Incentive. This fully funded vet visit will be the first step on the Pathway for many farmers.</p>

<p>Rollout of our other financial support - animal health and welfare capital grants, disease eradication and control programmes, and payment-by-results - will follow. The Pathway is a long-term project that will evolve based on the successes it achieves.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#funding-programmes">funding programmes</a> for more details.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Stimulating market demand for higher welfare products</h3>

<p>The majority of consumers value high animal welfare, but this is not fully reflected in what they purchase. We want to make it easier for consumers to purchase food that aligns with their values, by improving transparency and providing the industry with a level playing field to promote such products.</p>

<p>We are looking at potential market interventions such as, labelling and mandatory public disclosure that could improve the accessibility, availability and affordability of higher welfare products for consumers, while driving positive procurement choices by retailers.</p>

<p>This can ensure that the price farmers receive for higher welfare products reflects the value the market attaches to them and that sales reflect true market demand. Unlocking this existing demand means that public money can be more effectively directed to animal welfare interventions which are not yet valued by the market.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>We recently launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/labelling-for-animal-welfare-call-for-evidence">labelling for animal welfare: call for evidence</a>. This sought information to help assess the possible impacts, costs and deliverability of different types of labelling reforms for animal welfare. It also explored how we could build on existing voluntary assurance schemes.</p>

<p>The call for evidence closed on 6 December 2021. Responses will feed into the government’s wider work on food labelling and the Food Strategy White Paper.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Strengthening the regulatory baseline</h3>

<p>We plan to strengthen delivery of the regulatory baseline by improving compliance with our current high standards. Where it is appropriate to raise the bar we will do this in consultation with all relevant sectors and provide sufficient notice of changes so that farmers can plan properly.</p>

<p>We will provide capital grants, partnering with farmers, to transition to a new standard in cases where this delivers good value for money. We want to ensure our future standards are outcomes-focused wherever possible and are subject to less burdensome checks as part of a trust-based relationship between farmers and government.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>We are considering the case for introducing reforms, such as the use of farrowing crates for pigs and enriched cages for laying hens.</p>

<p>The Animals (Penalty Notices) Bill is currently passing through Parliament. This will give powers to issue penalties to those not complying with animal health and welfare regulations.</p>

<p>Later this year we will be publishing further information on our new approach to regulation and enforcement outside the EU.</p>
</div>

<h2>What we want to achieve</h2>

<p>The Pathway is central to the government’s manifesto commitment to protect and enhance farm animal health and welfare, and to maintain and build on our existing world-leading standards. It supports several government strategies by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting farmers to transition to higher welfare practices and systems and encouraging sustainable food production founded upon high-welfare farming - <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/action-plan-for-animal-welfare">Action Plan for Animal Welfare</a>
</li>
  <li>improving biosecurity, which will help manage endemic disease risk and further support our goal to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-next-phase-of-strategy-to-combat-bovine-tuberculosis-in-england">eradicate bovine tuberculosis by 2038</a>
</li>
  <li>tackling anti-microbial resistance, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-action-plan-for-antimicrobial-resistance-2019-to-2024">UK 5-year action plan for antimicrobial resistance</a>
</li>
  <li>reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock through tackling diseases and improving productivity, supporting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy">Net Zero Strategy</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">25 Year Environment Plan</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health and welfare priorities</h3>

<p>The primary goal of the Pathway is to improve farm animal health and welfare across our national herds and flocks. To deliver gradual, yet continual improvement, the Pathway will focus on providing a clear set of priorities that reflect some of the very best opportunities for improving animal health and welfare.</p>

<p>These priorities will guide development of the Pathway, shaping the advice given, information collected and capital grants offered. We will review priorities as we progress along the Pathway, working collaboratively with industry to adapt and learn as we go.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>We have determined animal welfare priorities for each livestock sector on the Pathway through co-design with industry, vets, non-government organisations and welfare scientists. We reached collective agreement on most priorities; some represent compromises between differing stakeholder views. These are presented below alongside priority endemic diseases and conditions published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agricultural-transition-plan-2021-to-2024.">Agricultural Transition Plan</a> in November 2020.</p>

<p>Supporting better stockmanship, particularly through training, will be an overarching priority across all sectors, as a critical enabler for good health and welfare.</p>
</div>

<h2>Meat chickens</h2>

<p>For meat chickens, our priorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>implement&nbsp;the&nbsp;Better Chicken Commitment which requires slower-growing breeds, lower stocking densities and restrictions on thinning birds - these all contribute to improved health and welfare outcomes such as fewer leg disorders</li>
  <li>adopt welfare-improving technology to support&nbsp;environmental and behavioural monitoring&nbsp;and&nbsp;better&nbsp;stockmanship</li>
</ul>

<h2>Laying hens</h2>

<p>For laying hens, our priorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transition out of cages:&nbsp;we are exploring potential reforms around the use of enriched cages for laying hens, which can restrict hens’ normal behaviours such as dustbathing - the&nbsp;Pathway will support producers shifting away from their use</li>
  <li>improve feather cover management:&nbsp;we want to support farmers to address the underlying root causes of feather pecking, reducing the need for infra-red beak trimming</li>
  <li>improve keel bone health to reduce laying hens’ susceptibly to&nbsp;painful fractures which can occur in all production systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pigs</h2>

<p>For pigs, our priorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improve biosecurity to control endemic pig diseases and help prevent the introduction of exotic disease threats</li>
  <li>tackle&nbsp;Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus which costs the industry an estimated&nbsp;£52 million&nbsp;per year and increases antibiotic use</li>
  <li>reduce sow confinement during farrowing&nbsp;by supporting producers in shifting to less confined alternatives for the sow, whilst ensuring the welfare of her piglets and the safety of workers. We are also exploring potential reforms around the use of farrowing crates, which can restrict sows’ normal behaviours such as, nesting</li>
  <li>reduce stressors to keep tails intact: we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;support farmers in addressing the underlying causes&nbsp;of high stress levels in pigs which trigger tail biting, such as, poor environmental enrichment, so that farmers feel confident to not dock tails</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cattle (beef and dairy)</h2>

<p>For beef and dairy cattle, our priorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tackle&nbsp;Bovine Viral Diarrhoea which&nbsp;costs the industry between £14-36 million per year and raises greenhouse gas emissions from cattle</li>
  <li>reduce lameness and mastitis&nbsp;to improve health and welfare, increase productivity and&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;the environmental&nbsp;impacts of farming</li>
  <li>upgrade housing: many&nbsp;farm buildings are not optimally designed for cattle, especially calves - we will encourage improvements in ventilation, cow comfort, loafing areas and enrichments such as scratching brushes</li>
  <li>improve pain management during disbudding, dehorning and castration through greater adoption of&nbsp;prolonged analgesia&nbsp;to&nbsp;improve&nbsp;the welfare and performance of calves</li>
  <li>improve the welfare of cattle at pastures through improvements in shelter, drainage, gateways and tracks that support the normal behaviours associated with grazing and being outdoors</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sheep</h2>

<p>For sheep, our priorities are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a tailored health screening&nbsp;to address&nbsp;a range of endemic diseases,&nbsp;estimated to cost the sector around £85 million per year - initially this will focus on internal and external parasites (and associated anthelmintic efficacy), mastitis, ‘iceberg’ diseases and those inducing abortion</li>
  <li>reduce lameness as it is one of the most common signs of ill health and discomfort among sheep, affecting&nbsp;animals’&nbsp;mobility, productivity and longevity</li>
  <li>improve ewe sustainability, optimising body condition so that ewes are less susceptible to disease, produce better quality milk and can rear a greater number of healthier lambs</li>
  <li>improve pain&nbsp;management during castration and tail docking - we&nbsp;want to support the licensing&nbsp;and uptake&nbsp;of pain relief&nbsp;to&nbsp;reduce the impact of these&nbsp;procedures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Funding programmes</h2>

<p>The Pathway’s first strand (financially rewarding farmers who deliver public goods) involves 4 funding programmes.</p>

<p>These all work together to deliver our health and welfare priorities, providing funding for high-quality veterinary advice, capital investment and ongoing costs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Annual Health and Welfare Review (the Review planned for 2022)</h3>

<p>The Review will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>offer farmers funding for an annual visit from a vet of their choice to consider the health and welfare of their animals. This includes carrying out diagnostic testing, reviewing biosecurity and the use of medicines, and provide bespoke advice on actions and available support to improve the health and welfare of their animals</li>
  <li>add value to existing practices and assurance scheme requirements and build upon the strong relationships that already exist between farmers and vets</li>
</ul>

<p>The Review is initially for cattle, sheep and pig farmers who are eligible for the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) and who have more than 10 cattle, 20 sheep or 50 pigs.</p>

<p>We aim to make the Review available to farmers not currently participating in the <abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Our intent is that this is a time limited offer for 3 years. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the Review and consult on the need for further regulation beyond this timeframe.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>Information will be collected and shared anonymously with Defra to build a better understanding of the health and welfare of the national herd and flock.</p>

<p>We will use this to track progress and develop future policy through the Pathway, not for any regulatory or inspection activity.</p>

<p>More detailed information, including payment rates is available as part of our December 2021 policy update paper for the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainable-farming-incentive-how-the-scheme-will-work-in-2022/sustainable-farming-incentive-how-the-scheme-will-work-in-2022">Sustainable Farming Incentive</a>.</p>

<h4>What’s next?</h4>

<p>The Review will launch in 2022 and continue to develop as new parts of the Pathway become available to farmers. The work vets and farmers do as part of the Review will help drive and inform next steps on the Pathway, including grants and disease control or eradication.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Animal health and welfare capital grants (planned for late 2022)</h3>

<p>Farmers can apply for grants to co-fund capital investments to support the delivery of the published health and welfare priorities. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smaller grants, where farmers can select from a list of equipment and technology items</li>
  <li>larger grants, for bespoke infrastructure projects such as new housing, building upgrades and pasture improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>The competitive grants will initially be open to livestock farmers with cattle, pigs, sheep, meat chickens and laying hens. In future years of the programme, we hope to expand to other livestock farmers such as those with goats, ducks, or turkeys.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>A farmer will need to agree with their vet the most appropriate investments for their farm and animals.</p>

<p>They can seek advice as part of the Review, a routine vet visit or a phone call with their local vet.</p>

<h4>What’s next?</h4>

<p>We will now be collecting suggestions online for what to include in our grants offer. This will give farmers, vets, academics and other industry stakeholders the opportunity to recommend which capital items best support the delivery of the priorities. In selecting items, we will be guided by the principles of ensuring good value for public money and increasing the uptake of technology and equipment which is not already in widespread use. Farmers should receive a link to a questionnaire through key industry associations.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Disease eradication and control programmes (from 2023)</h3>

<p>Farmers will be able to apply for financial support to prevent and reduce endemic diseases and conditions, building on the initial advice given in the Review.</p>

<p>The programmes will target our initial priority endemic diseases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bovine Viral Diarrhoea in cows</li>
  <li>Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus in pigs</li>
  <li>tailored health screening for sheep focusing on a range of priority endemic diseases and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The programmes are likely to focus on cattle, pig and sheep farmers initially and will be targeted at maximising the delivery of public goods, including climate change mitigation, slowing the rise of anti-microbial resistance and improving biosecurity.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>We are actively co-designing programmes to improve health and control or eradicate priority diseases with farmers, vets, scientists and others.</p>

<h4>What’s next?</h4>

<p>The programmes may involve diagnostic testing, veterinary advice, vaccination, improvements to on-farm management or active management planning. As for the Review, financial support may be timebound and work in concert with a rising regulatory baseline where appropriate.</p>

<p>Farmers may be expected to take on some of the cost associated with taking effective action, recognising the benefit to their businesses from improved livestock health.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Payment-by-results (trialling in 2023, possibly transitioning to full-scale offer from 2025)</h3>

<p>Payment-by-results is a new and innovative approach which could reward farmers who demonstrate high animal health and welfare outcomes by contributing to the ongoing costs associated with higher welfare practices (‘enhancements’).</p>

<p>We are currently assessing which livestock farmers could be eligible and are considering those keeping dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, sheep, laying hens and meat chickens. This will depend on the outcomes of external research.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>What’s new? (update February 2022)</h4>

<p>Our external research project concludes in early 2022. It will identify whether there are enhancements that deliver our animal health and welfare priorities as well as being good value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<h4>What’s next?</h4>

<p>Subject to these research conclusions, we will select some initial enhancements to trial before potentially launching a full-scale offer if supported by the trial learnings. The outcomes of the research and detail on the scope and content of any trial will be published later in 2022.</p>
