<p>Enter the code relevant to the lease:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residential R</li>

  <li>mixed M</li>
</ul>

<p>The code you enter must match the code you selected for question 16 on the SDLT1 return.</p>

<p>More information about types of lease is in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-duty-land-tax-manual/sdltm62040">SDLTM62040 of the HMRC <abbr title="Stamp Duty Land Tax">SDLT</abbr> Manual</a>.</p>

<h3>Question 17 — ‘Start date as specified in lease’</h3>

<p>Enter the start date as shown in the lease. If the date is in the future, use that.</p>

<p>The date must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy, for example 30/08/2012.</p>

<p>If the date is any earlier than 01/01/1500, enter 01/01/1500 as the start date. Earlier dates will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Question 18 — ‘End date as specified in lease’</h3>

<p>For periodic tenancy, enter the date the first period ends.</p>

<p>Date must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy, for example 30/08/2012.</p>

<p>If the lease ends after 9999, enter 31/12/9999 as the end date.</p>

<p>Enter the number of months for any period where the tenant will not have to pay rent starting from the effective date at question 4 of the SDLT1 return or, if later, the term commencement date.</p>

<p>If the rent-free period is more than 99 months, enter 99. Round up to a whole number of months.</p>

<p>If there is no rent-free period leave the answer blank.</p>

<h3>Question 20 — ‘Annual starting rent inclusive of VAT actually payable’</h3>

<p>There are 3 parts to this question:</p>

<h4>First part</h4>

<p>‘New and existing leases’: enter the rent payable at either the effective date at question 4, or the rent start date, whichever is later. If the rent is a peppercorn or no rent is payable, enter ‘O’.</p>

<p>‘Bringing a lease to an end’: enter the final rent immediately before the effective date.</p>

<h4>Second part</h4>

<p>‘Enter the date that the starting rent will end’: the date must be in the format dd/mm/yyyy, for example 30/08/201.  If the year is after 9999, enter 9999. If a lease has been surrendered this will normally be the same as the effective date at question 4 of the SDLT1 return.</p>

<h4>Third part</h4>

<p>‘Is the later rent known?’: If the amount of rent is payable after the date in part 2 answer ‘Yes’, if it is not known answer ‘No’.</p>

<h3>Question 21 — ‘What is the amount of VAT, if any?’</h3>

<p>Enter the amount of VAT charged included in the starting rent at question 20, plus any VAT included in the total premium payable shown at question 22.</p>

<p>If there is no VAT leave the box blank.</p>

<h3>Questions 22 to 25</h3>
