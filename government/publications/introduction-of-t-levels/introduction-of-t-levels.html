<h2>T Levels: what they are</h2>

<p>T Levels are new courses which follow GCSEs and are equivalent to 3 A levels. These 2-year courses, which launched in September 2020, have been developed in collaboration with employers and education providers so that the content meets the needs of industry and prepares students for work, further training, or further study.</p>

<p>T Levels offer students a mixture of classroom learning and on-the-job experience through an industry placement of at least 315 hours - approximately 45 days.</p>

<p>The courses are available at selected colleges, schools and other providers across England.</p>

<h2>Starting dates</h2>

<p>T Levels are being gradually rolled out. The first 3 T Levels launched in September 2020, with a further 7 introduced in September 2021.</p>

<p>In September 2022, an additional 6 T Levels will be launched, with the remaining 7 beginning in September 2023.</p>

<p>We have published a list of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">providers offering T Level courses up to September 2023</a>.</p>

<h2>How T Levels will work with other qualifications</h2>

<p>T Levels will become one of the main choices for students after GCSEs alongside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apprenticeships for students who wish to learn a specific occupation ‘on the job’</li>
  <li>A levels for students who wish to continue academic education</li>
  <li>other qualifications not served by A levels or T levels, including sport science, performing arts and small qualifications designed to be taken alongside A levels</li>
</ul>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) is streamlining and improving the quality of the post-16 level 3 qualifications system. We are strengthening progression pathways, creating clearly defined academic and technical routes with high quality qualifications leading to further study, and/or skilled employment. This will help students to make good choices and see more easily how their study will help them to progress.</p>

<p>T Levels are based on the same standards as apprenticeships, designed by employers and approved by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/t-levels/" rel="external">Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (<abbr title="Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education">the Institute</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>We expect the total time for a T Level to be around 1,800 hours over the 2 years, including the industry placement. This is a significant increase on most current technical education courses.</p>

<p>T Levels differ from an apprenticeship. T Levels prepare students for work, further training or further study. An apprenticeship is typically 80% on-the-job and 20% in the classroom and is more suited to those who want to earn a wage and learn at the same time, and are ready to enter the workforce at age 16.</p>

<h2>How T Levels have been developed</h2>

<p>Employers and providers have been working together to develop each T Level, with support from <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and <abbr title="Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education">the Institute</abbr>. Groups of employers have defined the skills and requirements for each T Level course by participating in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-panels-membership">T Level panels</a>. This ensures that students taking T Levels will develop the technical knowledge and skills required by employers in that industry.</p>

<p>The T Level panels have developed the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/t-levels/" rel="external">content for the technical qualifications which are part of each T Level programme</a>, based on the same standards as apprenticeships. These plans are then tested and reviewed with students, education providers and additional employers.</p>

<p>The technical qualifications for 2020, 2021 and 2022 T Levels have now been approved by <abbr title="Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education">the Institute</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Structure of a T Level</h2>

<p>T Levels require students to undertake both a technical qualification and an industry placement with an employer.</p>

<p>Students will also be required to work towards the attainment of maths and English if they have not already achieved grade 4 at GCSE, as they do on other 16 to 19 programmes. However, T Level students are no longer required to achieve either a grade 4 in English and maths GCSE or level 2 in functional skills to pass their programme.</p>

<h2>Transition Programme</h2>

<p>The T Level Transition Programme is a 1-year post-GCSE study programme designed to support progression to, and success on, a T Level. It’s aimed at students who would like to do a T Level but would benefit from additional preparation and support before starting one.</p>

<p>The programme gives students the opportunity to study technical content aligned to T Levels and develop their English, maths and digital skills, alongside work experience and personal development.</p>

<p>You can see a list of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/providers-selected-to-deliver-t-levels">providers delivering the Transition Programme in 2021 to 2022 and those planning to deliver in 2022 to 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-level-transition-programme-framework-for-delivery-2022-to-2023">T Level Transition Programme Framework for Delivery</a> has guidance on how the programme should be delivered from academic year 2022 onwards.</p>

<h2>Industry placements</h2>

<p>Every T Level includes an industry placement with an employer focused on developing the practical and technical skills required for the occupation. These will last a minimum of 315 hours (approximately 45 days) but can last longer.</p>

<p>Employers can offer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/industry-placements">industry placements</a> as a block, day release or a mix of these, and can discuss sharing part of the placement with another employer if necessary.</p>

<p>Providers will support employers offering industry placements. This will include assistance with paperwork, a careful planning process and support with designing the industry placement.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s employer engagement teams are working with employers of all sizes and providers on industry placements.</p>

<p>Employers interested in finding out more about industry placements can contact 08000 150 600, email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tlevel.placement@education.gov.uk">tlevel.placement@education.gov.uk</a> or visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tlevels.gov.uk/employers" rel="external">employers section of the T Levels website</a></p>

<h2>Grading and certification</h2>

<p>Students who complete their T Level will get a nationally recognised certificate which will show their overall grade and a breakdown of what they have achieved.</p>

<p>The T Level certificate will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overall grade for the T Level, shown as pass, merit, distinction or distinction*</li>
  <li>a separate grade for the core component, using A* to E</li>
  <li>a separate grade for each occupational specialism, shown as pass, merit or distinction</li>
</ul>

<p>It will also confirm that the student has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>completed the industry placement</li>
  <li>met any additional mandatory requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>A student’s overall T Level grade will be worked out from the grades they achieved on the core component and the occupational specialism(s).</p>

<p>Students who do not pass all elements of their T Level will get a T Level statement of achievement which will show the elements they have completed.</p>

<p>If students have attained maths and/or English qualifications at level 2, this will also be referenced on T Level certificates and statements of achievement.</p>

<h2>Entry to higher education and UCAS tariff points</h2>

<p>T Levels will provide several progression options for students. These include skilled employment, an apprenticeship and higher education.</p>

<p>To help T Level students progress into higher education, UCAS tariff points will be allocated to T Levels.</p>

<p>UCAS points will only be allocated to the overall T Level grade. Students must achieve at least an overall pass grade to receive UCAS points.</p>

<h2>Register to deliver T Levels</h2>

<p>Providers can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-in-2023-to-2024-academic-year">register to deliver T Levels from September 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The closing date for registration is midnight on 29 July 2022. We recommend that providers register as early as possible so they can take advantage of support that will be offered.</p>

<p>Providers can also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-register-to-deliver-t-levels-from-2024-to-2025-academic-year?msclkid=1d22edffaf5011ecb65164147c27c1f9">register to deliver T Levels from September 2024</a>.</p>

<h2>Funding for providers</h2>

<p>We recognise that significant additional funding will be needed for the successful introduction and delivery of T Levels.</p>

<p>T Levels involve more hours than most current technical qualifications at level 3 and providers will be funded for the extra hours involved and for organising industry placements.</p>

<p>Our guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/t-levels-next-steps-for-providers">T Levels: next steps for providers</a> has more information on how T Levels will be funded.</p>

<p>All T Level providers will receive funding for state-of-the-art specialist equipment and all providers, apart from independent training providers, can bid for funding to refurbish existing facilities or build new buildings. Over £400m has been made available so far for T Levels capital.</p>

<p>You can find more information at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/t-levels-capital-fund">T Levels capital fund</a>.</p>

<h2>Support for professional development</h2>
