<h2>How operational support payments are calculated and made</h2>

<p>A similar budgeting process continues to apply under the more recent National Rail Contracts (<abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr>) and emergency recovery measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr>) as under the emergency measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>). Specifically, the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) agrees a budget for each period with each train operating company (<abbr title="train operating company">TOC</abbr>).</p>

<p>This budget is reviewed by the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forecasts of costs</li>
  <li>capital expenditure</li>
  <li>revenue</li>
</ul>

<p>Operational support payments are generally made from the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> to the <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> on the first weekday of each period. Each periodic franchise payment initially comprises a ‘forward-looking’ forecast for costs and capital expenditure for that period, less a ‘backwards-looking’ estimate for revenue received for the previous period.</p>

<p>The forecasts of costs and capital expenditure are taken from the <abbr title="train operating company">TOC</abbr>’s periodic budget. The revenue estimate may come from either the <abbr title="train operating company">TOC</abbr>’s budget or the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s own estimates based on the most recently available industry data on ticket sales.</p>

<p>Each periodic franchise payment also includes an adjustment based on the difference between these initial values (for costs, capital expenditure and revenues) and the actual values, as reported in the management accounts submitted by the <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> to the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>While the initial payment is made on the first weekday of a period, the management accounts are submitted within 10 weekdays following the end of the period. Under the <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>, there was therefore a 2-period interval between the initial payment and the adjustment. This adjustment interval has now been extended to 3 periods under the <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr> to allow more time for adjustments to be calculated and reviewed. The Period 6 payment (the final period of the <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>) was the first to be affected by this change.</p>

<p>This adjustment process can lead to either upward or downward movement in the operational support payments as actual values for costs, capital expenditure and revenues can be higher or lower than the initial values.</p>

<p>For any given period, the total franchise payment is therefore made in 2 stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the first is made on the first weekday of the period, based on forecast costs and estimated revenues</li>
  <li>the second is made 2 periods later (extended to 3 periods following the introduction of <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr>) and ensures the total net payment reflects actual costs and revenues as reported in <abbr title="train operating company">TOC</abbr> management accounts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope of the periodic payment data</h2>

<p>The <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027317/operational-payments-to-tocs-under-emergency-agreements-and-nrcs.ods">operational payments to <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> under emergency agreements and <abbr title="National Rail Contracts">NRCs</abbr> data</a> includes both stages of the operational support payment, as described above, for all periods shown; however, it does not include any allowance for the effect of future payments, and future adjustments that may partly relate to these periods, unless explicitly stated. These future payments and adjustments may include longer-term retrospective adjustments to reconcile payments to full audited <abbr title="train operating company">TOC</abbr> accounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027320/ema-and-erma-performance-scores-and-fees.ods" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Management and performance fees</a> due to the <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> are also excluded from this operational support data.</p>

<h2>Exceptions to standard arrangements</h2>

<p>During the period covered by this data, 2 franchises were in public ownership – East Coast and Northern. These 2 franchises were not operating under emergency agreements as the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> already had full responsibility for their costs and revenues. Their payment data is shown here for completeness and comparability. Payments to these franchises continued to be made in accordance with their existing services agreements. No management or performance fees were payable to these 2 <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Two further franchises – Great Western and South Eastern – were previously operating under franchise agreements that expired on 31 March 2020. During the period covered by this data, they were operating under new franchise agreements, beginning on 1 April 2020, that were signed alongside their <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> in late March 2020. Both franchises have different <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> term lengths, and other smaller differences to standard <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> arrangements.</p>

<p>One franchise – Cross Country – had an <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> that was one rail period longer than the standard term to coincide with the end date of its previous franchise agreement in October 2020. A directly-awarded franchise agreement, of 3 years’ duration with an extension option of up to 1 year, came into effect when this ended on 18 October 2020.</p>

<p>This agreement includes various bespoke requirements specific to this franchise, but the core commercial arrangements – whereby <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> receives revenue collected and pays most costs incurred through a regular franchise payment – are consistent with those used in the <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr>.</p>
