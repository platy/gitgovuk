<p>The emergency measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr>) signed in March 2020 stated that operator performance would be assessed against the scorecard set out in the <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> Schedule (Schedule 8B for the majority of train operators) for the period 1 April 2020 to 20 September 2020 and for the period 20 September 2020 to 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The emergency recovery measures agreements (<abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr>) signed in September 2020 stated that operator performance would be assessed against the scorecard set out in the <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> Schedule (Schedule 8.1B for the majority of train operators) for the period 20 September 2020 to 31 March 2021.</p>

<h2>Scorecard criteria</h2>

<p>The 3 <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> scorecard criteria were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operational performance</li>
  <li>customer experience</li>
  <li>acting as a good and efficient operator</li>
</ul>

<p>The 4 <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> scorecard criteria were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operational performance</li>
  <li>customer experience</li>
  <li>financial performance</li>
  <li>
    <p>collaborative behaviours, split by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>with Network Rail and other industry partners</li>
      <li>with the Secretary of State for Transport</li>
      <li>with other stakeholders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each franchisee was awarded a score and corresponding payment individually for each criterion of either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Below acceptable standard – no performance payment.</li>
  <li>Acceptable – partial performance payment.</li>
  <li>Good – full performance payment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only full integer scores of 1, 2 or 3 were awarded.</p>

<h2>How scores relate to performance payments</h2>

<p>For train operators under <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> contracts, a maximum of 0.5% of franchise historical costs (effectively the operating cost base of the franchise before the COVID-19 pandemic began) were available as performance payments, equally divided across the 3 criteria.</p>

<p>For train operators under <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> contracts, a maximum of 1% of franchise historical costs (effectively the operating cost base of the franchise before the COVID-19 pandemic began) were available as performance payments, divided across the 4 weighted criteria, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% operational performance</li>
  <li>22.5% customer experience</li>
  <li>30% financial performance</li>
  <li>22.5% collaborative behaviours</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, the maximum fee for a score of 3 (good) is on a single criterion is a third of the respective <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> or <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> historical cost figure. A score of 2 (acceptable) would receive 40% of this amount and 1 (below acceptable) would not receive any payment.</p>

<h2>The <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> assessment process</h2>

<p>The assessment of the scorecards for both <abbr title="emergency measures agreements">EMAs</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreements">ERMAs</abbr> was made after the end of the respective period on the basis of evidence that was collected by the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) and franchisee during the period.</p>

<p>The evaluation was undertaken by independent evaluators who all received compulsory pre-evaluation training. This ensured each franchisee was fairly evaluated, and an objective view on performance was determined based on the review of evidence in comparison to the scorecard criteria. The evaluations were then subsequently moderated and subject to independent assurance to ensure all franchisees had been treated consistently.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/public-register-of-rail-passenger-franchise-agreements" class="govuk-link">scorecard criteria for each <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> operator</a>.</p>

<p>Scoring was undertaken ‘in the round’ for each criterion. For example, although there was a single overall score for the customer experience, this involved a number of elements (station and train cleanliness, maintenance, staff deployment and the passenger journey experience). The evaluation score, therefore, reflected the overall score for those elements taken together, in each case using the judgement of the independent evaluators.</p>

<p>The <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027320/ema-and-erma-performance-scores-and-fees.ods" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> performance scores and fees data</a> show <abbr title="emergency measures agreement">EMA</abbr> and <abbr title="emergency recovery measures agreement">ERMA</abbr> management fees and any performance payments that are payable.</p>

<p>Subject to other conditions, actual payment will be made to the <abbr title="train operating companies">TOCs</abbr> after the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has received annual audited accounts and other financial reporting for the franchisee year.</p>
