    <p>Clean and dry a surface and place the home test kit contents on it.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Find your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox or contact 0800 0511 811 to book a courier</h2>

<h4>It is very important that the day before you take your sample, you check collection times at your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox. You need to post your completed test kit by midday.</h4>

<p>As soon as you receive your test kit, check collection times at your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox. You need to post your completed test kit by midday.</p>

<p>As weekend and bank holiday collection times may differ from weekdays, it is important to look at collection times for the day you will be sending back your test (3 days before the day of procedure). If you can’t locate a priority postbox with a collection on that day, book a courier using the number below.</p>

<p>To check collection times at your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to Royal Mail: services near you</li>
  <li>Click the ‘Show my nearest priority postboxes’ tickbox</li>
  <li>Enter the postcode of where you’re staying and select the address</li>
  <li>View priority postboxes near you and check the collection times</li>
</ol>

<h3>If you are unable to post your kit in a priority postbox</h3>

<p>Contact 0800 0511 811 to book a courier as soon as you receive your test kit.</p>

<p>To book your courier, call 0800 0511 811 as soon as you receive your test kit, between 8am and 6pm.</p>

<p>Your courier will arrive between 8am and 6pm on the day of collection.</p>

<p>If you are returning your test using a courier, take your test by 7am on the day of collection to give yourself enough time before the courier arrives.</p>

<p>More information on booking a courier is included below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Prepare to do the test on yourself or someone else</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Take your test by 7am at the latest on the day you will post your kit, 3 days before your procedure, to give yourself enough time to post your sample.</p>
</div>

<h3>Prepare to take the sample</h3>

<p>Avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes before doing the test to reduce the risk of spoiling the test.</p>

<p>Taking the test may feel a little uncomfortable and unusual.</p>

<p>If you are doing the test on a child or someone else, talk through the steps together. Remain calm and confident as you go through the process.</p>

<p>Watch a video showing how to take a swab test. The following video shows how to take a UK home test. Exact models may vary.</p>

<p>Tips for testing a child:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the hospital where the procedure will take place if you cannot do the test</li>
  <li>try to explain the test to the child in words they can understand</li>
  <li>some children may feel more comfortable sitting on a caregiver’s lap</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Take the swab sample</h2>

<p>1. Look inside the mouth and find the tonsils (or the area where they would be if you do not have them) at the back of the throat. This is where you’ll take the swab sample. You can use a torch and a mirror to help you.</p>

<p>If testing someone else, ask them to say ‘ahhhh’ loudly for 5 seconds, so that you can see their tonsils.</p>

<p>Tip for a child: If you cannot swab their tonsils, swab both of their nostrils for 10 to 15 seconds instead. The result may be less accurate.</p>

<p>2. Gently blow the nose and cough into a tissue so excess mucus does not spoil the test. Throw the tissue away in a closed bin.</p>

<p>3. Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds using soap and warm water before handling the test kit to avoid contaminating it.</p>

<p>4. Open the package and gently take out the swab. You will need to use this for both tonsils and nose.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Try not to touch your tongue, teeth, cheeks, gums, or any other surfaces with the swab’s fabric tip, as this may spoil your sample. If this does happen, complete and return the test anyway.</p>
</div>

<p>5. Holding the swab between your fingers, open the mouth wide and gently rub the swab’s fabric tip over both tonsils at the back of the throat. Do this with firm contact 4 times on each side.</p>

<p>Use a torch and mirror to help you.</p>

<p>If testing someone else, get them to say ‘ahhh’ loudly while you take the sample.</p>

<p>When the swab touches the tonsils, it may cause some gagging or brief discomfort, but it should not hurt.</p>

<p>6. Put the same end of the same swab gently into the nostril about 2.5cm (1 inch) or until you feel some resistance. Roll the swab firmly around the inside of the nostril, making 10 complete circles and slowly remove it. If you or they have a nose-piercing, use the other nostril.</p>

<p>This may feel uncomfortable. Do not insert the swab any deeper if there’s a feeling of strong resistance or pain.</p>

<p>7. Screw the lid off the plastic tube, while keeping it upright so the liquid stays inside. Take care not to let the fabric tip touch anything. Put the swab into it with the fabric tip facing down.</p>

<p>8. Snap off the stick end of the swab, so that it fits inside the tube without bending.</p>

<p>9. Securely screw the lid on so no liquid can leak.</p>

<p>The liquid must stay in the tube.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Package the test kit</h2>

<p>Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds using soap and warm water.</p>

<p>Make sure the barcodes on the plastic tube and the leak-proof bag match. Place the absorbent pad into the leak-proof bag. Put the tube next to the absorbent pad in the same bag.</p>

<p>Let some air out of the leak-proof bag and then seal it using its adhesive seal.</p>

<p>Follow the assembly instructions on the return box. If you can, wipe down the bag and box with an antiseptic wipe. Put the leak-proof bag into the box and close the box.</p>

<p>Apply the security seal as directed.</p>

<p>Take a picture or note of the barcode on your Royal Mail return label for reference.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you need help, call 0800 0511 811.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> 	Post your completed test kit or await your courier collection</h2>

<p>Post the completed test kit 3 days before the day of your procedure by 12pm and no later than one hour before the last collection time (weekend and bank holiday collection times may differ from weekdays).</p>

<p>Only use a Royal Mail priority postbox with the label and one of the NHS regional logos.</p>

<p>Follow the government’s social distancing guidelines, wear a mask and do not take public transport. You must not enter any Post Office with your test kit.</p>

<p>Find your nearest priority postbox and its collection times.</p>

<p>Track your delivery using your Royal Mail return label barcode.</p>

<h4>Giving a completed test kit box to the courier</h4>

<p>Three days before the day of your procedure. This is only required if you are unable to post your kit through a priority postbox.</p>

<p>Your courier will arrive between 8am and 6pm on the day of collection, the day you take your test, 3 days before the day of your procedure.</p>

<p>Make sure you are ready with your completed test during this time. Do not place the return box outside until the courier arrives. Do not take the return box to the Post Office.</p>

<p>The courier will knock on your door or ring your doorbell and then move at least 2 metres away.</p>

<p>After they move away, open your door, place the return box outside and then close the door.</p>

<p>The courier will deliver your test kit box to a laboratory.</p>

<p>If your test kit is not collected by 6pm or you missed your courier, call 0800 0511 811.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Get test result by text</h2>
