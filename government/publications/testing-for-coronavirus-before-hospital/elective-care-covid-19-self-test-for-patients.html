<h2>Ownership of the personal data</h2>

<p>To enable the COVID-19 testing to be completed, NHS trusts that use the Elective Care COVID-19 Home Testing Service (<abbr title="Elective Care COVID-19 Home Testing Service">ECCHTS</abbr>) need to process your personal data, including the sharing of your personal data where this is allowed under data protection legislation. NHS trusts are the data controllers for the data required, for the ordering of tests kits and implementing local arrangements based on a patient’s test result.</p>
