<p>This document has been designed to provide patients with additional support and guidance on how and when to complete the necessary tasks required in their COVID-19 home test kit journey.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction to the COVID-19 home testing service for upcoming hospital procedures</h2>

<p>This service provides NHS elective care patients with a COVID-19 home testing kit ahead of an upcoming hospital procedure. Elective care patients are those who need to undergo a procedure during a day visit to the hospital or with an overnight stay. It does not include patients who need urgent treatment. Patients will receive delivery of the test kit with dedicated instructions straight to their home and will return their kit at their nearest Royal Mail priority postbox, or if they are unable to do this they can arrange for a courier collection. This allows patients to take the test safely at home on the correct day (3 days before their procedure) and self-isolate until the day of their procedure. Both the hospital and patient will receive the test results ahead of the procedure date.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>Important: you must take your COVID-19 swab test exactly 3 days before the day of your procedure</p>
</div>

<h2>Understanding your test results</h2>

<p>If your test comes back as positive or unclear, please immediately contact the hospital to discuss next steps.</p>

<p>If the result is negative, please continue to self-isolate and go to hospital on the day of the procedure.</p>

<h2>Identifying the correct days on when to complete each step of your COVID-19 test</h2>

<p>It is important to complete each step as laid out in the instruction manual found in your test kit. This will help to ensure you receive your test result ahead your procedure date. The table below (also found on page 3 of the instruction manual) can be used to help identify which days you should complete each task:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Circle the day of your procedure on the top row. For example, if your hospital procedure is on a Monday, please circle Monday.</li>
  <li>Below the procedure date you have circled, are the days you must complete the necessary steps.</li>
</ol>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Day of your procedure</th>
      <th scope="col">Mon</th>
      <th scope="col">Tue</th>
      <th scope="col">Wed</th>
      <th scope="col">Thurs</th>
      <th scope="col">Fri</th>
      <th scope="col">Sat</th>
      <th scope="col">Sun</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>3 days before your procedure: prepare, take and package swab sample, then return your test kit</td>
      <td>Fri</td>
      <td>Sat</td>
      <td>Sun</td>
      <td>Mon</td>
      <td>Tue</td>
      <td>Wed</td>
      <td>Thu</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if you have a procedure on the fourth day of the month, then you must take your swab on the first day of the month. (You can calculate when to take your test by subtracting 3 days from your procedure date.)</p>

<p>For further help with understanding when to complete the different steps of the COVID-19 home test journey, please call the free support number provided in the instruction manual.</p>

<h2>Home test efficacy</h2>

<p>Medical studies have proven that home test kits are highly effective, and have been fully approved by the NHS.</p>

<h2>Taking a swab sample</h2>

<p>It is very important you follow the step-by-step guide on how to complete the test provided in the instruction manual within your test kit. This will ensure the best chance of you receiving a test result ahead of your upcoming procedure.</p>

<p>Please refer to the instruction manual on how to correctly complete the test on day 3 before the procedure. If you are struggling and unable to take the sample, please contact the hospital that referred you as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Health data privacy and security</h2>

<p>Under no circumstances will your personal data be shared with any third parties, including the delivery company involved in transporting the test kits to and from your house.</p>

<h2>Returning your test kit</h2>

<p>It is very important that the day before you take your sample, you check collection times at your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox. You need to post your completed test kit 3 days before the day of your procedure, by midday.</p>

<p>As weekend and bank holiday collection times may differ from weekdays, it is important to look at collection times for the day you will be sending back your test (3 days before the day of your procedure). If you cannot locate a priority postbox with a collection on that day, book a courier using the information provided in the instruction manual.</p>

<p>To check collection times at your nearest Royal Mail priority postbox:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalmail.com/services-near-you#/" rel="external">Royal Mail: services near you</a>
</li>
  <li>Click the âShow my nearest priority postboxesâ tickbox</li>
  <li>Enter the postcode of where youâre staying and select the address</li>
  <li>View priority postboxes near you and check the collection times</li>
</ol>

<h3>If you cannot get to a priority postbox</h3>

<p>Call the free support number provided in the instruction manual for guidance on when to take your test and how to book a courier collection if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>unable to get to a priority postbox without using public transport</li>
  <li>to return your kit on a weekend or bank holiday and the priority postboxes near you do not offer weekend collections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Damaged or missing parts to your test kit</h2>

<p>If the swab or any other parts from your test kit in the checklist found on page 5 of the instruction manual are missing, please contact the hospital that referred you as soon as possible, they may be able to deliver a new swab.</p>

<p>Please securely package the incomplete or damaged test kit (as if it were being returned via courier), then put it in a bin bag, seal the bin bag, and dispose of it.</p>

<p>Please contact the hospital to inform them you have been unable to complete the test due to the kit being incomplete or damaged and the hospital will advise next steps.</p>

<h2>Receiving your COVID-19 test result ahead of your upcoming hospital procedure</h2>

<p>Please ensure you complete all the necessary steps as laid out in the instruction manual provided within your test kit to ensure your result is returned to you ahead of your hospital procedure. The lab will process your test sample as a top priority and you will receive the result via text.</p>

<p>If you have not received your test result on the day before your procedure or if you have further concerns about the procedure going ahead, please call the hospital to discuss how they wish to proceed.</p>
