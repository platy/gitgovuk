<h2>
<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S01: coverage</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The proportion of babies <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#eligible">eligible</a> for newborn hearing screening for whom the screening process is complete by 4 weeks <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#corrected-age">corrected age</a> (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#hospital-programme">hospital programmes</a> – well babies, neonatal intensive care unit (<abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr>) babies) or by 5 weeks corrected age (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#community-programme">community programmes</a> – well babies).</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>This standard is needed to provide assurance that screening is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#offer">offered</a> to parents of all eligible babies and that each baby (for whom the offer is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#informed-choice-to-accept-screening">accepted</a>) has a completed screening outcome.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#numerator">Numerator</a>: number of eligible babies with a complete screen.</p>

<p>This is the number of babies for whom a decision about referral or discharge from the screening programmes is made within an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#effective-timeframe">effective timeframe</a> and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>babies for whom a conclusive screening result was available by 4 weeks corrected age (hospital programmes – well babies, <abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr> babies) or by 5 weeks corrected age (community programmes – well babies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>babies referred to an audiology department because a newborn hearing screening encounter was inconclusive or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#contraindicated">contraindicated</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The screening outcomes that comprise a complete screen are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#clear-response-cr">clear response (<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>)</a> – no follow-up required</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr> – targeted follow-up required</li>
  <li>no clear response (<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr>) – bilateral referral, unilateral referral</li>
  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled</li>
  <li>incomplete – screening contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#denominator">Denominator</a>: number of eligible babies born within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#reporting-period">reporting period</a> whose mother was registered with a GP practice within the clinical commissioning group (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>), or (if not registered with any practice) resident within the area covered by the provider <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> site or <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> area, excluding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any baby who died before screening could be completed</li>
  <li>babies that have not reached 4 weeks corrected age (hospital programmes – well babies, <abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr> babies) or 5 weeks corrected age (community programmes – well babies) at the time of the report</li>
  <li>babies born in England and have had their record transferred electronically to Wales</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<p>Corrected age is used for babies born at &lt;40 weeks gestation.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#coverage">Coverage</a> is defined as a screening outcome set on the national IT system for <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>, accepting that the screen may be incomplete.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 98.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.5%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following babies are included in the denominator but may not be screened by <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> and therefore not included in the numerator. The following babies should be accounted for and the reason explained in the commentary as mitigations against performance thresholds. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies who have attained the required age (described above) but whose screening was delayed because they are not well enough</li>
  <li>babies who are eligible for screening but were screened by one of the other home countries (Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales)</li>
  <li>babies born in US Air Force bases</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S02: test: well babies who do not show a clear response in both ears at automated otoacoustic emission 1 (<abbr title="automated otoacoustic emission 1">AOAE1</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Test performance.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>This standard is needed to monitor the performance of the screening test and to minimise harm.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of well babies who do not show a clear response in both ears at <abbr title="automated otoacoustic emission 1">AOAE1</abbr>.</p>

<p>The possible outcomes at <abbr title="automated otoacoustic emission 1">AOAE1</abbr> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>/<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr>/<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>

</li>
  <li>

</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="not complete">NC</abbr>/<abbr title="not done">ND</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The numerator includes all combinations except <abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>/<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of well babies who have any <abbr title="automated otoacoustic emission 1">AOAE1</abbr> test.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Hospital programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acceptable level: ≤ 27.0%</li>
  <li>Achievable level: ≤ 22.0%</li>
</ul>

<p>Community programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acceptable level: ≤ 15.0%</li>
  <li>Achievable level: ≤ 13.5%</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a negative polarity standard which means a lower percentage is better.</p>

<p>The variation in thresholds shows that community programmes typically screen babies at a later age and therefore pass rates are higher.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S03: test: referral rate to diagnostic audiological assessment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Test performance.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>This standard is needed to monitor the performance of the screening test at the final result of the screen in order to minimise harm.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of babies that receive a no clear response result in one or both ears or other result that requires an immediate onward referral for audiological assessment.</p>

<p>The screening outcomes who require a diagnostic referral within the national IT system for newborn hearing screening are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr> – bilateral referral, unilateral referral</li>
  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled</li>
  <li>incomplete – screening contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<p>Denominator: number of eligible babies with a complete screen. This is the number of babies for whom a decision about referral or discharge from the screening programme is made and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies for whom a conclusive screening result was available</li>
  <li>babies referred to an audiology department because a newborn hearing screening encounter was inconclusive or contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<p>The screening outcomes that comprise a complete screen within the national IT system for newborn hearing screening are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr> – no follow-up required</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr> – targeted follow-up required</li>

  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled</li>
  <li>incomplete – screening contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Hospital programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acceptable level: ≤ 3.0%</li>
  <li>Achievable level: ≤ 2.0%</li>
</ul>

<p>Community programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acceptable level: ≤ 1.6%</li>
  <li>Achievable level: ≤ 1.3%</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a negative polarity standard. This means a lower percentage is better.</p>

<p>The variation in thresholds reflects that community programmes typically screen babies at a later age and therefore pass rates are higher.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S04: referral: time from screening outcome to offered appointment for diagnostic audiological assessment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The proportion of babies with a no clear response result in one or both ears or other result that require an immediate onward referral for audiological assessment who are offered an audiological assessment appointment that is within the required timescale.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To provide assurance that babies with a no clear response result in one or both ears or other result who require an immediate onward referral for audiological assessment, are referred for diagnostic audiological assessment in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of babies who receive a no clear response result in one or both ears or other result that requires an immediate onward referral for diagnostic audiological assessment who are offered an appointment that is within the required timescale.</p>

<p>Within the national IT system for newborn hearing screening a no clear response result is defined as the following screening outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr> – bilateral referral, unilateral referral</li>
  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled</li>
  <li>incomplete – screening contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<p>The required timescale is either within 4 weeks of screen completion or by 44 weeks gestational age. Corrected age is used for babies born at &lt;40 weeks gestation.</p>

<p>Denominator: number of babies who receive a no clear response result in one or both ears or other result that requires an immediate onward referral for diagnostic audiological assessment.</p>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 97.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following babies are included in the denominator but may not be offered follow-up in England and therefore are not included in the numerator. The following babies should be accounted for and the reason explained in the commentary as mitigations against performance thresholds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies who are too unwell to proceed with the test or who die between screen completion and the offer of a diagnostic audiological assessment appointment</li>
  <li>babies whose follow-up appointment is in another country</li>
</ul>

<p>The threshold was previously set at 100% and should be regarded as a structural standard defined within the service specification. However, to focus attention on this, it will be included as a programme standard until performance improves.</p>
