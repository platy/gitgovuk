<h2>
<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S01: coverage</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The proportion of babies <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#eligible">eligible</a> for newborn hearing screening for whom the screening process is complete by &lt; 4 weeks (28 days) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#corrected-age">corrected age</a> (in services which provide a hospital model – well babies) and neonatal intensive care unit (<abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr>) babies or by &lt; 5 weeks (35 days) corrected age (in services which provide a community model – well babies).</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To provide assurance that screening is offered to all eligible babies.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#numerator">Numerator</a>: number of eligible babies (for whom the offer is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#informed-choice-to-accept-screening">accepted</a>) with a conclusive screen result recorded, or a screening outcome set by &lt; 4 weeks (28 days) (hospital model) or by &lt; 5 weeks (35 days) (community model) of date of birth or corrected age if born &lt; 40 weeks gestation.</p>

<p>A screening outcome is set when one of the following outcomes is entered in to the newborn hearing screening programme (<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>) national IT system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#clear-response-cr">clear response (<abbr title="clear response">CR</abbr>)</a> – no follow-up required; targeted follow-up required</li>
  <li>no clear response (<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr>) – bilateral referral, unilateral referral</li>
  <li>incomplete – equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled, screening contraindicated</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#denominator">Denominator</a>: number of eligible babies born in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-population-screening-glossary-of-terms/glossary-of-terms#reporting-period">reporting period</a> whose mother was registered with a GP practice in the clinical commissioning group (<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>), or (if not registered with any practice) resident in the area covered by the provider <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> site or <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> area. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>well babies</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr> babies</li>
</ul>

<p>This excludes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any baby who died before screening could be completed</li>
  <li>well and <abbr title="neonatal intensive care unit">NICU</abbr> babies that have not reached 4 weeks (28 days) (hospital model) or 5 weeks (35 days) (community model) from date of birth or at the time of the report</li>
  <li>babies born in England who have had their record transferred electronically to Wales</li>
  <li>babies born in Wales who have had their record transferred electronically to England</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 98.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.5%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following babies are included in the denominator but may not be screened by the <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> and therefore are not included in the numerator. These babies should be accounted for and the reason explained in the commentary as mitigations against performance thresholds. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies who have attained the required age (described above) but whose screening was delayed because they are not well enough</li>
  <li>babies who are eligible for screening but were screened in other countries (including Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales (where their record has not been electronically transferred))</li>
  <li>babies born in US Air Force bases</li>
</ul>

<p>To provide assurance that babies who require immediate referral for audiological assessment are offered a first appointment in audiology that enables attendance in the specified timescales in line with <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S05. An offer of a first appointment should be made in clinically relevant timescales to allow for <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/newborn-hearing-screening-programme-quality-standards/newborn-hearing-screening-supporting-information">maturation of the ABR response</a>.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of babies offered a first audiological assessment appointment following a conclusive screen result at <abbr title="automated auditory brainstem response">AABR</abbr> or a screening outcome set by:</p>

<p>&lt; 4 weeks (28 days)</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>if born &lt; 40 weeks gestation by &lt; 4 weeks (28 days) corrected age</p>

<p>Denominator: number of babies born in the reporting period who have a no clear response result in one or both ears at <abbr title="automated auditory brainstem response">AABR</abbr> or other outcome that requires a referral for audiological assessment. This excludes babies who died before they could attend their audiological assessment.</p>

<p>The screening outcomes that require a diagnostic referral in the national IT system for newborn hearing screening are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="no clear response">NCR</abbr> at <abbr title="automated auditory brainstem response">AABR</abbr> – bilateral referral, unilateral referral</li>
  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled, screening contraindicated, lack of service capacity</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 97.0%</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 99.0%</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following babies are included in the denominator but may not be offered follow-up in England and therefore are not included in the numerator. These should be accounted for and the reason explained in the commentary as mitigations against performance thresholds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies who are too unwell to proceed with the test</li>
  <li>babies whose follow-up appointment is in another country</li>
</ul>

<abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr>-S05: diagnosis/intervention: time from screening outcome to attendance at an audiological assessment appointment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The proportion of babies requiring immediate referral who are brought for an audiological assessment appointment in the required timescale.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>To provide assurance that opportunities for intervention for babies who require an immediate referral for audiological assessment are maximised by attending audiology in the required timescale.</p>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>Numerator: number of babies who were brought for audiological assessment appointment following a conclusive screen result at <abbr title="automated auditory brainstem response">AABR</abbr> or a screening outcome set by:</p>

<p>&lt; 4 weeks (28 days)</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>if born &lt; 40 weeks gestation by &lt; 4 weeks (28 days) corrected age</p>

<p>Denominator: number of babies born in the reporting period who have a no clear response result in one or both ears at <abbr title="automated auditory brainstem response">AABR</abbr> or other outcome that requires a referral for audiological assessment. This excludes babies who died before they could attend their audiological assessment.</p>

<p>The screening outcomes that require a diagnostic referral in the <abbr title="newborn hearing screening programme">NHSP</abbr> national IT system are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  <li>incomplete – baby/equipment reason, equipment malfunction, equipment not available, baby unsettled, screening contraindicated, lack of service capacity</li>
</ul>

<p>We calculate performance by dividing numerator by denominator and multiplying by 100 to give a percentage.</p>

<h3>Performance thresholds</h3>

<p>Acceptable level: ≥ 90.0 %</p>

<p>Achievable level: ≥ 95.0 %</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>The following babies are included in the denominator but may not attend follow-up in England and therefore are not included in the numerator. These babies should be accounted for and the reason explained in the commentary as mitigations against performance thresholds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>babies who are too unwell to proceed with the test</li>
  <li>babies whose follow-up appointment is in another country</li>
</ul>

<p>Providers need to be able to demonstrate follow-up of those who did not attend/was not brought as per local policy.</p>
