<h2>When</h2>

<p>6am on Tuesday 28 June to half an hour after prize giving on Sunday 3 July 2022.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>Henley reach.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Those in charge of boats must conform with these directions and with any special directions which, at the discretion of the Harbour Master, may be required in particular circumstances during these dates.</p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>All boats must navigate in accordance with instructions given from Environment Agency patrol launches.</p>

<p>From 6am until half an hour after the end of racing on each of the above dates and until half an hour after the Prize Giving Ceremony on the Sunday afternoon, the navigation of all boats (except those authorised by the Environment Agency) will be restricted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manually propelled boats can navigate outside the regatta course and practice area and can, if necessary, cross the course through the openings in the booms as long as a race is not in progress.</li>
  <li>powered boats can only navigate in the navigation channel outside the regatta course and crew warm up area on the Bucks Bank/Fawley side of the river, between the control points upstream of Henley Bridge and downstream of Temple Island as long as they do not stop, loiter or turn, or otherwise impede or interfere with the Regatta or the navigation of any other boats.</li>
  <li>sailing boats can navigate only with oars as in (i) above or mechanical power as in (ii) above and must not hoist their sail(s).</li>
  <li>all boats must navigate at slow speed with extreme care and caution on the side of the navigation channel which lies on the starboard side of these boats and will give way to any racing boats proceeding to the start of the regatta course.</li>
  <li>we expect the Henley Reach to be busy during these times.  Therefore, we would like to remind river users that whilst navigating under bridges boats going upstream must give way to boats coming downstream. The headway at the highest point of Henley Bridge is 4.34 metres or 14 feet and 3 inches.  Headways are measured above standard head water level of the lock below, therefore the measurements given are for guidance only.</li>
  <li>from time-to-time information regarding navigation between Henley Bridge and The Remenham Club may be broadcast on Channel 74 Marine Band VHF.</li>
  <li>no directions contained in this notice shall supersede those parts of Byelaw 24 of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993 as may be relevant.</li>
  <li>no boats (except those authorised by the Environment Agency) are allowed to navigate or moor within the regatta course booms or crew warm up area.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mooring</h2>

<p>No mooring is allowed to any of the piles of the regatta course or boxes.</p>

<p>Boats must not be moored unattended alongside the regatta course booms.</p>

<p>Unpowered boats can moor to the towpath alongside the regatta course one abreast only and as long as no obstruction is caused.</p>

<p>Unpowered boats can moor to the booms outside the regatta course (except in the crew warm up area or in the area known as The Narrows), as long as no obstruction is caused.  (The Narrows is indicated with an X on the map below).</p>

<p>Powered boats must not moor to the towpath alongside the regatta course or crew warm up area between 6am and half an hour after racing on each day.</p>

<p>Open powered boats, i.e. those without awnings or cabins, may moor one abreast only to the regatta course booms on the Bucks Bank/Fawley side of the river, downstream of the course pile marked with a notice to this effect, as long as no obstruction is caused to the navigation channel.  Other powered boats must not moor to the regatta course booms, this applies until half an hour after the end of the Prize Giving Ceremony on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>No mooring is allowed to the banks or booms in the area between the mooring prohibition notices at The Narrows, or to the course booms from The Narrows to Temple Island.</p>

<figcaption><p>Henley Regatta Course Map</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Furthermore, we hereby advise that the regatta course including all of the piles, booms and boxes are the property of Henley Royal Regatta. The Regatta may choose to take civil action against any person who causes damage to their structures.</p>

<p>Owners and masters off all boats are reminded that it is an offence for boats to carry more than twelve passengers unless a valid maritime and coastguard agency passenger carrying certificate is shown on board.</p>

<p>It is an offence to fail to conform with the directions in this notice or to obstruct an officer of the Environment Agency in the execution of their duty or to fail to obey directions given regarding the navigation, mooring or unmooring of any boat.</p>

<p>Bathing or swimming is prohibited at any time during between Henley Bridge and the end of the crew warm up area downstream of Temple Island.</p>
