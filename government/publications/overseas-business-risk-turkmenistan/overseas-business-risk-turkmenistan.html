<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>Turkmenistan is located in a strategically important region, bordering Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.  It is bounded on the west by the Caspian Sea.  It gained independence from the USSR in 1991.  Official statistics report the population as 5.9 million, but there is evidence that it has fallen substantially in recent years as people leave to find work, and may be as low as 4 million.</p>

<p>The Karakum desert covers 80% of the country. Turkmenistan has the world’s fourth largest proven reserves of gas<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Gas export to China plays a major role in the national economy. Gas market diversification is a major government objective and recent years have seen increasing sales to Russia and signs of markets opening with Azerbaijan and Iran.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan’s current President is Serdar Berdimuhammedov, who was appointed President in March 2022, taking over from his father, Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov, who held the post from 2006 to 2022. The volume of trade with the UK in the year to June 2021 was £28m, mainly in goods. Turkmenistan’s foreign policy is centred on its status of permanent neutrality. Turkmenistan is an FCDO Human Rights Priority country.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Political</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Politics</h3>

<p>Turkmenistan became a Soviet Republic in 1924.  It gained its independence in October 1991 following the collapse of the USSR. The 2016 Constitution defines the country as a secular democracy and a presidential republic.</p>

<p>The Constitution laid down that the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government would be independent.  In October 2017, then President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov announced the introduction of a People’s Council with a wider composition and more extensive competences than its predecessor.  Its members were elected on 25 March 2018.  It must be convened not less than once a year and its decisions must be implemented by the President, the Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers and other government bodies.</p>

<p>Three political parties put forward candidates for the 2018 parliamentary elections: the Democratic Party (the successor to the Communist Party), the Agrarian Party and the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.  Independent citizens’ groups also put forward candidates.</p>

<p>All the parties supported the President, with only minor differences of emphasis.  The Democratic Party won 54 seats, the Agrarian Party 11 seats, the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs 11 seats and independent citizens’ group candidates the remaining 49 seats.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Government of Turkmenistan announced its decision to switch to a bicameral system of parliament and it passed a decree amending the Constitution.</p>

<p>The bicameral parliamentary system came into effect on 1 January 2021. The Milli Gengesh (National Council) of Turkmenistan now comprises two chambers: the Halk Maslahaty (upper chamber) and the Mejlis (lower chamber).</p>

<p>The 56 members of the Halk Maslahaty comprise of eight representatives from each of the five provinces and Ashgabat plus eight representatives appointed directly by the President. Upon stepping down from the office of president in March 2022, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov remained Chairman of the Halk Maslahaty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>The President</h3>

<p>On 11 February 2022, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov called a snap election for 12 March 2022. Serdar Berdimuhamedov, his son, was elected President on 19 March 2022. He was declared winner with 72.97 % of the vote from a turnout of 97.12%.</p>

<p>The OSCE’s Office for Democracy Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) did not observe the 2022 election. An assessment mission expressed concern that none of ODIHR’s previous recommendations on the conduct of elections had been implemented and that quarantine requirements imposed on ODIHR observers would prevent them from carrying out their mission. It therefore judged that election observation activity was not feasible. Observation missions from the Commonwealth of Independent States, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Turkic Council were assisted by the authorities to visit selected polling stations and expressed satisfaction with the election process.</p>

<p>The President is Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and responsible for senior appointments in government, the judiciary and the major organs of state and religion.</p>

<p>The previous President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov was appointed acting President in December 2006 following the death of the country’s first president, Saparmurat Niyazov. He was confirmed in office following elections in early 2007 and again in 2012.  He was re-elected for a third term in February 2017 with 97.7% of the vote.   ODIHR noted in their 2017 observation report that the elections took place in a heavily controlled political environment and that a lack of genuine opposition or meaningful pluralism limited voters’ choice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Development</h3>

<p>Turkmenistan collaborates with the United Nations under the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework that will guide development until 2025.  The EU, the OSCE and individual countries, including the US and the UK, also run limited in-country development programmes. Turkmenistan has prepared a 30-year plan that sees it becoming a regional transport and energy hub.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Foreign policy</h3>

<p>Turkmenistan attaches great importance to its policy of permanent neutrality, a status recognised in a United Nations General Assembly Resolution adopted in December 1995.  In 2022 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Turkmenistan’s foreign policy priorities as five-fold: to ensure regional security and stability; to promote neutrality in the international arena; to diversify Turkmen foreign economic relations; to promote stable development; and to work for ‘humanisation’ of international relations. In this last respect, it noted the importance of promoting human rights to food, water, health, education and light.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan’s major international trading partner is China.  Turkey is the next most significant, underpinned by historical, cultural, commercial, economic and political ties. Relations with Russia are important. Turkmenistan’s presidents have sought to embed a sense of single nationhood among the different Turkmen tribes, in many cases at the expense of other ethnicities, including Russians and Uzbeks.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan cannot ignore Russia’s political weight and Russia still regards Turkmenistan as within its legitimate sphere of interest.  President Putin last visited Ashgabat in October 2019.  Foreign Minister Meredov paid a visit to Moscow two days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 25 February 2022. Turkmenistan did not vote on the UN General Assembly Resolution on 2 March 2022 calling for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine nor on the UN General Assembly Resolution of 24 March 2022 on the humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan shares 462 miles of border with Afghanistan.  Some one million ethnic Turkmen live in Afghanistan along its borders with Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Relations with Afghanistan are generally good. Turkmenistan has played a small but positive role in its development and reconstruction, delivering humanitarian aid and supplying Afghanistan with cheap electricity, gas and oil. Taleban diplomats took charge of the Afghan Embassy in Ashgabat in early 2022.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan also shares 621 miles of border with Iran.  There are at least one million ethnic Turkmen living in Iran, mostly in the border region of Turkmen Sahra.</p>

<p>The EU’s engagement in the region is governed by its Strategy for Central Asia. This supports peaceful, prosperous, sustainable and stable development and the promotion of good governance, human rights and the rule of law.</p>

<p>Relations with the United Kingdom focus on climate change, the green economy, gender equality, education, regional security and human rights.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Economy</h2>

<p>No reliable economic data are published in Turkmenistan.  Most sources cite figures that the government releases to international financial institutions. These do not always square with observation on the ground. Turkmenistan’s economy is based on the sale of gas and (some) oil. China is the main market for Turkmen gas. Turkmenistan exports some cotton, yarn, textiles and processed food.</p>

<p>The volume of trade with the UK declined from £123m in 2011 to £28m in 2021. The balance of trade is significantly in the UK’s favour. Trade in goods far exceeds trade in services.</p>

<p>The recommendations of the latest IMF mission to Ashgabat in 2019 remain relevant. The IMF noted that economic growth had slowed because of lower public investment and stringent exchange controls, which had reduced both demand and imports.  This, and rising hydrocarbon prices, had resulted in a balance of trade surplus but the economic outlook was uncertain because of the disequilibrium between the official and non-official exchange rates.  The mission made a number of recommendations, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhancing competitiveness and improving currency convertibility in order to achieve development goals without recreating a trade deficit, but sequencing changes and taking steps to protect the vulnerable</li>
  <li>accelerating moves towards a market-based economy, including privatising state-owned enterprises, promoting competition, enhancing the rule of law and reducing red tape</li>
  <li>phasing out import substitution policies to make exports more competitive and help diversify the economy</li>
  <li>greater transparency and better economic statistics to attract private foreign and domestic investment</li>
  <li>better regulation and supervision of the banking sector to preserve financial stability and integrity</li>
  <li>improved access to internet and greater use of digital technologies</li>
  <li>better policy frameworks, including for management of public finances, debt, and investment</li>
  <li>building human capital, in particular improving the education and health systems</li>
</ul>

<p>The economic effects of sanctions imposed by the international community on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 are likely to be felt in Turkmenistan but given the dominance of China in the economy and the growing relationship with Turkey, the effects of the sanctions may be felt less than in other countries in the region.</p>

<p>Official statistics about the effect of the pandemic on the economy are not released. However, prolonged lockdowns and a stringent quarantine regime for all arrivals have affected large and small businesses alike and had a profound impact on many ordinary workers, especially in the hospitality sector. The Government of Turkmenistan has not acknowledged any cases of Covid-19 on its territory.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Energy sector</h3>

<p>Turkmenistan has the world’s fourth largest proven reserves of natural gas, 13.6 trillion cubic metres or 7.2% of the world’s total<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. It has the world’s second largest single deposit in the Galkynysh field in the south east of the country. In 2020, it produced 59 billion cubic metres of gas, of which about 31 billion cubic metres were consumed internally, mainly for power generation, chemical production and residential use. Much of the remainder was exported to China.</p>

<p>In 2019, the State Concern Turkmengaz signed a 5-year contract with Russia’s Gazprom for the supply of up to 5.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year. Exact offtake figures have not been released, but are believed to be in the region of 3 to 4 billion cubic metres.</p>

<p>In late 2021, the Government agreed a gas swap deal of an annual amount of 1.5 to 2 billion cubic metres with Iran and Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>Potentially, Turkmenistan’s gas reserves could provide an additional 30 billion cubic metres annually for the proposed Southern Gas Corridor (a project to bring gas to Europe through Turkey from Azerbaijan initially and possibly from Iran and/or Turkmenistan in the longer term).  Moves over the last few years to build a Trans-Caspian pipeline to bring gas from Turkmenistan to Europe have faltered in the absence of progress on discussions and due to geopolitical considerations across the region. However, following more than two decades of negotiations, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan signed the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea in August 2018. Iran remains the only littoral state to ratify the agreement.</p>

<p>Launched in 1995, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline project (TAPI) was developed to provide an alternative route for Turkmen gas.  A preliminary engineering feasibility study has been completed and the project remains a high priority for the Government.   The progress of securing financial support is slow, partly because of security concerns in Afghanistan and partly because of the reluctance on the part of Turkmenistan to allow foreign companies to take an equity share in on-shore production facilities.</p>

<p>In January 2021, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan signed a Memorandum of Understanding on joint development of a previously disputed offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>The energy sector is the main driver of the economy and is of commercial interest to both international energy companies and the service and supply chain. To date however many have been deterred from entering the market because of the difficult business environment (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#BB">British Business section</a> below) and because the terms proposed do not offer the security they need for the scale of investment required.</p>

<p>The Government of Turkmenistan has in recent times made statements about its intent to develop a renewable energy sector. Turkmenistan has significant solar and wind potential. Discussions about a hydrogen sector are at an early stage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>British business</h3>

<p>There are challenges to doing business in Turkmenistan. Decision-making is centralised at the highest level, particularly if a project has foreign involvement. This reflects poor experience in the years after independence and a heightened concern to prevent foreign influence. The law does not adequately protect contracts and can be changed by decree or ignored with impunity by vested interests. Both domestic and foreign businesses can be forced out of the market for specious, or undisclosed, reasons.  It can be difficult to obtain payment for goods and to remit in-country profits, exacerbated by lack of foreign reserves. Foreign exchange accounts and international transfers require state approval.</p>

<p>There remain opportunities however.  UK companies are advised to consult the Department for International Trade for advice to focus on sectors where Turkmenistan is investing and to work through a trusted local partner to manage bureaucratic and political hurdles. It is advisable to obtain payment for goods and services in advance, splitting larger projects into tranches for this purpose. Those who are successful have built up relations over many years, and, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Turkmen society, been prepared to engage at the most senior level in business negotiations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Visas</h3>

<p>Obtaining a business visa requires a letter of invitation from a counterpart in Turkmenistan, making it difficult to pay an exploratory visit to assess business opportunities. One option is to sign up for a conference or exhibition held in-country for which visas are more easily available. However, since the pandemic, such conferences and exhibitions are still rare or held online.</p>

<p>Nationals from conflict regions, including the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, face considerable difficulties in securing visas.</p>

<p>Since March 2020, measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 mean that entry to Turkmenistan has become even more restricted.  There are no scheduled flights into or out of the country.  Anyone who does arrive faces up to three weeks in quarantine in a state facility.  Exceptions to these restrictions are rare.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>International business practices</h3>

<p>Banking facilities are underdeveloped and banks cannot yet provide many basic services.  ATMs are not widespread and often run out of money.  Most visitors bring US dollars in cash, as other currencies are difficult to exchange.  Few places accept bank or credit cards. The best-known foreign bank is the Turkmen Turkish Commercial Bank, part of the Ziraat Bank group.  There is a large divergence between official and unofficial exchange rates. Strict controls and harsh penalties are applied to those who are caught breaking currency exchange regulations.</p>

<p>The UK/Turkmenistan Double Taxation Convention entered into force on 19 December 2016.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Communications</h3>

<p>Access to the internet is limited, and most social media is blocked (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#BHR">Business and Human Rights</a> section below). Most roaming services are blocked. The sole mobile phone service provider is state owned.</p>

<p>Although it is against the law, VPNs are widely used in Turkmenistan but with continuous difficulties and blockages.</p>

<p>It is not possible to buy international newspapers or other foreign publications in Turkmenistan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>Turkmenistan is a UK Human Rights Priority Country. Although it is a signatory to most of the international human rights instruments and its national legislation contains provisions for the protection of basic human rights, implementation remains problematic. Civil liberties and freedom of expression are severely curtailed. Freedom House consistently place Turkmenistan at the bottom of their global freedom rankings.  Human rights activists work only outside the country. They make credible claims of torture and abuse in prisons.</p>

<p>The Government controls the media.  In 2021, Reporters without Borders ranked Turkmenistan 178th of the 180 countries it covers. Only 17% of the population have Internet access (Internet World Stats 2019) and many sites are blocked.  Almost all social media, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, are similarly blocked.</p>

<p>The Government of Turkmenistan participates in the OSCE Human Dimension meetings and in the UN Universal Periodic Review system.  The Government’s National Human Rights Action Plan was launched in 2016 and updated in 2021. The Constitution contains human rights provisions, including for an independent human rights ombudsman.  The gap between legislation and implementation nevertheless remains wide and the lack of government transparency makes monitoring difficult.</p>

<p>The British Embassy in Ashgabat engages with the Government of Turkmenistan on human rights issues in particular in the fields of justice, good governance, the rights of women and girls, freedom of expression, religion and belief and the use of forced labour.  The Embassy works in partnership with the UN to fund projects on gender sensitivity.   Further material on human rights can be found in the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-rights-and-democracy-report-2020/human-rights-and-democracy-2020-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-report">FCDO Human Rights Report</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or anyone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership to solicit or accept or offer a bribe anywhere in the world. In addition, any commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable under UK legislation for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national nor resident in the UK nor a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In these circumstances, it does not matter whether the acts or omissions that form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 2021 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, which measures perceived levels of corruption, ranked Turkmenistan 169 out of 180 countries, four places lower than in 2020.</p>

<p>We have no reports of UK companies being asked to be complicit in corrupt practices, but there have been reports of agents or intermediaries seeking facilitation payments and of Turkmen organisations seeking to have their expenses met to pursue business in the UK.</p>

<p>A number of pieces of legislation regulate the protection of intellectual property in Turkmenistan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scientific Intellectual Property (1992)</li>
  <li>Legal Protection of Algorithms, Software, Databases, and IC Devices (1994)</li>
  <li>Inventions and Industrial Designs (2008)</li>
  <li>Trade and Service Marks and Places of Origin (2008)</li>
  <li>Copyright and Allied Rights (2012)</li>
  <li>Innovation (2014)</li>
  <li>Ownership (2015)</li>
  <li>Legal Protection of Inventions (2017)</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies doing business in Turkmenistan are advised to take legal advice locally to ensure that their rights are protected under the appropriate provisions of these, and that contracts include non-competition clauses and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Turkmenistan and the State Agency for Intellectual Property Protection can also provide advice.</p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Organised crime</h2>

<p>Turkmenistan is neither a producer nor a source country for illegal drugs or precursor chemicals. It is however positioned along the western and northern routes for Afghan opiates travelling to Europe and Russia and is believed to be one of the main conduits for this traffic.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan acceded to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1972 Protocol amending it, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The government has brought national laws and regulations in the field of drug control into conformity with these.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan is also a member of the regional mini-Dublin Group (The Dublin Group was established in 1990, under the auspices of the European Committee to Combat Drugs, to analyse and exchange information, make recommendations and co-ordinate action on the production and trafficking of illegal drugs).</p>
