<p>‘Because of my condition, I asked to be allowed to bring my fidget cube and ear defenders into the interview and problem test, just in case the room it was held in was auditorily overstimulating. This request was met, and it helped me through the interview process.’</p>

<p>Neil, Human Resources</p>

<h2>Do you need assistance?</h2>

<p>We want to create an inclusive and respectful environment, and a workforce that fully reflects the diversity and values of our society.

<p>Everyone’s needs are different, and any requests will be reviewed discreetly and treated on a case by case basis, taking into consideration your own unique personal circumstances and the facts provided. Anything you tell us will not affect how your application proceeds.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘In high pressure situations, I stim to help calm myself. Stims are repetitive physical actions, for example, flapping my hand, clicking my fingers, or rocking. I asked for the panel to be made aware in advance that this might happen, and they were completely understanding.’</p>

<p>Molly, HMRC Customer Strategy and Tax Design</p>

<h2>How we can help</h2>

<p>The information provided below is not definitive or exhaustive. We understand that there is no ‘one size fits all’ and all adjustments will be unique to the individual. These are just some examples of assistance we have provided during recruitment selection and any request for adjustments will be considered on its own merits.</p>

<h3>Application stage</h3>

<p>Some people may require that any printed material is provided in Braille or audio format.</p>

<h3>Online tests</h3>

<p>Some on-line test questions are presented as videos. Some people may not be able to access these, so alternative written transcripts are available within the test. There are also subtitles within the videos, and audio description which describes the video setting. There are  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reasonable-adjustments-for-online-tests-a-candidate-guide">other adjustments that can be considered here</a>.</p>

<h3>Pre-recorded interviews</h3>

<p>Some of our interviews are pre-recorded, with a set time for a response. You can ask for extra time, if for example you have a speech impediment, to allow you additional time to respond. For some people with neuro-diverse conditions, pre-recorded interviews may not be the best approach. In these situations, an alternative interview approach could be considered, this could be a virtual interview via Teams or face-to-face, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt=" " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/127447/8830_960x640_03-re.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>Virtual or face-to-face live interviews</h3>

<p>You may need discuss scheduling breaks during your interview if you have epilepsy. For individuals that use support, such as a British Sign Language interpreter or lip-speaker, you can request extra time to answer each question.</p>

<p>If you have a neuro-diverse condition, we can consider providing the interview questions shortly before your interview starts. If the interview is being held in one of our offices, you can request a pre-visit to the interview book to familiarise yourself with the space and identify any adjustments you may need to manage heightened sensitivities relating to light, noise and layout.</p>

<h3>We’re here to help support you</h3>

<p>We would like to make sure you understand that as a candidate you don’t have any obligation at all to give <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> any information regarding your health. It is up to you and you only to decide if and at what point you disclose your health condition or disability if you have one. However, we can only make adjustments where we know about them and based on the information you give us.</p>

<p>You may have already ticked the assistance required box in your application form, so will already be communicating with our recruitment provider (Government Recruitment Services) about adjustment requests.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt=" " src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/127448/8830_960x640_04-re.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>If you have forgotten to tick the box, or in retrospect now feel that you may require an adjustment, don’t worry – it’s not too late to request one. You can let us know by emailing the address shown in the ‘Contact point for applicants’ section of the advert, to discuss any requests you have.</p>

<p>Any information you provide will be held in strict confidence and will not affect your progression through the application/decision process in any way.</p>

<p>We recommend that you keep a copy of the job advert for your records. When the advert closes it is no longer available to view on the system.</p>

<p>‘As an autistic person, I can find eye contact uncomfortable, so might not look directly at people. My own body language and facial expression might not represent accurately what I am thinking and feeling, and I was worried about this.</p>

<p>‘I let HMRC know before my interview and the panel were helpful and friendly throughout. I also agreed with the vacancy holder that I could have sight of the interview questions slightly before the interview, which meant I was more confident and focused, so could better demonstrate my suitability for the role.’</p>
