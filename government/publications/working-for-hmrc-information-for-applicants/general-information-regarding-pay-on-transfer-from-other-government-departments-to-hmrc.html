<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will pay from the first day in the post. Exporting departments will pay the employee until the date of transfer; if this falls on a Friday the exporting department should pay until the Sunday. Employees should not start their new role in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> until the payroll transfer is confirmed and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> are in a position to pay the individual.</p>

<h2>Basic pay</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has 2 pay range locations for each grade: London and National. Each grade’s pay range has a minimum and maximum rate, without any “spine points”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the exception of London Weighting (or equivalent), allowances are not transferrable to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and all other allowances are lost on transfer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Level moves (voluntary)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If your department currently pays you on its National pay range, your basic pay, excluding any specialist payments or allowances, will move across to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s appropriate National pay range for your grade. If this falls below <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s National pay range minimum for your grade it will be uplifted to the minimum for your grade. However, if this is above the maximum, it will be capped at <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s maximum for your grade.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your department currently pays you on its London pay range, your basic pay, excluding any specialist payments or allowances, will move across to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s London pay range for your grade. However, if you are in receipt of a London Weighting allowance or equivalent, this amount will be consolidated into your basic pay before being moved across to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s London pay range (paragraph 3 outlines how any uplifts or capping will be done).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your basic pay (including London weighting but excluding any specialist payments or allowances) is greater than the equivalent <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> grade range maximum. Any value above <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s maximum may be retained on a Mark Time basis and will be eroded by any future basic pay increases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your move to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> involves a change in pay location into or out of the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> London pay area, your basic pay in your current department will be transferred across to the equivalent <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pay range for that location (as explained paragraph 3 and 4). Your pay will then be moved to the equivalent pay rate for the new location. Please refer to the Equivalent Position calculation below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some departments have offices where the boundaries do not align with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s National / London pay boundaries. The process outlined in the Equivalent Position calculation below of moving your basic pay to the equivalent position for the correct <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> location will be carried out after moving your present pay to an aligning <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> office classification. For example, your office in your current department may be classified as London but is regarded as National within <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>. Your basic pay will be transferred to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s London range before moving across to the equivalent position on <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s National pay range.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are moving from a London area within your current department to a National area in <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, there is a possibility of a decrease in pay.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Equivalent position calculation</h2>

<p>The equivalent position calculation is used when moving between National and London pay ranges. It maintains the relative position of your basic pay in the pay range, on transfer to the new pay area.</p>

<h3>Equivalent position formula:</h3>

<p>((A / B) x C) + D = New basic pay on move, where:</p>

<p>A = New pay range maximum minus new pay range minimum<br>
B = Old pay range maximum minus old pay range minimum<br>
C = Current basic pay minus old pay range minimum<br>
D = New pay range minimum</p>

<h2>Specialist pay</h2>

<p>If you are on a specialist pay range due to your role in your current department, your pay will be adjusted to the equivalent generalist pay range position for your location in your current department using the above processes.</p>

<h2>Promotion moves to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Your current basic pay will be moved across to the equivalent pre-promotion <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> grade pay range following the processes outlined above. If your pre-promotion salary exceeds <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s pay range maximum, your pay will be capped at our maximum. You will then receive the better of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an uplift of 10% of this basic pay, capped at the <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pay range maximum</li>
  <li>the minimum of <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s pay range for the grade you have been promoted to</li>
</ul>

<p>You should note that your pay on promotion may be less than 10%, if for example you are currently paid from a higher specialist pay range which is higher than <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s pay ranges which are generalist. This is because basic pay will be capped at <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s pay range maximum.</p>

<h2>Basic Pay Award (from 2019)</h2>

<p>Transfers will receive the pay award according to the matrix below where appropriate. Depending on the exact date of your transfer to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>, you may be eligible for either <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s or your exporting department’s pay awards.</p>

<p>This will exclude any increases for pay restructuring or contractual buy-out by your old department. If details cannot be obtained and you meet all other Pay Award Criteria, you will receive <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s award.</p>

<p>Any award will be paid from 1 June or your take up duty date (with backdating if required), whichever is later.</p>
