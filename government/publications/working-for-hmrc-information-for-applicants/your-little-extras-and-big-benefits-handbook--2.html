<h2>A great place to work</h2>

<p>We believe that <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> is a great place to work and know that a good work life balance is important for us all. We want to ensure your well-being is provided for, alongside the opportunity for a long, happy and rewarding career. This has led to a huge number of our employees staying with us for many years and have actively used, been rewarded or taken part in many of the benefits, extras and memberships we tell you about in this handbook.</p>

<p>When you join us you also join a friendly and helpful community. We’ll give you the support you need to grow in confidence, help you enjoy your time inside and outside the work place and as your life changes, there will be things in this book that may come in handy if the need arises.</p>

<p>So whether you want to map out your career progression and aim even higher, manage your own wellbeing better, or work in a positive and inclusive environment, we are here to support you. Below is a great rundown of all the benefits and schemes that are open or available to you once you join us. Read on to find out more as we think you’ll be surprised at just what we can offer you here at <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Time off and flexible working</h2>

<h3>Annual and privilege leave</h3>

<p>When you join us, you’ll get 25 days annual leave in your first year. After that, for each year of service you will get one additional days leave up to a maximum of 30 days. For example, if you are with us for three years you’ll get 28 days annual leave in your third year. As an added bonus we’ll also give you an extra privilege day off for the Queen’s birthday.</p>

<h3>Working from home</h3>

<p>We recognise the work-life benefits when you’re able to work flexibly from different locations. We want to support as many people as possible to work from home. So, if your personal circumstances, role and work are suitable you will have the opportunity to work from home for two days a week, or more where the business agrees.</p>

<h3>Alternative and flexible working patterns</h3>

<p>To help support a good work-life balance, we offer flexible working where and when possible. This will vary dependant on the business area you work in and the business need. This could include various start/finish times and flexible lunch breaks. We’ll also consider requests for alternative working patterns such as part-time working (including job sharing, job splitting, Term Time and partial retirement).</p>

<h3>Maternity, paternity, adoption and parental leave</h3>

<p>For new parents and soon to be parents, we offer maternity and adoption pay of 26 weeks at your normal rate of pay, followed by a further 13 weeks at the statutory rate depending on the length of your continuous service. You can also take another 13 weeks unpaid maternity/adoption leave. Eligible employees will be entitled to claim ‘Shared Parental Leave’ of up to 39 weeks within one year from the birth or placement. For paternity leave, we give four weeks paid leave. In addition, we offer up to 18 weeks unpaid parental leave, although no more than four weeks each year, until your child reaches their 10th birthday (18 if registered disabled).</p>

<h3>Special paid/unpaid leave</h3>

<p>We all have to deal with unforeseen circumstances, medical appointments and emergencies. In some circumstances there is a statutory right to time off, for instance, to carry out certain public duties or for emergencies involving dependants. In these cases a reasonable amount of time off must be granted. In some cases time off is discretionary and subject to business need, however your manager will be able to advise you on your leave options.</p>

<h2>Money matters</h2>

<h3>Civil Service Pension Scheme</h3>

<p>For some of our people, pension age may be a long way off, but whatever stage of life when your career starts with us, we want to help you plan for this. When you join us you will be automatically enrolled into the Civil Service Pension Scheme, if you are not already. This means whilst you have to contribute, our additional employer contribution will help your retirement be more comfortable when your time comes, compared to some pensions in the private sector. You can find out more at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.civilservicepensionscheme.org.uk" rel="external">Civil Service Pension Scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Advance of salary</h3>

<p>We acknowledge that there are times where you have to pay out a significant amount of money to be in work. For some of these circumstances we have an ‘Advance of Salary’ scheme that covers things such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cost of travel season tickets</li>
  <li>car parking permits</li>
  <li>bicycle purchase</li>
  <li>childcare costs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Free financial advice</h3>

<p>We know that financial circumstances can be confusing and cause unnecessary worry at times. That’s why our people all have free access to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://moneyandpensionsservice.org.uk" rel="external">‘Money and Pensions Service’ (MaPS)</a>. Set up by the government, they provide free and impartial money advice, guides to help improve your finances, with tools and calculators to help keep track and plan ahead. This support is available over the phone and can also be accessed online.</p>

<h2>Your career starts here</h2>

<h3>Developing your career path</h3>

<p>We believe that everyone is talented. Our aim is to embrace and celebrate the diversity and skills of all our people. We’ll provide opportunities for you to perform at the best of your ability. Our Civil Service Learning portal offers a gateway to a vast range of learning and development tools, including professional upskilling leading to recognised qualifications in a wide range of professions including HR, management, communications, project management, and operational delivery.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘It’s great that there are vast opportunities for career progression all over the country, and in many different professions.’</p>

<p>Richard, Head of Resource and Delivery for HR Operations</p>
</div>

<h3>Development opportunities</h3>

<p>We want to release and encourage the potential inside everyone, and there is support, help and programmes designed to assist you in your development and career across the Civil Service, this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>everyone gets a minimum of five formal days learning and development; provided through online, face to face or coaching</li>
  <li>covering a range of learning: profession-specific, soft skills, technical skills</li>
  <li>we also have specific targeted development programmes for colleagues looking to progress to the next grade and targeted programmes to help Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues reach senior roles</li>
  <li>approved volunteering, with up to five days paid special leave</li>
</ul>

<h3>Access to more job opportunities</h3>

<p>When you start with us you will have access to apply for <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> job vacancies that are not available externally. You will also have access to job vacancies that are only advertised across government departments.</p>

<h3>Apprenticeships</h3>

<p>We can offer employees of any age an opportunity to ‘learn while you earn’ with an <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> apprenticeship. In some instances, vacancies are advertised as apprenticeship roles and with these you’ll be an apprentice from day one. We also offer opportunities for others to apply for an apprenticeship at a later date in their employment. Whilst you are in a job role, we will also pay apprentices the same as others in the same grade.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>‘As apprentices we get a lot of exposure, like training and extra courses. You’re able to see the different routes that you could go into, or you can completely change departments. There’s so many ways you can progress.’</p>

<p>Annalise, Fast Track Apprentice.</p>

<h2>Health, wellbeing and you time</h2>

<h3>Free Employee Assistance Programme</h3>

<p>When you start, you’ll have access to free, independent, confidential, support services provided by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pamgroup.co.uk" rel="external">People Asset Management Group</a>. They provide 24hr support, 365 days a year, where you can get clinical and professional expertise covering a wide range of topics such as work, family and personal issues.</p>

There are several packages designed to meet different needs, budgets and lifestyles, giving you fast access to the best medical treatment should the need arise.</p>

<h3>Free eyesight testing</h3>

<p>Look after your eyes. Eye care is important so that’s why we offer free eye testing for all our employees, which is a particular concern for employees that use a computer screen or similar over long periods when at work.</p>

<h3>Mental health awareness</h3>

<p>We understand mental health can be affected at any point in your life. Our employees can join the Mental Health Network (<abbr title="Mental Health Network">MHN</abbr>) which is a colleague-led group with the aim of reducing stigma around mental health. So whether you personally struggle with mental health, have experience through a family member, friend or colleague or would just like to learn more to support others <abbr title="Mental Health Network">MHN</abbr> can help.</p>

<h3>Sports and leisure</h3>

<p>We want everyone to have access to sports, leisure activities and days out. Even a small amount of activity can make a real difference to your wellbeing. For a small fee, you can join <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cssc.co.uk" rel="external">Civil Service Sports Council’s (<abbr title="Civil Service Sports Council">CSSC</abbr>)</a>, Sports and Leisure giving access to a wide range of activities, discounts and free offers for members.

<h2>Diverse, inclusive and equal</h2>

<h3>Staff Diversity</h3>

<p>We want everyone to feel valued, supported, and be their true self at work. To help achieve this we have several Staff Diversity Networks that cover Race, Gender, Disability, LGBT+, Carers, Social Mobility and EU Nationals. We also have a consultation group for Age and an advisory group for Religion or belief. You can join any of these Networks when you start with us, and getting involved is easy.</p>

<h3>The Race Network</h3>

<p>We’re here for all our colleagues who have a passion for equality, diversity and inclusion. We’re helping build an organisation that represents the diverse communities we serve. We do this by promoting effective policies and raising awareness of race issues. And we work with colleagues to give them the tools and confidence they need to fulfil their aspirations and potential.</p>

<h3>LGBT+ network</h3>

<p>We offer support and consultation for our people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans or describe themselves as non-binary or form part of the wide gender spectrum. We provide advice, help and support to anyone in the organisation, not just the LGBT+ community. We warmly welcome anyone that has an interest in playing an active role in helping create an inclusive and diverse employer, one where everyone is encouraged to be themselves.</p>

<h3>Disability equality</h3>

<p>We offer an inclusive work environment for everyone. We aim to make sure that people with disabilities have access to the same opportunities as others to develop full and rewarding careers. Some services we provide include:</p>

<p>We have been recognised as a leader across the Civil Service in this field. We celebrate and welcome people from all walks of life and backgrounds to apply for our roles. Also, we run a STRIDE mentoring programme which addresses the link between socio-economic background and career progression to ensure that everyone has the same opportunities for learning and progression.</p>
