<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Implications for plant health controls on importing and exporting wood, wood products, isolated bark when the transition period ends on 31 December 2020.</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>The UK has left the European Union (EU), and the Transition Period after Brexit comes to an end on 31 December 2020. From 1 January 2021, changes to legislation will be required to enable retained EU law to operate effectively and to address other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.</p>

<p>This newsletter explains how the requirements for the import, export and movement of wood, wood products and bark from the EU will change from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>Full details of the changes can be found in the following legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukdsi/2020/9780348213775" rel="external">The Plant Health (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020: </a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukdsi/2020/9780348213706" rel="external">The Plant Health (Phytosanitary Conditions) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020:</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Section 1: Changes to Plant Health Regulations affecting controlled forestry material from 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>There will be new requirements for the import of wood, wood products and bark from the EU. Certain types of firewood, which are currently subject to statutory notification, will become controlled material. An exhaustive list of high priority goods can be found on gov.uk.</p>

<p>High priority conifer wood, wood products and bark imported from the EU for physical checks (including firewood):</p>

<ul>
  <li>All sawn conifer timber and isolated bark from EU countries with pinewood nematode (Portugal and Spain) will need to be heat-treated and require import Phytosanitary Certificates (PCs).</li>
  <li>All sawn conifer timber with bark, cut trees &gt;3m and isolated bark from all other EU countries will require import PCs that meet the landing requirements for bark beetles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Imports of sawn conifer timber, which is bark free, will still be permitted without PCs (unless it is from Portugal or Spain). It is recommended that any accompanying commercial documentation carries the statement that the product is free from bark (not de-barked). Associated dunnage (bearers, stickers and spacers) of the same type and quality of this bark-free material need not be ISPM15 compliant where it is banded together with the sawn timber product.</p>

<p>High priority hardwood and hardwood products imported from the EU for physical checks (including firewood):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plant passports will be replaced with import PCs for Castanea (unless free from bark) and Platanus.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other regulated hardwood and hardwood products imported from the EU (including firewood):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wood of Juglans (walnut) and Pterocarya (wingnut).</li>
  <li>There will be a new requirement for PCs from EU countries where Asian longhorn beetle (ALB) and the Red-necked longhorn beetle (RNLB) are present, this will apply to a wide host range of timbers but not to oak:
    <ul>
      <li>For RNLB wood of Prunus will require PCs from Italy and Germany.</li>
      <li>For ALB wood of Acer, Aesculus, Alnus, Betula, Carpinus, Cercidiphyllum, Corylus spp., Fagus, Fraxinus, Koelreuteria, Medikus, Platanus, Populus, Salix, Tilia and Ulmus will require PCs from Italy, Germany, Austria, France, Finland and Switzerland.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Conifer wood, wood products and bark exports to the EU (including firewood)</p>

<ul>
  <li>All conifer timber with bark, cut trees &gt;3m and isolated bark moving to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland will need to meet the landing requirements for conifer bark beetles:</li>
  <li>wood must:
    <ul>
      <li>be bark-free; or</li>
      <li>originate in a pest-free area (the only GB PFA being the west of Scotland PFA); or</li>
      <li>be kiln-dried and evidenced as such by a mark such as ‘KD’</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Isolated bark must be accompanied by:
    <ul>
      <li>an official statement that it has been subjected to fumigation or other appropriate treatments (approved by the Forestry Commission) against bark beetles; or</li>
      <li>that it originates in a pest-free area (the only GB PFA is the west of Scotland PFA)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>cut trees &gt;3m must come from a pest-free area</li>
</ul>

<h4>Forestry machinery and vehicles</h4>

<p>For EU imports of used forestry machinery and vehicles imported from the EU (excluding chainsaws), PCs will be required stating that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>machinery and vehicles are moved from an area free from Ceratocystis platini; or</li>
  <li>that machinery and vehicles have been cleaned and are free from soil and plant debris prior to movement out of an infected area.</li>
</ul>

<p>For used forestry machinery and vehicles exported to the EU (excluding chainsaws):</p>

<ul>
  <li>PCs will be required stating that:
    <ul>
      <li>machinery and vehicles are cleaned and free from soil and plant debris.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There will be no requirements for movement controls within Great Britain</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wood Packaging Material (WPM)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ISPM15 compliant WPM will become a requirement for the movement of all WPM between GB and the EU.</li>
  <li>This is in line with international requirements for trade and is in place to protect both the EU and GB from harmful plant pests and diseases.</li>
  <li>The WPM sector has been working with Defra and the Forestry Commission to ensure that sufficient stocks of ISPM15 material are available.</li>
  <li>As there will be no immediate change to the biosecurity threat of WPM originating from the EU at the end of the Transition Period, GB will maintain its current risk-based checking regime for EU wood packaging material.</li>
  <li>ISPM15 compliant WPM will become a requirement for all WPM moving from GB to Northern Ireland.</li>
  <li>WPM moving from Northern Ireland to GB, Northern Ireland to Republic of Ireland, or Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland does not need to be compliant with ISPM 15.</li>
</ul>

<p>A detailed Q&amp;A document for WPM is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/assets/uploads/WPM-QA-v2-final.pdf" rel="external">Plant Health Portal</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Section 2: Changes to operational process and procedures from 1 January 2021</h3>

<h4>Import Phytosanitary Certificates</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Phytosanitary certificates (PCs) issued by Plant Health Authorities in EU member states will replace EU plant passports (issued by authorised Professional Operators) for the import of goods outlined in section 1 from the EU and landing in GB on or after 1 January 2021.</li>
  <li>On entry to GB, documentary import checks will be required on PCs.  Physical checks on the material may also be carried out, according to the risk-based priority for the commodity concerned.</li>
  <li>Checks may be carried out inland at Places of Destination (PoD) until July 2021 for EU origin material. If appropriate, physical checks may also take place at Border Control Posts (BCPs).</li>
  <li>No import fees will apply to imported EU material before 1 April 2021 but Certificate of Clearance forms (PHF28s)/Quarantine Release Certificates (QRCs) will be issued to importers by Forestry Commission Inspectors.</li>
  <li>There will be no change to the operational processes for importing into GB from non-EU third countries, for example pre-notification will continue to be required and checks will still be carried out at BCPs.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you need do to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Importers will need to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=6SXFBeT5okyMVeR0AnLDvIanuLidfFdBsPbzaC6GQc9UN0hWREVEMTdXQTZZMDdGUU1YRkVKQ01JVy4u" rel="external">register with the Forestry Commission</a> as a professional operator.</li>
  <li>Once registered importers will need to pre-notify the arrival of consignments of controlled material from the EU using the FC <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-landing-form">notification of landing form</a>.</li>
  <li>For the period 1 January 2021 until 1 July 2021, checks may be carried out inland at Places of Destination rather than at Border Control Posts. You will need to include this information on the Notification of Landing form.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Import checks and Places of Destination</h4>

<p>Great Britain has developed a 3 staged phased import regime for plants and plant products including wood, wood products and isolated bark from the EU to allow importers time to adjust to the new regime and to reduce the risk of delays at the border. This is most relevant to the movement of perishable goods entering via road transport across the Channel. This is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From 1 January, all ‘high priority’ material must have a phytosanitary certificate and require pre-notification. These will be subject to physical and identity checks that will occur at place of destination (POD) when these are designated by importers. High priority wood and wood products are detailed in section 1 above.</li>
  <li>From April 2021, all regulated material must have a phytosanitary certificate and pre-notification. Physical checks will still only be required on EU high priority goods at PODs.</li>
  <li>From July 2021, the number of physical and identity checks on regulated plants and plant products, wood, wood products and isolated bark will increase. These checks will be performed at Border Control Posts (BCPs).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for your premises to be registered as a Place of Destination for plant health physical inspections on high priority EU material from January 2021 until July 2021. Alternatively, importers of wood and wood products can choose for inspections on high priority material to take place at existing BCPs. If using the Place of Destination scheme, to comply with the requirements of this new temporary system, you must be registered as a professional operator to import or store regulated material. There are a number of other criteria you must meet for your application to be approved. These can be found in more detail on gov.uk.</p>

<p>High priority material must be made available for inspection at the place of destination before it is split or moved to other locations. The onward movement of regulated wood, wood products and isolated bark from a place of destination to other locations may require a UK plant passport. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-as-a-professional-operator-to-issue-plant-passports">find out more about plant passporting and how to become an authorised professional operator to issue plant passports on gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h4>Plant Passports</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Phytosanitary certificates (PCs) will replace plant passports for movements of regulated material between the EU and GB and vice versa.</li>
  <li>EU plant passports will no longer be used to accompany regulated plants and plant products, including wood, wood products and isolated bark, from the EU to GB or within GB.</li>
  <li>The format for the GB internal movement passport will change from the EU passport to a UK passport.</li>
  <li>GB will not use plant passports with a Protected Zone designation.</li>
  <li>UK plant passport requirements will apply to all movements within GB.  This will apply for conifers, Castanea (including sweet chestnut), Platanus (plane), Juglans (walnut) and Pterocarya (wingnut).  </li>
  <li>The same procedures for registration and authorisation of professional operators will apply. There will be no need for re-registration.</li>
  <li>UK passports cannot be issued by the EU and EU passports cannot be issued or attached in GB (passports issued in the UK may be attached in the EU until July 2021).</li>
  <li>Export PCs will be required for regulated wood, wood products and isolated bark moved to Northern Ireland not plant passports.</li>
  <li>Phytosanitary control arrangements related to the movement of material from Northern Ireland to GB and from GB to Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are being considered and will be confirmed as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you need to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are authorised to issue plant passports you will need to amend the format of these to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/assets/uploads/PTP-PP-factsheet-v4-final-.pdf." rel="external">UK guidance</a>.</li>
  <li>Continue to issue plant passports for regulated material moving within GB.</li>
  <li>Apply for an export PC for movement of regulated material to the EU or Northern Ireland.</li>
  <li>PCs must be issued by the relevant plant health inspectorates in the country of origin rather than by professional operators. PCs for regulated material will be issued in GB by the Forestry Commission.</li>
  <li>Consignments entering the EU and GB will be subject to physical checks that will differ in frequency according to the priority for the commodity concerned.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about the format for plant passports after 1 January 2021 in the latest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/assets/uploads/PTP-PP-factsheet-v4-final-.pdf" rel="external">Plant Passporting Factsheet</a>. The associated Forestry Commission e-learning will also be updated to reflect these changes from 1 January 2021.</p>

<h4>Export Phytosanitary Certificates</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Export phytosanitary certificates will replace EU plant passports for movement of regulated material from GB to the EU landing in the EU on or after 1 January 2021.</li>
  <li>PCs are necessary for the entry of regulated products at the country of destination.</li>
  <li>Exporters will need to register as an exporter with the Forestry Commission to move regulated material outlined in section 1 from GB to the EU.</li>
  <li>Exporters will need to use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-to-apply-for-a-phytosanitary-certificate">electronic application system to apply online for export phytosanitary certificates</a> (EAPC) to supply the information necessary for the Forestry Commission to issue PCs to accompany regulated material.</li>
  <li>Where necessary, PCs must carry additional declarations that are relevant to the accompanying consignment of plants or plant products.</li>
  <li>Inspections may be required prior to export dependent on the requirements of the EU.</li>
  <li>Checks will apply to regulated material as it enters the EU from GB.</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland remains within in the European Union’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary zone, so <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/legislation/new_eu_rules_en" rel="external">EU import requirements</a> will continue to apply to imports into Northern Ireland.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you need to do:</p>

<p>The process for sending regulated material to the EU will be the same as the current process for exporting to third countries. You will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>check whether a PC is required by contacting the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/" rel="external">plant health authority or a plant health inspector in the destination country</a>
</li>
  <li>if you will require export PCs for wood or wood products you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-to-apply-for-a-phytosanitary-certificate">request access to the Forestry Commission EAPC system using the form on our website</a>. You will then be able to apply online for export phytosanitary certificates.</li>
  <li>applications for PCs need to be made at least five working days before material is due to be exported. There is a charge for this service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrangements related to movement of material from the Pest Free Area (PFA) in Scotland from 1 January 2021</p>

<ul>
  <li>For movements out of the Pest Free Area (PFA) in Scotland, to Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, a PC will be used and not an EU or UK plant passport.  </li>
  <li>Coupe inspections will continue to be carried out by inspectors to confirm freedom from quarantine bark beetles before the issuance of PCs are authorised.</li>
  <li>PCs and conveyance notes will accompany shipments to Ireland as the means to trace roundwood back to the authorised felling coupes.</li>
  <li>For movements within and out of the PFA in Scotland to locations within GB a UK plant passport will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the conifer export trade from the pest free area in west Scotland the process will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The professional operator requests a felling coupe inspection from the Forestry Commission.</li>
  <li>After a successful inspection, the professional operator will receive a letter from the Forestry Commission stating that no regulated pests were found during the inspection.</li>
  <li>The professional operator then applies to the Forestry Commission for a phytosanitary certificate. The application would be supported by the Forestry Commission inspection letter.</li>
  <li>A fee will be charged for the felling coupe inspection and the issue of an export PC.</li>
  <li>You should allow at least 5 days for your application to be processed.</li>
</ul>
