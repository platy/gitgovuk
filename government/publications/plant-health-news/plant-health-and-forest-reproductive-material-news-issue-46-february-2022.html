<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Imports</h2>
<p>Following a Pest Risk Analysis and a consultation, GB-wide measures for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/phiw/riskRegister/viewPestRisks.cfm?cslref=25550" rel="external">Scolytus morawitzi</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/phiw/riskRegister/viewPestRisks.cfm?cslref=6266" rel="external">Polygraphus Proximus</a> have been introduced. Existing requirements for other pests, such as the Oak Processionary Moth have also been adjusted.</p>

<p>There are specific import requirements already in place for high-risk wood, wood product and bark (recognised hosts of these pests), therefore, the changes are unlikely to have an impact on trade.</p>

<p>The legislative changes that introduce new pest measures, or that facilitate trade, will come into force on the 2nd of March 2022. The remaining changes will come into force on 8th August 2022. Please refer to the Q&amp;A document embedded within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://planthealthportal.defra.gov.uk/latest-news/legislation-for-spring-2022/" rel="external">Defra PH portal</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The updated measures are summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Annex 7: Part A - List of plants, plant products and other objects originating from third countries and the corresponding special requirements for their introduction into Great Britain</li>
  <li>removes Taiwan from list of countries where Neocerambyx raddei (oak longhorn beetle) is known to occur</li>
  <li>
    <p>strengthens protections against Thaumetopoea processionea (oak processionary moth) risks through trade and movement</p>
  </li>
  <li>Platypus apicalis (New Zealand pinhole boring beetle) now satisfies the conditions for status as GB quarantine pest and is relisted as such from a provisional quarantine pest</li>
</ul>

<p>Corrections have also been made to the to the import conditions relating to Quercus (oak) casks from US and Canada. As explained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plant-health-news/plant-health-news-issue-44-september-2021">Newsletter 44</a>, these can continue to be exempt from Phytosanitary Certificate (PC) requirements when heat-treated as part of the manufacturing process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Exports</h2>
<p>Important news for some exports of wood to the EU and to Northern Ireland that will apply from April 11 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>New EU phytosanitary requirements to apply to wood of Quercus, Acer, Platanus and Populus</h3>
<p>To protect the EU against the highly damaging ambrosia beetle species Euwallacea and its associated fungi. The EU has adopted new entry requirements for wood from many tree species which can host the beetle in the countries where it occurs. As the beetle is not present in the UK all exports of certain types of wood will need to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate stating that the wood originates in Great Britain as a country recognised as being free from Euwallacea.</p>

<p>The wood species that are found in the UK and are controlled for Euwallacea include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Acer (sycamore)</li>
  <li>Platanus (London plane)</li>
  <li>Populus (black poplar)</li>
  <li>Quercus (common oak)</li>
  <li>Salix (white willow)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the full list of regulated species visit the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32021R2285&amp;from=EN" rel="external">EU legislation</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>New EU phytosanitary requirements to apply to hosts of Phytophthora ramorum</h3>
<p>Following Brexit, the legal status of P. ramorum isolates within Great Britain changed from being EU isolates to being regarded as non-EU isolates, despite being from similar introductions. Further measures will apply to wood of oak to prevent the entry of non-EU isolates of Phytophthora ramorum into the EU.</p>

<p>The same measures also apply to wood of Acer macrophyllum, Aesculus californica, Lithocarpus densiflorus and Taxus brevifolia, but the impact on trade of these species will be small as they are not native to the UK.
 
Most categories of oak wood exported to the EU will be affected by the new measures. The wood itself must be accompanied by a Forestry Commission issued phytosanitary certificate stating that it meets certain requirements.</p>

The name of the area shall be mentioned on the phytosanitary certificate.</td>
      <td>The FC cannot make this statement for oak originating the US, Canada, GB or Vietnam. It may be possible to make this statement if there is accompanying evidence to prove that the wood originated within the EU or in a country where P. ramorum is known not to be present.</td>

      <td>In order for the FC to make this statement evidence should be provided to prove that the wood is either square sawn, dried to below 20% moisture content or has been disinfected by an appropriate hot air or hot water method. Alternatively, an inspection of the wood to be exported can be arranged. As an example, where oak casks are charred during manufacturing this is evidence that they have been heated to high temperatures sufficient to disinfect wood (see the subsequent section).</td>

      <td>In order for the FC to make this statement evidence should be provided to prove that the wood has been through a kiln-drying schedule and is marked accordingly. Alternatively, an inspection of the wood to be exported can be arranged.</td>

<h4>Newly controlled commodities of wood</h4>
<p>The new measures above will apply to exports to the EU and to Northern Ireland where the wood and wood products under the general (CN) code headings 4401, 4403, 4404, 4406, 4407, 4408, 4409, 4416 and 9406. Detailed information is available via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32021R2285&amp;from=EN" rel="external">EU Legislation</a>.</p>

<p>The European Union has also reviewed its entry requirements for isolated bark of oak and a new prohibition will apply to this material from April 11th, 2022. The justification for the prohibition is given is given as the pest risk assessment and the pest risk management document published in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2186" rel="external">2011</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://pra.eppo.int/pra/5c4a233e-b6d2-4b83-99f2-572b50287636" rel="external">2013</a> respectively. The prohibition applies to bark exported under the CN codes for vegetable products of bark (1404 90 00) and wood waste and scrap (4401 40 90).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Electronic Application for Phytosanitary Certificates (<abbr title="Electronic Application for Phytosanitary Certificates">EAPC</abbr>)</h2>

<p>To meet the demands of exporters of timber and wood products, shorten the turnaround time to produce export phytosanitary certificates, and improve the service for all users, the Forestry Commission has been developing a replacement online <abbr title="Electronic Application for Phytosanitary Certificates">EAPC</abbr> service. This is due to come online at the end of March 2022.</p>

<p>Users of the new service will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sign-up to use the secure service (users will need a professional operator registration number and credit account number issued by the Forestry Commission)</li>
  <li>submit applications for phytosanitary certificates online</li>
  <li>submit documentation to support applications with each submission</li>
  <li>preview draft phytosanitary certificates prior to submitting applications</li>
  <li>create draft certificates and clone (copy) applications created in the new system to prevent re-keying repeat consignments and speed-up the application process</li>
  <li>maintain a record and view or withdraw all new applications or template applications created on the system</li>
</ul>

<p>Further details of the forthcoming service changes will be posted on the wood exports guidance page on GOV.UK</p>

<p>If you are exporting timber, wood products and bark and your company is not already registered as a professional operator with the Forestry Commission, visit <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-wood-wood-products-and-bark-from-great-britain">Export wood, wood products and bark from Great Britain</a> where you will find a link to the registration form. Registration is free and the form will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.</p>
