<p>This newsletter includes important updates on movement restrictions introduced to protect the country against certain introduced tree pests, imports, exports and regulation of Forest Reproductive Materials (<abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr>).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Movement Restrictions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Update on Ips typographus found in Kent and East Sussex</h3>
<p>Woodland managers, landowners, the forest industry and tree nurseries are being urged to remain vigilant after the summer findings of the larger eight-toothed European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in Kent and East Sussex.</p>

<p>A demarcated area, enforced by the Plant Health (Ips typographus) (England) Order 2019, remains in place covering parts of the Southeast of England. Within this area, additional movement restrictions apply on spruce material capable of spreading the pest. As a result of the latest findings the demarcated area has expanded this year as illustrated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eight-toothed-european-spruce-bark-beetle-ips-typographus">the updated map</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/forestry-commission-acts-on-bark-beetle-tree-pest">Further information on Ips Typographus can be found on GOV.UK.</a>.</p>

<h4>Updated information for spruce Christmas tree sellers</h4>
<p>Healthy Christmas trees are at low risk from the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus which prefers dying and stressed trees. However, to minimise the risk of further spread, transport of cut spruce Christmas trees over 3 metres tall from affected areas must be authorised by the Forestry Commission.</p>

<p>The material will be subject to inspection before dispatch and its movement must adhere to conditions set out in an authorisation letter provided by the Forestry Commission. If you grow such material in the demarcated area (see above), please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:plant.health@forestrycommission.gov.uk">plant.health@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a> for advice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Phytophthora pluvialis</h3>
<p>Phytophthora pluvialis, is a fungus-like pathogen known to affect a variety of trees including western hemlock. It was discovered in Cornwall and Devon and Cumbria and surveillance is ongoing. To protect the country against this disease, under powers conferred by The Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (England) Regulations 2019, the Forestry Commission has introduced demarcated areas around the confirmed outbreak sites and introduced movement restrictions on materials capable of spreading the disease. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/phytophthora-pluvialis">For the latest information on Phytophthora Pluvialis please see GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Imports</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>New measures for poplar wood borer (Agrilus fleischeri)</h3>
<p>New legislation for Agrilus fleischeri will come into force on 2 December 2021. This wood boring beetle is a pest of poplar and willow that is native to Asia, being found in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea and Russia. The measures apply to imports from these countries meaning that sawn wood will only be permitted under certain conditions e.g. originating in a pest free area or having had the treatment as detailed below. No changes in import requirements will be made for countries that are known to be free from the pest.</p>

<p>Treatment requirements for sawn wood imports of poplar and willow will now include bark freedom and heat treatment (56°C/30 min) or ionising irradiation achieving 1 kGy.</p>

<p>All other categories of wood products including chips, particles, sawdust, shavings, wood waste and isolated bark must originate in a pest-free area which is not within 100 km of a known outbreak of Agrilus fleischeri.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Strengthened ash legislation</h3>
<p>From 2nd December 2021, current Emerald ash borer (EAB) regulatory controls on ash wood will be extended to apply to all third country imports of sawn wood, wood chips and bark. Imports will only be permitted under certain conditions e.g. originating in a pest free area or having treatment as below. The measures are in response to the increasing threat from newly reported outbreaks of EAB in St Peterburg and Ukraine. The Forestry Commission must be pre-notified of all imports of ash wood and bark from any European countries, and such must be accompanied by phytosanitary certificates issued by the country of origin.</p>

<p>Treatment requirements for sawn wood imports of ash or bark will include ionising irradiation achieving 1 kGY.</p>

<p>The entry requirements for sawn ash wood from USA and Canada under the retained EU derogations (Decisions (EU) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2020/1002/contents/adopted" rel="external">2020/1002</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2020/918/body/adopted" rel="external">2020/918</a>, respectively) are unaffected.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Important information on notification of certain firewood imports into GB from Europe</h3>
<p>From December 2021, strengthened measures will be introduced for imports of ash firewood into GB. The new rules will apply to solid fuelwood and any chipped wood that contains ash. Ash firewood, which has been subject to notification under the firewood statutory notification scheme (SNS) will now be classified as regulated material. Shipments must be accompanied by phytosanitary certificates issued by the country of origin and notified to Forestry Commission Plant Health Inspectors prior to landing.</p>

<p>If the firewood that you import is not regulated, you should continue to use the Statutory Notification Scheme (SNS).</p>

<p>The arrangements for checks on material will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>checks may be carried out inland at Places of Destination (PoDs) until July 2022 for EU origin material. Physical checks may also take place at Border Control Posts (BCPs)</li>
  <li>import fees will apply to all regulated material</li>
  <li>from July 2022, physical and identity checks on regulated plants and plant products, wood, wood products and isolated bark will be performed at Border Control Posts (BCPs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Fumigation re-introduced as a phytosanitary treatment for certain types of wood</h3>
<p>Where certain fumigation measures were omitted from retained EU regulation these have been re-instated in the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulations. The measures that are reinstated apply as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to entries 109 to 114 for conifer wood and wood chips originating from various countries</li>
  <li>to entries 131 for oak wood chips and 137 for maple and poplar wood chips originating from Canada and the USA</li>
</ul>

<p>The amending legislation is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1229/pdfs/uksi_20211229_en.pdf" rel="external">The Animal Health, Plant Health, Seeds and Seed Potatoes (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Exports</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>New revised Electronic Application for Phytosanitary Application (EAPC) system launch delayed until early 2022</h3>

<p>Due to unforeseen technical issues, the anticipated Autumn 2021 EAPC system launch date is now expected to be the first quarter of 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Festive period closure – export phytosanitary certificate applications</h3>
<p>The Plant Health Forestry office will be closed from 24 December 2021 to 4 January 2022. Please apply for any export phytosanitary certificates by Wednesday 15 December to ensure that they can be processed in good time.</p>

<p>To help us to help you, an early indication of shipments (especially conifer roundwood), due in January, would help us to manage peak demand.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Forest Reproductive Material</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Online Forest Reproductive Material (<abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr>) system launched</h3>
<p>The phased role out of the new system began on 26 October.</p>

<p>The new system allows users to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>apply online to become an <abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr> supplier</li>
  <li>apply online to become a Basic Material Manager (BMM)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an <abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr> officer has checked and authorised an application to become an <abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr> supplier or a Basic Material Manager, the user will be able to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>notify the Forestry Commission through their on-line <abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr> Supplier account of their intention to Collect seed or take cuttings</li>
  <li>apply to the Forestry Commission through their on-line <abbr title="Forest Reproductive Material">FRM</abbr> Supplier account for a Master certificate for a collection</li>
  <li>apply to register seed stands, seed orchards, clonal material or parents of tree families material</li>
  <li>once approved, update and amend details of their Basic Material</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can view their seed collection notifications and their Master certificates.</p>

<p>Basic Material Managers can view records of the Basic Material that they have registered.</p>
