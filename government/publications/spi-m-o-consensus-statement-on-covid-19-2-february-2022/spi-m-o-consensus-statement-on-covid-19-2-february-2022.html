<h2>Potential for growth in transmission</h2>

<p>1. Both behaviour change and the testing and isolation of infected people are acting to reduce transmission of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. SPI-M-O has been asked to consider the extent to which all measures and behaviour change are currently reducing transmission, compared to a pre-pandemic baseline.</p>

<p>2. The University of Warwick has estimated that, at present, a combination of measures and behavioural change since before the pandemic (such as, but not limited to testing, self-isolation, mask wearing, increased home working and the avoidance of high-risk settings) are reducing transmission by approximately 20% to 45%.</p>

<p>3. Warwick’s estimates are equivalent to there being the potential for transmission to increase by between around 25% to 80% if the population were to return to pre-pandemic behaviours and no mitigations. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> <abbr title="Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours">SPI-B</abbr> is considering how behaviour is likely to change in the medium to long term as the Omicron wave subsides and the remaining measures are lifted. Warwick’s analysis indicates that, while behaviour change following the lifting of restrictions has previously been gradual, a sudden change, such as an end to testing and isolation, has the scope to lead to a return to rapid epidemic growth.</p>

<p>4. Other factors that could act to increase or decrease transmission include waning immunity, novel variants, seasonality, and the build-up of immunity from vaccines and infection. The <abbr title="Omicron sub-variant">BA.2</abbr> variant may have a growth advantage over other Omicron sub-lineages. If this were the case, it is possible that SPI-M-O’s medium-term projections may underestimate the short-term trajectory of hospitalisations.</p>

<h2>Evaluation of medium-term scenarios</h2>

<p>5. On several occasions over the past 2 years, SPI-M-O has produced sets of medium-term scenarios. These are sets of scenarios in which the reproduction number, <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>, is set to a specific value from a given date. After this, the only change in transmission comes from a build-up in immunity. These are not forecasts nor predictions, but provide both a structured way of thinking about the implications of different changes in transmission in advance, and to evaluate the impact of those changes after implementation.</p>

<p>6. Figure 1 shows 5 sets of medium-term scenarios for hospital admissions in England that align to Step 3 of February’s Roadmap for removing restrictions (May 2021); Step 4 of the Roadmap (July 2021); the end of school summer holidays (September 2021); the start of winter (November 2021); and the removal of Plan B measures (January 2022). <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p>7. Of the 4 sets of modelling which can currently be evaluated, the first 2 tracked around the central scenarios modelled. In the third, the (relatively modest) increase in admissions happened later than had been expected following the return of schools. The fourth, produced prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant, was in line with the higher growth scenario before diverging as Omicron rapidly increased transmission.</p>

<p>8. One striking factor is that between the end of the ‘pingdemic’ (July) and the start of the Omicron wave in December, hospital admissions were relatively flat, with no periods of sustained rapid growth or decline. Although admissions to hospital were broadly flat, there were large changes in infection rates in different age groups at different times.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Projected <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> daily hospital admissions in England, if the reproduction number, <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr>, were to change to different values (indicated by different colour lines) at different time points (the vertical dashed lines give the dates the projections were made, based on the latest available data at the time). The overlaid circles are the number of admissions that occurred. Shaded bands show the interquartile ranges of the model combinations. The different values of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> considered here are given in the table below. Note the log scale.</p>
