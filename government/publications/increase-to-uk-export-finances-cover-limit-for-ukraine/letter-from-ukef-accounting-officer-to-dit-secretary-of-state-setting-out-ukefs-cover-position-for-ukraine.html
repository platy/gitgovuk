<p>7 December 2021</p>

<p>Dear Secretary of State,</p>

<h2>Increasing UK Export Finance’s market appetite for Ukraine</h2>

<p>You have considered advice relating to the potential uplift to <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s market limit for Ukraine beyond that suggested by our Exposure Management Framework (<abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr>). Given high levels of demand for UK Export Finance (<abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>) support in Ukraine, allowing the full range of prospective UK exports to be supported would require <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to operate a market limit outside of the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr>. This letter sets out my position as Accounting Officer on the issue.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> operates under the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> agreed with HM Treasury that is designed to allow <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to provide support where it is needed for UK exporters while managing potential risks to the Exchequer arising from both individual transactions, overall exposure in a particular market, and across the <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> portfolio. This forms the basis of <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s normal underwriting criteria and going outside of the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> is not permitted under the terms of HM Treasury’s standing consent for <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> (the “Consent”).</p>

<p>I previously advised you that a market limit increase for Ukraine cannot be accommodated within <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s normal underwriting criteria. Following a market review it was determined that due to deteriorating market conditions in Ukraine (principally as a result of the impact of COVID 19), any uplift would be outside of the limits set by the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr>, and thus would not be permitted under the Consent.</p>

<p>Managing Public Money requires me to ensure that any transactions that <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> supports represent value for money to taxpayers, meet tests of regularity and propriety and are feasible. The key test in this case is regularity in complying with the terms of the Consent with particular reference to <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr>. To be clear, I do not think that exceeding the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> limit for Ukraine would expose <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> to extreme or catastrophic risk of loss. <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr> would also charge adequate premium to ensure it continues to operate at no net cost in relation to any business with Ukraine, whether inside or outside of the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> limit. However, the terms of the Consent do not permit me as Accounting Officer to agree to take risk in excess of those allowed by the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> for any given market. However, I recognise that you may wish to take broader view.</p>

<p>If that is your decision I will proceed accordingly but require your written instruction to do so due to the issue noted above concerning regularity.</p>

<p>I note that under the Export and Investment Guarantees Act the consent of the Treasury is required for your instruction to be lawful. The Chancellor has agreed with your view that it is in the national interest to increase <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>’s market appetite for Ukraine beyond the <abbr title="Exposure Management Framework">EMF</abbr> limit and agreed that HM Treasury will consent should you instruct me to proceed. I will ensure the necessary steps are taken to carry forward your instruction without delay.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the attention you have paid to this issue. I am satisfied that your decision will be taken on the basis of the available information. In line with normal practice for directions, I am required to alert the Comptroller and Auditor General, who will inform the Public Accounts Committee (which may decide to conduct an inquiry), and the Treasury Officer of Accounts.</p>

<p>In addition, it is normal practice for you to inform Parliament where you issue an instruction to <abbr title="UK Export Finance">UKEF</abbr>. Our exchange of letters will also be published in line with normal practice for a direction.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Louis Taylor</p>

<p>Chief Executive</p>

<p>UK Export Finance</p>
