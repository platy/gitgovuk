<p>It is important that you read this privacy notice together with the specific section of the notice that governs the processing activity that is relevant to you, in addition to any other privacy notice or fair processing notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your data.</p>

<h3>How we keep your personal data secure</h3>

<p>Homes England takes the security of all the data we hold very seriously. We adhere to internationally recognised security standards. Our Information Security Management System (ISMS), utilises ISO/IEC27001:2013 as a framework and the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model is adopted.</p>

<p>We have policies, procedures and training in place covering data protection, confidentiality and security and regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the data we hold secure.</p>

<h3>Disclosures of your personal data</h3>

<p>We may share your personal data with third parties including third-party service providers, regulatory bodies, the police and other government departments and agencies. Where we do so, we will require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>We or our third parties may transfer your personal data outside the EU. Where we do so, we have put in place measures to ensure your personal information is provided with adequate protection in accordance with data protection legislation.</p>

<p>For more information about the purposes for which we may share your data with third parties, please refer to the relevant section of this privacy notice that governs each specific processing activity.</p>

<h3>Retention</h3>

<p>Homes England will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data</li>

  <li>the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means</li>
  <li>the applicable legal or regulatory requirements.</li>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

<h3>Our role as data controller</h3>

<p>The Homes and Communities Agency, trading as Homes England, is a ‘data controller’ for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 1998 (as updated, amended and re-enacted from time to time).
