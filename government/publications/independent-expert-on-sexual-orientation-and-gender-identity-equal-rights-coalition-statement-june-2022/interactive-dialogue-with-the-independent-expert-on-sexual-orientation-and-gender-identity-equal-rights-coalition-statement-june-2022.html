<p>Mr President,</p>

<p>I have the honor to deliver this statement on behalf of all 42 Member States of the [Equal Rights Coalition], a cross-regional intergovernmental body dedicated to the protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people and to promoting inclusive development in both member and non-member countries.</p>

<p>The Equal Rights Coalition advances its mission of protecting and promoting the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities globally by engaging with civil society organisations and multilateral agencies. In this endeavor, the work of the UN Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been of great value and importance.</p>

<p>We thank the Independent Expert for his report presented today on “the realization of the right to health in relation to Sustainable Development Goal No. 3”. This work is a clear example of the important role of this mandate in shedding light on specific human rights situations of LGBTI and gender diverse persons and helping Member States to improve their legislation and policies to leave no one behind.</p>

<p>Over the past six years, the mandate holders have engaged in constructive dialogue with Member States and civil society as well as other UN human rights mechanisms, providing technical assistance, capacity-building and international cooperation to combat violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

<p>Despite progress towards equality, discrimination continues in all regions of the world and there is still more work that needs to be done to advance the human rights of LGBTI. We therefore strongly support the resolution that will be tabled in this session to, once again, renew the mandate of the Independent Expert.</p>

<p>Mr President,</p>

<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly states that “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”.</p>

<p>This is the ultimate goal of this mandate, to ensure that no one is subjected to violence and discrimination on any grounds, including because of their sexual orientation and gender identity. These are core principles that should guide the work of this body. We therefore call on all Council Members to support the renewal of the mandate of the Independent Expert on SOGI and on all Member States to keep working in collaboration with this important Mandate.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
