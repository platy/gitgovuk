<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> CO2 emissions</h3>

<p>To qualify for the scheme, the taxi’s tailpipe CO2 emissions in combination with its zero-emission range must be such that the vehicle falls into 1 of the following 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for Category 1 <abbr title="plug-in taxi grant">PiTG</abbr> (up to £7,500) - have a zero-emission range of 70 miles or more and emissions of less than 50gCO2/km</li>
  <li>for Category 2 <abbr title="plug-in taxi grant">PiTG</abbr> (up to £3,000) – have a zero-emission range of 10 to 69 miles and emissions of less than 50gCO2/km</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To verify the vehicle’s tailpipe CO2 emissions, provide one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the communication form issued by the authority approving the vehicle to UN-ECE Regulation 101, showing CO2 emissions of 50g/km or less</li>
  <li>a copy of the approval certificate that shows compliance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007, showing CO2 emissions of 50g/km or less</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Zero emission range</h3>

<p>The vehicle must have a zero-emission range such that when considered together with its CO2 emissions it falls into <a class="govuk-link" href="#categories">one of the 2 categories specified</a>.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>To verify the vehicle’s zero emission range, provide one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the communication form issued by the authority approving the vehicle to UN-ECE Regulation 101</li>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Minimum speed requirements</h3>

<p>To allow safe use on trunk roads and motorways, taxis must be able to travel at a speed of at least 60mph (96 km/h).</p>

<p>Different manufacturers use different processes for assessing maximum speed. This, alongside other environmental factors, introduces considerable variation in real-world performance.</p>

<p>In the event of credible concerns appearing about the vehicle achieving a maximum speed of 60 mph (96 km/h) in service, then the applicant will need to pay for the vehicle to be assessed in accordance with the technical requirements of UN ECE Regulation 68 to address those concerns.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for Transport reserves the right to impose this requirement on all applications throughout the lifetime of the scheme.</p>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>whole vehicle type approval documents</li>
  <li>a copy of the publicly available specification of the vehicle stating that the vehicle has a top speed of 60 mph (96 km/h) or greater</li>
  <li>a signed statement of vehicle maximum speed 60 mph (96 km/h) or greater, stating that this value will be made publicly available</li>
  <li>a copy of an approval certificate for UNECE Regulation 68</li>

</ul>

<p>Further information on what each piece of accepted evidence requires is given in <a class="govuk-link" href="government/publications/plug-in-taxi-grants-eligibility-and-applications/guidelines-for-preparing-battery-degradation-evidence">Guidelines for preparing battery degradation evidence</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Crash safety</h3>

<p>Vehicles must demonstrate that they meet the minimum safety requirements of the plug-in taxi grant scheme.</p>

<p>There are 2 routes to demonstrate compliance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>homologation to category M1 through EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval, UK(NI) whole vehicle type approval or GB whole vehicle type approval</li>
  <li>evidence that the vehicle satisfies the crash safety standards of&nbsp;the accepted whole vehicle type approval route</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the whole vehicle type approval certificate for the model of the taxi that is being presented to the VCA</li>
  <li>relevant crash test certificate for the model of vehicle that is being presented for approval to&nbsp;VCA</li>
</ul>

<p>If vehicle has an individual vehicle approval, the relevant crash test reports must be submitted in the document pack</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> reserves the right to require the applicant to complete crash testing if it is considered that the data provided is insufficient, or the results inconclusive.</p>

<p>VCA reserves the right to see system an component approvals.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> Electrical safety</h3>

<p>Applicants should provide a copy of the approval certificate and full document pack to&nbsp;UNECE&nbsp;Regulation 100.02.</p>

<p>If the applicant is not able to supply UNECE Regulation 100.02 certificate and full document pack, they must supply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the approval documentation and certificates to UNECE R100.01</li>
  <li>evidence to show that the additional technical requirements of the 02 series of amendments have been met</li>
</ul>

<p>For vehicles approved through the&nbsp;NSSTA&nbsp;or&nbsp;<abbr title="individual vehicle approval">IVA</abbr>&nbsp;routes, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>) is temporarily allowing evidence of certification to&nbsp;UNECE&nbsp;Reg 100.01 only.</p>

<p>From July 2022,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;is likely to require evidence that the technical requirements of the 02 series of amendments have been met.</p>

<p>This will apply to vehicles already approved for the grant and new applicants.</p>

<h3>Further electrical safety</h3>

<p>The applicant must also provide evidence of action taken to mitigate electrical safety risks not covered by Regulation 100.</p>

<p>In particular, this must include a statement of what actions they will take to inform consumers about the safest way to charge and use their vehicle.</p>

<p>Issues to cover must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what voltage and amperage requirement will be needed to safely charge the vehicle</li>
  <li>what electrical safety advice will be provided to the purchaser</li>
  <li>whether charging infrastructure will require the installation of additional safety equipment or separate circuits</li>
  <li>how the applicant will ensure that the necessary equipment has been provided and/or circuits safely installed by the time the vehicle is delivered to the consumer</li>
  <li>how the actions of the applicant will ensure compliance with the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC</li>
  <li>submitting written confirmation that the applicant will provide documentation with the vehicle that explains the safe operation and charging of the vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best practice for providing evidence</h3>

<p>Examples of best practice for providing evidence include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 1 page leaflet for new customers outlining electrical safety issues</li>
  <li>a comprehensive instruction manual with detailed instructions for owners on how to safely recharge and maintain their vehicle and risks to avoid</li>
  <li>requirement or recommendation that the consumer has a survey performed on their premises wiring</li>
  <li>advice on how to install a dedicated home charging unit, with details of potential companies who can carry out the work</li>
  <li>evidence of dealership training to ensure dealers can correctly advise on electrical safety during the sales process</li>
  <li>if relevant, indication of training so that technicians and mechanics can safely service the vehicle</li>
  <li>blueprints/information to emergency services on how to correctly deal with an incident involving the relevant vehicle (such as, where the battery is located or which wires to cut)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it is felt that the applicant has taken insufficient measures, the VCA reserves the right to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reject the application</li>
  <li>stipulate that the applicant undertake certain additional measures before the vehicle can be deemed eligible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accepted evidence</h4>

<p>One of the following is required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of the type approval certificate and document pack to UN-ECE Reg 100.02</li>
  <li>a copy of the type approval certificate and document pack to UN-ECE Reg 100.01, and evidence that technical requirements for 02 series of amendments are met</li>
</ul>
