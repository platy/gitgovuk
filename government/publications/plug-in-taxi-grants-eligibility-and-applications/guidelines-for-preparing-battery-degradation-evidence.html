<p>The applicant must demonstrate that the battery or fuel cell used to drive the vehicle’s propulsion system has an acceptably low rate of degradation.</p>

<p>As a guide to applicants, pending the evidence presented in each case, an acceptable level of degradation is defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for battery electric vehicles, the battery must maintain at least 80% of its initial or rated charge capacity for the initial 3 years or 70% of initial or rated charge capacity for the initial 5 years</li>
  <li>for fuel cell vehicles, the fuel stack must maintain at least 90% of its rated voltage output for the initial 5 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the newness of this technology, we are prepared to work with manufacturers who supply alternative evidence which provides what the Vehicle Certification Agency (<abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr>) considers to be a reasonable level of reassurance to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Assessing written assurance evidence</h2>

<p>In cases where the applicant is seeking approval via <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/plug-in-taxi-grants-eligibility-and-applications/how-to-complete-the-pitg-application-form">written assurance of reasonable performance</a>, the evidence provided may be in the form of illustrative evidence of the degradation rate under certain conditions, such as under an accelerated testing regime.</p>

<p>This must be supported by an explanation of the way in which this evidence demonstrates long-term maintenance of the performance.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> may <a class="govuk-link" href="#elements">consider the following elements</a> as indicators of quality sufficient to offer reasonable performance during normal use. In this context, they will consider what is appropriate to the vehicle and range/performance stated by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>The applicant may wish to identify the possible failure modes and mitigating actions that have been taken.</p>

<p>As a guide to the level of detail expected, we would not expect the evidence submitted to require more than 10 pages. Annexes can be provided.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Vehicle Certification Agency">VCA</abbr> and/or supporting independent technical experts may request additional information to inform assessment of the application.</p>

<h2>What will be assessed: written assurance</h2>

<p>The following types of indicators or factors which the panel and independent technical experts will take into account when assessing this evidence are:</p>

<h3>Battery cell</h3>

<p>Data at the cell level can include the published test data of cell manufacturers.</p>

<h4>Transportation</h4>

<p>Conforms to UN transport standard ST/SG/AC.10/27.</p>

<h4>Cycling tests</h4>

<p>Provide appropriate evidence, to represent the final application of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>c-rating</li>
  <li>depth of discharge</li>
  <li>influence of temperature on characteristics</li>
</ul>

<h4>Self discharge rates</h4>

<p>Values and method of establishing them.</p>

<h4>Impedance</h4>

<p>Measurement method and evolution with both elapsed time and use.</p>

<h4>Capacity</h4>

<p>Measurement method and evolution with both elapsed time and use.</p>

<h3>Battery pack</h3>

<p>Evidence needs to clearly show how the cells have been combined to produce performance in a battery pack that meets the stated specification.</p>

<h4>Mechanical integrity</h4>

<ul>
  <li>resistance to stresses caused by dimensional changes of cells in operation</li>
  <li>what vibration, strength and damage testing has been performed?</li>
  <li>strategy for preventing and containing effects of cell failures</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thermal integrity</h4>

<p>Provide a summary of your thermal management strategy and how it is achieved, such as for example cell-to-cell temperature variation and overall pack temperature control.</p>

<p>What cooling strategy has been put in place to support the operation of the battery in the UK environment?</p>

<h4>Cycling tests</h4>

<ul>
  <li>are the tests appropriate to the claimed usage of the vehicle?</li>
  <li>are the cycling profiles, ratings and temperatures of the tests appropriate?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Environmental resistance</h4>

<ul>
  <li>what is the <abbr title="ingress protection">IP</abbr> rating of the pack?</li>
  <li>resistance to dusts and liquid and gaseous contaminants</li>
  <li>resistance to extremes of temperature</li>
</ul>

<h4>Battery management system (<abbr title="battery management system">BMS</abbr>)</h4>

<p>How does the <abbr title="battery management system">BMS</abbr> ensure that the individual cells are not required to operate outside of its specification?</p>

<h3>Vehicle</h3>

<p>The integration of a battery pack into the operational context of a vehicle can impact on the battery degradation rate. How has this been considered by the manufacturer?</p>

<p>In addition to the points below, the issues considered at the pack level should also be addressed at the vehicle level.</p>

<h4>Onboard diagnostics</h4>

<p>What error and information messages will be provided to the driver on the status of the battery?</p>

<p>What error messages will be recorded for maintenance?</p>

<h4>Dirt, dust, water ingress and mechanical stress</h4>

<p>What measures have been taken to assess and control these factors?</p>

<h4>Fire performance</h4>

<p>Is there a report that confirms appropriate testing has been carried out?</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>To note: similar guidance will be supplied on preparing fuel cell degradation evidence as more fuel cell vehicles come to market.</p>
