<hr>

<p>The Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service (<abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr>) undertakes a range of statistical analyses on the data provided and produces 6 reports summarising activity and performance.</p>

<p>Four reports are produced for each 6-monthly data submission (reports 1 to 4 below). Two national cycle reports are produced at the end of each 6-month cycle, one for laboratory data and another for ultrasound data (reports 5 and 6, below).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Detailed laboratory report for each screening laboratory/network</h2>

<p>This report contains information on all aspects of the screening data submitted by the laboratory, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>summary statistics on the demographic information of the population screened</li>
  <li>estimated standardised screen positive rates (<abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr>) for each test provided</li>
  <li>details of each biochemical marker used by the laboratory</li>
  <li>a summary of the ultrasound data from the ultrasound department(s) that the laboratory provides a service for</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> parameter estimates for log <abbr title="multiples of the normal median">MoM</abbr> values from routine samples</li>
</ul>

<p>Laboratories that are part of a network will have one pooled <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> report for the screening strategy that is part of the network. This report is sent to the named laboratory lead for the network.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Summary laboratory/network report</h2>

<p>The content of this report is agreed on a follow-up phone call between the laboratory lead and the lead statistician. This document outlines information such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>screening test(s) provided with associated software and equipment used</li>
  <li>estimated annual number of pregnancies screened with each test</li>
  <li>estimated standardised <abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr> for each test</li>
  <li>agreed list of recommendations and actions</li>
  <li>providers served for each screening test</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Feedback plot (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>/<abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr>) for individual ultrasound practitioner</h2>

<p>The feedback plot (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>/<abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr>) for individual ultrasound practitioner (from here on known as the feedback plot) gives feedback on measurements of nuchal translucency (<abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr>) and crown rump length (<abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr>), over a 6-month <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> reporting cycle.</p>

<p>All ultrasound practitioners, including trainees, should receive their feedback plot from their screening support sonographer (<abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr>) every 6 months.</p>

<p>If any data set suggests an ultrasound practitioner requires further support or training, through a red flag for throughput, bias or spread, the associated plots are also shared with the national and regional screening quality assurance service (<abbr title="screening quality assurance service">SQAS</abbr>).</p>

<p>The feedback plot below shows an example of a data set with adequate throughput and the measurements are consistent for bias and spread with the fetal medicine foundation (<abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr>) reference curve.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144467/__8.SVG"></div></figure>

<p>The plot shows <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> on the vertical axis, against <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> on the horizontal axis. Each point is a paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurement and the blue curve is the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve. At the top ID shows the practitioner’s <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> code and the number of measurements in the data set.</p>

<p>The grey band shown in the feedback plot helps with the interpretation of bias and spread.</p>

<p>When measurements are consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference, approximately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>50% of all measurements are expected to lie within the grey band</li>
  <li>25% of all measurements are expected to lie above the grey band</li>
  <li>25% of all measurements are expected to lie below the grey band</li>
</ul>

<p>The plot provides further feedback on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>throughput: the number of paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements performed in a <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> 6-month reporting cycle</li>
  <li>bias: the average deviation in <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements from the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve</li>
  <li>spread: the scatter of points around the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1070575/Nuchal_translucency_and_crown_rump_length_diagnostic_plot_self-assessment_tool.xlsx" rel="external">diagnostic plot self-assessment tool</a> is provided to assist monitoring of <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements. We recommend using weekly or monthly depending on the number of scans performed. The tool is not designed to be used at the time of the scan to compare measurements to the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Criteria for assigning flags to a data set</h3>

<p>Flags can be assigned for throughput, bias and spread. The table below shows how flags are assigned.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144500/Screenshot_2022-03-03_135214.svg.jpg"></div></figure>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Throughput</h3>

<p>Throughput is the number of paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements performed in a <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> 6-month reporting cycle.</p>

<p>To reliably assess bias and spread, a minimum throughput of 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements is required.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> should maintain a log of reasons for low throughput.</p>

<p>If there are fewer than 25 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements in an ultrasound practitioner’s first data submission, no flag is assigned.</p>

<p>If the minimum throughput in one cycle is not met, the most recent 25 paired measurements from the last 4 cycles (24 months) are combined.</p>

<p>If a data set contains fewer than 25 paired measurements over 4 cycles (24 months), a red flag for throughput is assigned.</p>

<p>Bias and spread will not be reported for this data set. The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and ultrasound practitioner use the process following a red flag for throughput to develop a supportive action plan.</p>

<p>The table below shows examples of how <abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> assigns flags when the ultrasound practitioner has not met the minimum requirement of 25 paired measurements in one cycle.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Ultrasound practitioner 9898989 was on long-term sick leave and only has 8 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements in the current cycle.</p>

<p><abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> combines those 8 with the most recent 17 measurements from the previous cycle. This adds up to 25 measurements and the bias and spread can be estimated. The following flags are assigned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>green flag for bias (estimated bias is 0.08mm)</li>
  <li>no spread flag is shown (spread is consistent with <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve)</li>
</ul>

<p>Practice continues as bias and spread are consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Ultrasound practitioner 7676767 has returned from maternity leave and only has 4 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements in the current cycle.</p>

<p><abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> combines those 4 with measurements from the previous 2 cycles (12 + 9). This adds up to 25 measurements and bias and spread can be estimated. The following flags are assigned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>red flag for bias (estimated bias is -0.36mm)</li>
  <li>no spread flag is shown (spread is consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and practitioner develop a supportive action plan for bias.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Ultrasound practitioner 5454545 only has 2 paired <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> and <abbr title="crown-rump length">CRL</abbr> measurements in the current cycle.</p>

<p><abbr title="Down’s syndrome screening quality assurance support service">DQASS</abbr> combines those 2 with measurements from the previous 3 cycles (5 + 6 + 3). The data set still has fewer than 25 measurements and bias and spread cannot be reliably estimated. The following flag will be assigned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>red flag for throughput</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and practitioner develop a supportive action plan for throughput.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Bias on feedback plots</h3>

<p>Bias is the average deviation in <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements from the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve.</p>

<p>Bias is negative when <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements, overall, are smaller than expected and positive when, overall, they are larger than expected.</p>

<p>A negative bias reduces the screen positive rate (<abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr>) and detection rate (<abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr>). This can result in a higher proportion of false negative results.</p>

<p>A positive bias increases the <abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr> and the <abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr>. This can lead to more prenatal diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>The table below shows the effect of bias on <abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr> and <abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr>.</p>

<span class="number">3.4 </span>Spread on feedback plots</h3>

<p><abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements should have an expected spread or scatter around the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve.</p>

<p>Spread is increased when <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements are more scattered than expected.</p>

<p>Spread is decreased when <abbr title="nuchal translucency">NT</abbr> measurements are less scattered than expected.</p>

<p>If the scatter of measurements is consistent with the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve, no flag for spread is assigned.</p>

<p>If measurements are substantially less scattered, or measurements are substantially more scattered than expected a red flag for spread is assigned. The <abbr title="screening support sonographer">SSS</abbr> and ultrasound practitioner use the process following a red flag for bias and/or spread  to develop a supportive action plan.</p>

<p>Decreased spread reduces the <abbr title="screen positive rates">SPR</abbr> and <abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr>. This can result in a higher proportion of false negative results. The series of plots in the graphic below show how reduction in spread can affect the <abbr title="detection rate">DR</abbr> for trisomy 21 (T21).</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/145606/__16.svg"></div></figure>

<p>The 2 examples below show feedback plots with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decreased spread</li>
  <li>increased spread</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these examples, there is no substantive bias relative to the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve and throughput is greater than 25 paired measurements.</p>

<h4>Example of decreased spread</h4>

<p>The feedback plot below shows a red flag for decreased spread.</p>

<p>Measurements tend to scatter close to the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>95% of measurements within the grey band</li>
  <li>2% of measurements above the grey band</li>
  <li>3% of measurements below the grey band</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/144475/__12.SVG"></div></figure>

<h4>Example of increased spread</h4>

<p>The feedback plot below shows a red flag for increased spread.</p>

<p>Measurements tend to scatter further from the <abbr title="Fetal Medicine Foundation">FMF</abbr> reference curve than expected with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>21% of measurements within the grey band</li>
  <li>39% of measurements above the grey band</li>
  <li>40% of measurements below the grey band</li>
</ul>
