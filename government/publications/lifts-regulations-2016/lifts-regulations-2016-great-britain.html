<p><strong>Guidance on the regulations they apply to lifts and components being supplied in or into Great Britain.</strong></p>

<p>May 2022</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This Guide is for businesses placing lifts and safety components for lifts on the market in Great Britain. If you are placing lifts and safety components for lifts on the market in Northern Ireland, you should read separate guidance:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lifts-regulations-2016">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<p>This Guide is designed to help you comply with The Lifts Regulations 2016, as amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (referred to in this document as “the 2016 Regulations”). The 2016 Regulations set out the requirements which must be met before products within their scope can be placed on the GB market. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure safe products are placed on the GB market by requiring manufacturers and installers to show how their products meet the ‘essential health and safety requirements’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Legislative Background</h2>

<p>The Lifts Regulations 2016 implemented into UK law EU Directive (2014/33/EU) relating to lifts and safety components for lifts. The EU Withdrawal Act 2018 preserves the Regulations and enables them to be amended so as to continue to function effectively now the UK has left the EU. Accordingly, the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-1">see footnote 1</a> fix any deficiencies that arose from the UK leaving the EU (such as references to EU institutions) and make specific provision for the GB market.</p>

<p>There is therefore one set of UK 2016 Regulations, but some of the provisions apply differently in NI for as long as the Northern Ireland Protocol is in force. References to the 2016 Regulations in this guidance are references to those Regulations as they apply in Great Britain. For guidance on placing on the Northern Ireland market, please see:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lifts-regulations-2016">Read guidance on the regulations in Northern Ireland</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Scope</h2>

<p>The 2016 Regulations apply to lifts permanently serving buildings or constructions and safety components for use in such lifts.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulations do not apply to lifts and safety components for lifts placed on the GB market before 8 December 2016.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulations do not apply to a lift or a safety component for lifts insofar as and to the extent that the essential health and safety requirements relate to risks wholly or partly covered by other specific enactments applicable to that lift or safety component. There are also other exclusions set out in the 2016 Regulations. For a full list of exclusions please refer to the 2016 Regulations.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1093/contents/made" rel="external">Lifts Regulations 2016</a> – legislation.gov.uk</p>

<p>Please note the 2016 Regulations were amended to correct a minor but important error in Regulation 3.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1186/contents/made" rel="external">Lifts (Amendment) Regulations 2016</a> – legislation.gov.uk</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Obligations of installers</h2>

<p>An installer is a person who takes responsibility for the design, manufacture, installation and placing on the GB market of a lift.</p>

<p>The obligations of installers of lifts include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before placing a lift on the GB market, an installer must ensure that it has been designed, manufactured, installed and tested in accordance with the essential health and safety requirements and that they have ensured it has been subject to a relevant conformity assessment procedure and the relevant technical documentation has been drawn up.</li>
  <li>Once these steps have been completed, and before placing a lift on the GB market, an installer must draw up a declaration of conformity <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-2">see footnote 2</a>, and ensure that the declaration accompanies the lift and affix the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-3">see footnote 3</a> visibly, legibly and indelibly to the lift carrier. Until 31 December 2023 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-4">see footnote 4</a>, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label or a document accompanying the lift.</li>
  <li>Installers must keep the declaration of conformity up to date and must keep it and where applicable, any approval decision, as well as the relevant technical documentation for 10 years.</li>
  <li>Installers must also label their products with their name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and address; the type batch or serial number (or other identification) and ensure that they are accompanied by relevant instructions in clear, legible and easily understandable English.</li>
  <li>Installers must when appropriate investigate any complaints that the lifts they have installed are not in conformity with the requirements and keep records of these complaints.</li>
  <li>Installers must take action where they have reason to believe that the lifts are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulations by bringing the lift components into conformity, withdrawing the components or recalling the components. Where the components present a risk, the installer must immediately inform the market surveillance authority (MSA), giving details of how the components are not in conformity and any corrective measures taken. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>Installers must also cooperate with and provide information to enforcing authorities following any requests.</li>
  <li>Installers and the person responsible for work on a building or construction where a lift is to be installed must also provide each other with the necessary information and take the appropriate steps to ensure the proper operation and safe use of the lift.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Obligations of manufacturers</h2>

<p>A manufacturer is a person who manufactures a safety component for lifts, or has such a safety component designed or manufactured, and markets that safety component under their name or trademark.</p>

<p>The obligations of manufacturers of safety components for lifts include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Before placing a safety component on the GB market, a manufacturer must ensure that it has been designed and manufactured in accordance with the essential health and safety requirements and that they have had have a relevant conformity assessment procedure carried out and technical documentation drawn up.</li>
  <li>Once these steps are complete, but before placing the component on the GB market, a manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity, ensure that declaration accompanies the safety component and affix the UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-5">see footnote 5</a> visibly, legibly and indelibly to the safety component for lifts. Until 31 December 2023 <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-6">see footnote 6</a>, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to, or a document accompanying, the component. This applies whatever the nature of the safety component. Where it is not possible on account of the nature of the safety component to affix the UKCA marking to the safety component it must be affixed to a label inseparably attached to the safety component.</li>
  <li>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be placed on the GB market with the CE and CE UKNI conformity markings, see further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must keep the declaration of conformity up to date and keep it, the technical documentation and where appropriate any approval decision, for 10 years after the product has been placed on the market.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must also label the safety components for lifts with their name, registered trade name or registered trademark and address; the type batch or serial number (or other identification); and ensure that they are accompanied by relevant instructions in clear, legible and easily understandable English.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must put procedures in place to ensure that series production remains in conformity with the Regulations and, when appropriate, take action to monitor safety components made available on the GB market by them which may present a risk, keeping a register of such components and any complaints or action taken.</li>
  <li>When appropriate, having regard to the risks to the health and safety of end users presented by a safety component for lifts, the manufacturer must carry out sample testing of safety components they manufactured and investigate any complaints that the safety components are not in conformity, keep records of these complaints for at least 10 years and keep installers and distributors informed of actions carried out.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must take action where they have reason to believe that the lifts are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulations by bringing the lift components into conformity, withdrawing the components or recalling the components. Where the components present a risk, the manufacturer must immediately inform the market surveillance authority, giving details of how the components are not in conformity and any corrective measures taken. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>Manufacturers must also cooperate with and when requested provide information and documentation to enforcing authorities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Manufacturers based in Northern Ireland can follow the legislation as it applies to Northern Ireland and place qualifying Northern Ireland goods on the GB market without any additional approvals. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Obligations of authorised representatives</h2>

<p>Manufacturers or installers are able by written mandate to appoint authorised representatives to perform certain tasks on their behalf.</p>

<p>Mandated authorised representatives for the GB market can be based in GB or Northern Ireland, but cannot be based outside the UK. A manufacturer or installer can only mandate an authorised representative established in the UK, under the 2016 Regulations as they apply in GB.</p>

<p>No GB-based authorised representatives are recognised under EU law. This means GB-based authorised representatives cannot carry out tasks on the installer’s behalf for a lift or on the manufacturer’s behalf for a safety component for lifts being placed on the Northern Ireland or EEA markets. Therefore, a GB manufacturer selling a safety component for lifts to the EEA or into Northern Ireland, who wishes to appoint an authorised representative to carry out tasks for them in respect of those products, must appoint an authorised representative based in Northern Ireland or the EEA.</p>

<p>An authorised representative must comply with all the duties imposed on the installer or manufacturer under the 2016 Regulations that they are appointed by the installer or manufacturer to perform. These include, in relation to lifts, the obligations to retain technical documentation and the declaration of conformity. The manufacturer or installer remains responsible for the proper performance of those obligations.</p>

<p>Any references in the 2016 Regulations to the manufacturer or installer are to be taken as a reference to the authorised representative, including in relation to penalties for failure to comply with those duties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Obligations of importers</h2>

<p>An importer is a person or business based in the UK who places safety components for lifts on the GB market from a country outside the UK. This means that UK businesses which used to act as a ‘distributor’ before the end of the transition period legally become an ‘importer’ if they place products from an EEA country on the GB market.</p>

<p>This includes safety components for lifts that are supplied to NI businesses from the EEA and then placed on the GB market. In this instance the NI business will take on importer obligations for EEA-supplied goods that are placed on the GB market (see also Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods).</p>

<p>Importers have additional legal obligations which go beyond those of distributors, such as checking that manufacturers have carried out the right conformity assessment procedures, and including their (the importer’s) name, registered trade name or mark and a postal address on the safety component or, where this is not possible, on its packaging or in accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>To assist with the transition, the UK is applying a transitional period ending 31 December 2022 to allow those GB operators who supply products from the EEA or Switzerland (who from 1 January 2021 are importers into the GB market) to provide their details on the packaging or in an accompany document as an alternative to placing them on the safety component itself. This applies to goods that are not qualifying Northern Ireland goods. For further detail on qualifying Northern Ireland goods, please see Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Can you be contacted easily if there is a problem?</h3>

<p>A key principle underpinning product safety, for the benefit of consumers and regulators, is traceability of a product back to its source.</p>

<p>In recognition that under the new regulatory regime you may have the new status of an importer when placing safety components for lifts from an EEA state or Switzerland on the GB market, you are temporarily permitted when placing such safety components on the market (until 31 December 2022) to indicate your name, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address on the safety component’s packaging or in a document accompanying the safety component, instead of on the safety component itself. As set out above, this is usually only permitted where it is not possible to provide the specified information on the safety component itself. This additional temporary easement is permitted until 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-7">See footnote 7</a></p>

<p>We understand that there may be a period of adjustment to the new arrangements for importer documentation for the GB market, and it may be difficult to provide your details on documentation accompanying each and every individual product.</p>

<p>You may therefore use an alternative method where, for example, your contact information is on a document accompanying a batch of products. This document would then follow each batch of products through the distribution chain. Your contact details must follow each product through the distribution chain, but not necessarily by one document per product. Ultimately, the end user, each distributor (and a regulator) must be able to access the information.</p>

<p>Methods which enable traceability of the product after the initial batch has been broken up could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The importer address is present in shipping documents.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the invoice to the GB customer.</li>
  <li>The importer address is present on the label that is on the outer packaging (“shipper”) in which a number of finished goods is packed (normally customers will receive shippers unless the order is very small so that the shipper has to be opened and split).</li>
  <li>The importer address is included on the EU Declaration of Conformity and/or UK Declaration of Conformity (whichever is relevant for the product in question).</li>
</ul>

<p>You should work with your distributors to ensure physical documentation does accompany batches of product as far as possible, and in all cases that there are measures in place to ensure end users are able to identify the UK importer.</p>

<p>Alongside that, but not as an alternative, you can use your company website to provide more information, access to product details and contact points for retailers, consumers and enforcement bodies.</p>

<p>These options are for a time limited period only and may not be used after 31 December 2022. You are encouraged to put in place measures to ensure that individual items do carry the importer’s address where required ahead of this date.</p>
</div>

<p>The EU does not have any such transitional provision. In the absence of this, lifts and components being sold from GB to NI or the EEA must be labelled with the NI or EU-based importer’s address. For further detail about placing on the NI market please see:</p>

  <li>An importer must not place a safety component for lifts on the GB market unless it is in conformity with the essential health and safety requirements.</li>
  <li>Before placing safety components for lifts on the GB market, an importer must ensure that the relevant conformity assessment has been carried out by the manufacturer; the manufacturer has drawn up technical documentation; the safety components for lifts are UKCA marked <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-8">see footnote 8</a> visibly, legibly, and indelibly and are accompanied by the declaration of conformity. They must also ensure that the manufacturer has complied with their obligations with regard to labelling and instructions. Until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to, or a document accompanying, the component.</li>
  <li>The importer must keep a copy of the declaration of conformity and where applicable any approval decision for a period of 10 years after the safety component has been placed on the GB market. They must also be able to make the technical documentation available to the enforcing authorities upon request.</li>
  <li>The importer must provide their name trade, registered trade name or registered trade mark and a postal address at which they can be contacted on the safety component, or where this is not possible, or where the importer has imported the safety component from an EEA state or Switzerland and places it on the GB market before 31 December 2022, on its packaging or in an accompanying document.</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that when placing a safety component for lifts on the GB market, it is accompanied by instructions and information in English which can be easily understood by the end user.</li>
  <li>When appropriate, having regard to the risks to the health and safety of end users presented by a safety component for lifts, the importer must carry out sample testing of safety components they import and must investigate complaints about safety components that are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulations and keep a register of those complaints. They must also keep distributors informed of any sample testing or investigation.</li>
  <li>The importer must take action where they have reason to believe that the lifts are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulations by bringing the lift components into conformity, withdrawing the components or recalling the components. Where the components present a risk, the importer must immediately inform the market surveillance authority, giving details of how the components are not in conformity and any corrective measures taken. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>The importer must also cooperate with and when requested provide information and documentation to enforcement authorities.</li>
  <li>The importer must ensure that while safety components for lifts are under their responsibility, their storage and transport conditions do not jeopardise their conformity with the essential health and safety requirements.</li>
</ol>

<p>Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may also be placed on the GB market. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Obligations of distributors</h2>

<p>UK businesses which were distributors of safety components for lifts within the EU single market should now consider whether they are importers from the EU single market and therefore what additional requirements they may face – see section 7 above. The same applies to distributors of goods from the other EEA countries and Switzerland.</p>

<p>A distributor is a person in the GB supply chain, other than the manufacturer or importer, who makes safety components for lifts available on the GB market.</p>

<p>The obligations of distributors include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When making a safety component for lifts available on the GB market, a distributor must act with due care to ensure that it is in conformity with the 2016 Regulations, which means the safety component must be in conformity with the essential health and safety requirements, amongst other requirements.</li>
  <li>The distributor must verify that the safety component bears a UKCA marking <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-9">see footnote 9</a>; is accompanied by the declaration of conformity and required documents; that it is accompanied by instructions; and that the importer and manufacturer have complied with their obligations as to required labelling. Until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to, or a document accompanying, the component, whatever the nature of the safety component.</li>
  <li>The distributor must not make available on the GB market a safety component for lifts unless they conform to the essential health and safety requirements.</li>
  <li>The distributor must take action where they have reason to believe that the lifts are not in conformity with the 2016 Regulations by bringing the lift components into conformity, withdrawing the components or recalling the components. Where the components present a risk, the distributor must immediately inform the market surveillance authority, giving details of how the components are not in conformity and any corrective measures taken. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/business-notifications-of-unsafe-and-noncompliant-products">Read more information on how to notify the MSA</a>.</li>
  <li>The distributor must ensure that while safety components for lifts are under their responsibility, their storage and transportation conditions do not jeopardise their conformity with the essential health and safety requirements.</li>
  <li>The distributor must cooperate with and provide information to enforcement authorities following any requests.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Transitional arrangements</h2>

<h3>Products placed on the market before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>If you placed an individual fully manufactured product on the EEA or the UK market (either in Northern Ireland or Great Britain) before 1 January 2021, you do not need to do anything new. These individual goods can continue to circulate on either market until they reach their end user and do not need to comply with the changes that took effect from 1 January 2021.</p>

<p>A fully manufactured good is ‘placed on the market’ when there is a written or verbal agreement (or offer of an agreement) to transfer ownership or possession or other rights in the product. This does not require physical transfer of the good.</p>

<p>You can usually provide proof of placing on the market on the basis of any relevant document ordinarily used in business transactions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contracts of sale concerning goods which have already been manufactured and meet the legal requirements</li>
  <li>invoices</li>
  <li>documents concerning the shipping of goods for distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>The relevant economic operator (whether manufacturer, importer or distributor) bears the burden of proof for demonstrating that the good was placed on the EEA or UK market before 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>Existing CE marked stock</h3>

<p>The UK will allow CE marked lifts and their components that have been either self-declared as compliant (where permissible) or where compliance must and has been demonstrated through assessment by an EU-recognised conformity assessment body (notified body) to be placed on the GB market until 31 December 2022.</p>

<p>Lifts and their components lawfully placed on the market with a CE marking by 31 December 2022 can continue to circulate on the GB market after this date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> UKCA Marking</h2>

<h3>Assessment through third-party organisations</h3>

<p>From 1 January 2021, lifts and components that are conformity assessed by a UK approved body should be UKCA marked, not CE marked. If the conformity assessment was carried out by a UK conformity assessment body and the CE marking was affixed to the fully made product before 1 January 2021, the CE marking can still be used, but the product must be placed on the GB market before 31 December 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="#footnote-10">See footnote 10</a></p>

<p>Where the component has been assessed by an EU notified body, manufacturers must continue to use the CE marking and can continue to place these products on the GB market until 31 December 2021. Qualifying Northern Ireland goods complying with the legislation as it applies in Northern Ireland, including affixing the CE marking, may be placed on the GB market after 31 December 2022. See further detail in Section 11 on Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods.</p>

<p>Rules around physically affixing the new UKCA marking mirror those which applied for the application of the CE marking, although until 31 December 2023, the UKCA marking may be affixed to a label affixed to the lift or component or a document accompanying the lift or component, rather than being affixed to the lift or component itself (even where it is otherwise possible to affix it to the lift or component itself).</p>

<h3>Testing Certificates</h3>

<p>Where conformity assessment is a 2-stage process, it is possible for safety components to have an EU-type-examination certification (1st stage) followed by a declaration by the manufacturer or third party of the production process under the responsibility of an approved body (2nd stage) until 31 December 2022. Such products should have the UKCA mark followed by the UK Approved Body Number.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukca-marking">Read guidance on UKCA marking</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods</h2>

<p>The government committed to providing unfettered access for qualifying Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK market after 1 January 2021. Products that can be placed on the market in Northern Ireland in accordance with the legislation, as it applies to Northern Ireland, can be sold in the rest of the UK without any additional approvals.</p>

<p>This means that products that are qualifying Northern Ireland goods can be sold in the rest of the UK if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the CE marking is lawfully applied to the good on the basis of self-declaration</li>
  <li>any mandatory third-party conformity assessment was carried out by an EU-recognised notified body (including a body in a country with which the EU has a relevant mutual recognition agreement) and a CE marking is affixed, or</li>
  <li>the certificate of conformity previously held by a UK approved body has been transferred to an EU-recognised notified body and a CE marking has been affixed</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be the case even if there are changes between the EU rules that the Northern Ireland Protocol applies to NI and the GB rules.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-the-ukni-marking">Read guidance on UKNI marking</a></p>

<p>NI businesses that are importing products from the EEA and placing them on the GB market must ensure that the relevant conformity assessment procedure has been carried out, that the technical documentation has been drawn up and that lifts and components bear the CE marking. They will also have to comply with the importer labelling duties (see Section 7 on obligations of importers).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Approved Bodies</h2>

<p>The UK has established a new framework for UK based bodies to assess products against GB rules. The existing active UK notified bodies have been granted new UK ‘approved body’ status and listed on a new UK database.</p>

<p>Approved bodies are conformity assessment bodies which have been approved by the Secretary of State to carry out the procedures for conformity assessment for the GB market as set out in the 2016 Regulations.</p>

<p>These approved bodies retain their 4-digit identification number. New approved bodies will be assigned a number by the Office for Product Safety and Standards on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Approved bodies can assess products for the UK market against GB essential requirements (which are, as yet, the same as EU essential requirements).</p>

<p>Approved bodies must be established in the UK and be independent of the manufacturer. Approved bodies must examine the technical documentation and supporting evidence in respect of a product to assess the adequacy of the technical design.</p>

<p>Where an approved body finds that essential safety requirements have not been met by a manufacturer, they must not issue a certificate of conformity and they must require the manufacturer to take corrective measures.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-market-conformity-assessment-bodies">View the register of UK Approved Bodies</a></p>

<p>The register also contains details of bodies in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America, which the UK is designating as Approved Bodies through Mutual Recognition Agreements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Enforcement and penalties</h2>

<p>In Great Britain, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk" rel="external">Health and Safety Executive</a> has a duty to enforce these Regulations in respect of lifts and safety components that are used in the workplace and the Secretary of State is responsible for enforcing these Regulations in respect of products for private use. The Secretary of State’s powers are exercised by the Office for Product Safety and Standards.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State may appoint a person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulations also provide powers to the Secretary of State to enforce RAMS (Regulation EC 765/2008 which sets out requirements for market surveillance of products), as amended by the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, in its application to lifts and safety components for lifts.</p>

<p>The 2016 Regulations provide powers to market surveillance authorities to take action to protect consumers, workers and users from the risks associated with unsafe lifts or safety components and can take action against economic operators that present a risk or are not in conformity with the Regulations. There are requirements on economic operators to co-operate with the enforcement authority as appropriate on request. GB market surveillance authorities will take all appropriate measures including to withdraw from the market or to prohibit and restrict the supply of products which may endanger the health and safety of persons and where appropriate to the safety of property.</p>

<h3>Regulators’ Code</h3>

<p>Market surveillance authorities must continue to have regard to the Regulators’ Code when developing the policies and operational procedures that guide their regulatory activities in this area. They should carry out their activities in a way that supports those they regulate to comply and grow, including choosing proportionate approaches that reflect risk.</p>

<p>In responding to non-compliance that they identify, regulators should clearly explain what the non-compliant item or activity is, the advice being given, actions required, or decisions taken, and the reasons for these. Unless immediate action is needed to prevent a serious breach, regulators should provide an opportunity for dialogue in relation to the advice, requirements or decisions, with a view to ensuring that they are acting in a way that is proportionate and consistent. The Secretary of State takes account of the provisions of both the Regulators’ Code and the Growth Duty in exercising his regulatory functions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulators-code">Read the Regulators’ Code</a></p>

<h3>Penalties</h3>

<p>A person committing an offence under the 2016 Regulations will be liable to a penalty. Penalties can include a fine or a prison sentence of up to three months for the most serious offences.</p>

<p>While it is matter for the enforcement authority to decide whether prosecution is appropriate in each case, should a prosecution take place, it is at discretion of the court to decide the penalties imposed on the offender.</p>

<span class="number">14. </span> Glossary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Approved Body</strong> – A conformity assessment body which has been approved by the Secretary of State or was previously a ‘notified body’ before 1 January 2021.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Authorised Representative</strong> – A person appointed in writing by a manufacturer to perform specific tasks for the manufacturer. From 1 January 2021, authorised representatives for the GB market must be based in the UK.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Declaration of conformity</strong> – A document prepared by the manufacturer which must detail, among other things, the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the specific safety component to which the declaration is referring</li>
      <li>the name and address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, their authorised representative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This must be kept by the manufacturer for a period of ten years from the date on which the safety component for lifts was placed on the GB market. This declaration must be made available to the enforcing authority upon request.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Enforcing Authority</strong> – In Great Britain, for lifts or safety components for lifts in the use in the workplace, this is the Health and Safety Executive. For lifts or safety components for lifts for private use this is the Secretary of State.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Importer</strong> – A person established in the UK who places a lift or components from a country outside of the UK on the GB market. A person who before 1 January 2021 (under EU Rules) distributed lifts or components within the EU (including the UK) will now be an importer if they are bringing a lift or components into GB from another country (including EU Member States). This includes a person based in NI who has been supplied with the product from an EEA country, who would, under NI law, be a distributor.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Manufacturer</strong> – A person who manufactures safety components for lifts or has them designed or manufactured and markets them under their name or trademark.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKCA Marking</strong> – The UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) marking is the new UK conformity marking used for certain goods (including safety components) being placed on the GB market, in place of the CE marking which is the conformity marking used in Northern Ireland and the European Union.</li>
  <li>
<strong>UKNI Marking</strong> (also known as the UK(NI) indication) – The UKNI marking is a new marking applied in addition to the CE marking, where a good requiring mandatory third-party conformity assessment has been tested against EU requirements by a UK body. The UKNI marking applies when placing such products on the Northern Ireland market. Under the Government’s unfettered access commitments, products lawfully marked with the UKNI marking can also be placed on the GB market if they are also qualifying Northern Ireland goods.</li>
</ul>
