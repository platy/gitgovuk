<h2>Delivering the Building the Right Support Action Plan</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-the-right-support-for-people-with-a-learning-disability-and-autistic-people/building-the-right-support-action-plan">Building the Right Support Action Plan</a> brings together, in one place, commitments across systems to reduce reliance on inpatient care in mental health hospitals for children, young people and adults with a learning disability and for autistic children, young people and adults by building the right support in the community.</p>

<p>This annex sets out the commitments that are set out in the action plan alongside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of key milestones</li>
  <li>timescales for delivery</li>
  <li>measures of success</li>
  <li>organisations accountable for delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>Some commitments appear more than once in the action plan where they are relevant to more than one chapter. If this is the case, we reference them only once in the table of commitments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Keeping people safe and ensuring high-quality health and social care</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We are determined to ensure that people with a learning disability and autistic people of all ages receive high-quality health and social care support, should they need it.</p>

<p>This support must prioritise safety and quality of life.</p>

<p>This means making sure that people are treated with dignity and respect, receive personalised care and treatment, and have opportunities to live an ordinary, independent life in their own home as part of the community.</p>
</div>

<p>To achieve this, chapter 1 of the action plan outlines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the importance of people’s voices being heard and having a clear plan for their care</li>
  <li>our expectations for health and social care services to provide high-quality care that keeps people safe from harm and abuse</li>
  <li>the ways we are tackling the inappropriate use of restraint, restrictive interventions and other poor practices in inpatient settings</li>
  <li>our ambition to build a health and social care workforce with the right skills, practice, leadership and culture, which empowers the workforce to provide the best possible care&nbsp;and support</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">2. </span> Making it easier to leave hospital</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>We want to support children, young people and adults who are ready to leave hospital to be discharged safely, in the right way and at the right time.</p>

<p>While treatment in a mental health hospital can sometimes be the right choice for a person who has a co-occurring mental health condition and would benefit from an intervention that can only be provided through inpatient care, we want to make sure that people who are ready to leave hospital are able to do so as soon as possible, with the right support ready in the community so that they can live in their own home.</p>
</div>

<p>To achieve this, chapter 2 of the action plan outlines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>our expectations for a plan to be developed with the person from the outset of their admission to support them to leave hospital when they are ready, involving their families and advocates where appropriate</li>
  <li>the ways we are aiming to reduce barriers to discharge, including undertaking regular reviews of people’s care and support, introducing reforms to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/20/contents" rel="external">Mental Health Act 1983</a> and providing financial support to make it easier for people to leave hospital</li>
  <li>the actions we are taking to reduce the number of people with a learning disability and autistic people detained under part III of the Mental Health Act</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview of commitments</h3>

<h4>Commitment 2a</h4>

<p>Working on a refresh of the <abbr title="Care (Education) and Treatment Review">C(E)TR</abbr> policy. The refreshed policy will have an increased focus on the physical health of people in hospital and include an increased emphasis on the importance of the actions that should follow from a <abbr title="Care (Education) and Treatment Review">C(E)TR</abbr>.</p>

<p>We want to ensure that children and young people with a learning disability, and autistic children and young people and their families can access the support they need to ensure they have the best possible start to life and can live the lives they choose.</p>
