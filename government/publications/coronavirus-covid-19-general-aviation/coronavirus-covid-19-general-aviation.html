<p>General Aviation (<abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr>) flying can take place. For example, flight training for all pilots, and flights with an instructor, can take place without limits.</p>

<p><abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> users should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">follow the government’s recommendations on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>When travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan your journey in advance. When travelling internationally, you must adhere to the government rules on international travel.</p>

<h2>International <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> flying and travel</h2>

<p>All international <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> flying and travel should follow the wider rules regarding international travel.</p>

<p>Read separate guidance on what you need to do to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel abroad from England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel to England from abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">travel to England from a red list country or territory</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england">take a COVID-19 test before travel to England</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk assessments</h2>

<p>Organisations need to regularly review their risk assessment to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate. The Health and Safety Executive encourages organisations to <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" class="govuk-link">identify measures in a priority order</a>. Risk assessments should take account of other risks and ensure controls implemented for COVID-19 do not increase risks due to other hazards.</p>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on working safely</a> and how this can be applied in the workplace. You will need to translate this into the specific actions depending on the nature of your business.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<p>In England, there is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face covering. The government suggests that you continue to wear a face-covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">Read separate guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<h2>Aerodromes and training organisations in England</h2>

<p>Steps that organisations should consider taking include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraging visitors to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises</li>
  <li>using online or telephone pre-booking systems, for example when booking flying lessons, and when booking an appointment, asking if customers can attend on their own, where possible</li>
  <li>encouraging customers to arrive at the time of their scheduled appointment or lesson</li>
  <li>informing customers of guidance about visiting the premises prior to, and at the point of arrival, including information on websites, on booking forms and in entrance ways</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test and trace</h3>

<p>You should assist the NHS Test and Trace service by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">keeping records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days</a> and providing data to NHS Test and Trace if requested.</p>

<h2>Training and flying instructors</h2>

<p>Flying instructors and support staff should be formally informed of the risks and all actions being taken to combat the risks. This is to ensure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the specific risks and mitigations</li>
  <li>understand site protocols</li>
  <li>are physically and mentally well enough to engage in a return to training</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be for individual training organisations to agree with their instructors any conditions for their return.</p>

<p>Cleaning is vital in all areas of training venues and aircraft. Training organisations should write and implement a cleaning plan.</p>

<p>It should ensure that all areas to be accessed by flying instructors, students and support staff are deep cleaned. This includes regular cleaning for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surfaces on board the aircraft</li>
  <li>all other areas accessed by students, instructors and support staff</li>
  <li>all frequently touched surfaces, for example, door handles, banister rails, buttons and toilet areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on working safely</a> and how this can be applied in the workplace. Each business will need to translate this into the specific actions it needs to take depending on the nature of the business and how it is operated, managed and organised.</p>

<p>Actions you could take include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">taking COVID-19 tests</a> - you cannot use these for international travel</li>
  <li>more frequent hand washing and surface cleaning</li>
  <li>disinfection of the aircraft (i.e. frequent touch points including headsets) and outside facilities to a standard which follows government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>
</li>
  <li>provision and use of hand sanitiser</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales</h2>

<p>This guidance refers to the guidelines that only apply in England. There may be information in this guidance that is useful for all individuals and businesses taking part in <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> activities to consider, but any <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> activities in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales must be carried out in a way that ensures that all COVID-19 rules and guidelines are complied with in those locations.</p>
