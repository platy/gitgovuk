<p>The government has announced that England will move to Plan B in response to the risks of the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>General Aviation (<abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr>) flying can take place. For example, flight training for all pilots, and flights with an instructor, can take place without limits.</p>

<p><abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> users should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">follow the government’s recommendations on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>When travelling within the UK, you should aim to do so safely and plan your journey in advance. When travelling internationally, you must adhere to the government rules on international travel.</p>

<h2>International <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> flying and travel</h2>

<p>All international <abbr title="general aviation">GA</abbr> flying and travel should follow the wider rules regarding international travel.</p>

<p>Read separate guidance on what you need to do to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-abroad-from-england-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">travel abroad from England</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">travel to England from abroad</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-list-of-countries-and-territories" class="govuk-link">travel to England from a red list country or territory</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">take a COVID-19 test before travel to England</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk assessments</h2>

<p>Organisations need to regularly review their risk assessment to ensure it remains relevant and appropriate. The Health and Safety Executive encourages organisations to <a rel="external" href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/working-safely/index.htm" class="govuk-link">identify measures in a priority order</a>. Risk assessments should take account of other risks and ensure controls implemented for COVID-19 do not increase risks due to other hazards.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on working safely</a> and how this can be applied in the workplace. You will need to translate this into the specific actions depending on the nature of your business.</p>

<h2>Social distancing</h2>

<p>Social distancing rules (2 metres or 1 metre with additional mitigations) apply at ports of entry between disembarkation and border control in order to manage the risk of variants of concern being transmitted between individuals and imported into the country.</p>

<p>This include areas in ports and airports wherever there are people travelling to the UK from outside the Common Travel Area (CTA) ahead of border control.</p>

<h2>Face coverings</h2>

<h3>On aircraft</h3>

<p>Passengers should wear a face covering when on board privately-operated aircraft in England.</p>

<p>People sharing piloting or flight crew duties don’t have to wear a face covering. However, face coverings are recommended to be worn by all individuals on aircraft, where social distancing is not possible, where it is safe to do so.</p>

<h3>In enclosed areas</h3>

<p>In England people must wear face coverings in enclosed and crowded spaces where they come into contact with people they don’t normally meet. Spaces can include local airports, aerodromes or on commercially operated aircraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own" class="govuk-link">Read separate guidance on face coverings</a>.</p>

<h2>Aerodromes and training organisations in England</h2>

<p>Steps that organisations should consider taking include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraging visitors to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities as they enter the premises</li>
  <li>if a port of entry, calculating the maximum number of visitors that can reasonably follow social distancing guidelines between disembarkation and border control, adjusting how people move through certain parts of the premises to reduce congestion (such as queue management or one-way flow)</li>
  <li>using online or telephone pre-booking systems, for example when booking flying lessons, and when booking an appointment, asking if customers can attend on their own, where possible</li>
  <li>encouraging customers to arrive at the time of their scheduled appointment or lesson</li>
  <li>informing customers of guidance about visiting the premises prior to, and at the point of arrival, including information on websites, on booking forms and in entrance ways</li>
</ul>

<h3>Toilets</h3>

<p>Public toilets, portable toilets and toilets inside premises should be made available for use and carefully managed to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Steps that will usually be needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency and to avoid touching your face, and to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available</li>
  <li>to enable good hand hygiene consider making hand sanitiser available on entry to toilets where safe and practical, and ensure suitable handwashing facilities including running water and liquid soap and suitable options for drying (either paper towels or hand driers) are available</li>
  <li>setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets, with increased frequency of cleaning in line with usage – use normal cleaning products, paying attention to frequently hand touched surfaces, and consider use of disposable cloths or paper roll to clean all hard surfaces</li>
  <li>let fresh air in, for example by fixing doors open where appropriate</li>
  <li>special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets and larger toilet blocks</li>
  <li>putting up a visible cleaning schedule and keep it up to date and visible</li>
  <li>providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test and trace</h3>

<p>You should assist the NHS Test and Trace service by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace" class="govuk-link">keeping records of customers, visitors and staff for 21 days</a> and providing data to NHS Test and Trace if requested.</p>

<h2>Training and flying instructors</h2>

<p>Flying instructors and support staff should be formally informed of the risks and all actions being taken to combat the risks. This is to ensure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the specific risks and mitigations</li>
  <li>understand site protocols</li>
  <li>are physically and mentally well enough to engage in a return to training</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be for individual training organisations to agree with their instructors any conditions for their return.</p>

<p>Cleaning is vital in all areas of training venues and aircraft. Training organisations should write and implement a cleaning plan.</p>

<p>It should ensure that all areas to be accessed by flying instructors, students and support staff are deep cleaned. This includes regular cleaning for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surfaces on board the aircraft</li>
  <li>all other areas accessed by students, instructors and support staff</li>
  <li>all frequently touched surfaces, for example, door handles, banister rails, buttons and toilet areas</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">guidance on working safely</a> and how this can be applied in the workplace. Each business will need to translate this into the specific actions it needs to take depending on the nature of the business and how it is operated, managed and organised.</p>

<p>Actions you could take include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests" class="govuk-link">taking COVID-19 tests</a> - you cannot use these for international travel</li>
  <li>more frequent hand washing and surface cleaning</li>
  <li>wearing a face covering, where it is safe to do so</li>
  <li>disinfection of the aircraft (i.e. frequent touch points including headsets) and outside facilities to a standard which follows government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">guidance for cleaning in non-healthcare settings</a>
</li>
  <li>provision and use of hand sanitiser</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations should make customers aware of, and encourage compliance with, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">limits on gatherings</a>.</p>
