<p>While there are huge benefits to being online to stay connected to family and friends during this period, the government recognises many parents feel concerned about the activities and content their children are accessing. This guidance outlines resources to help keep children safe from different risks online and where to go to get support and advice.</p>

<h2>Keep your child safe online</h2>

<p>It is important to have regular conversations about staying safe online and to encourage children to speak to you if they come across something worrying online.</p>

<p>Talk to your child about the importance of creating a safe online environment, including keeping any log-in details and passwords safe.</p>

<p>These resources will support you to talk to your child about a range of online safety issues, set up home filtering in a child-friendly way and set up age-appropriate parental controls on digital devices:</p>
