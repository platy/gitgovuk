<p>Whilst there are huge benefits to being online in order to stay connected to family and friends during this period, the government recognises many parents may feel concerned about the activities and content their children are accessing. This guidance outlines resources to help keep children safe from different risks online and where to go to receive support and advice.</p>

<h2>Keep your child safe online</h2>
<p>It is important to have regular conversations about staying safe online and to encourage children to speak to you if they come across something worrying online.</p>

<p>These resources provide guidance for parents and carers to keep children safe online. They will, amongst other things, support you to talk to your child about a range of online safety issues, set up home filtering in a child-friendly way and set up age-appropriate parental controls on digital devices:</p>

<h2>Child sexual abuse</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">

Receiving support through Prevent is voluntary, confidential and not any form of criminal sanction. If you need further help, you can also contact your local authority safeguarding team.</p>
