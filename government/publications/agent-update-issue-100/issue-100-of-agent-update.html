<h2>Technical Updates and Reminders</h2>

<h2>Tax</h2>

<h3>Decision tool and calculator for the 130% super-deduction and the 50% special rate (<abbr title="special rate">SR</abbr>) capital allowances</h3>

<p>HMRC have published an interactive tool to help companies check if they can claim for the super-deduction of up to 130% or the 50% special rate (<abbr title="special rate">SR</abbr>) first year allowances for qualifying expenditure on plant and machinery.</p>

<p>The tool is available in the HMRC customer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-can-claim-super-deduction-or-special-rate-first-year-allowances">guidance for super-deductions and <abbr title="special rate">SR</abbr> allowances</a>. It helps companies find out if expenditure on specific assets may qualify and calculates how much they may be able to claim.</p>

<p>Only companies can claim these allowances. The allowances are for qualifying expenditure on new and unused plant and machinery. They are for expenditure on or after the 1 April 2021 and up to 31 March 2023.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2021 to </span> 2022 Self Assessment (<abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr>) exclusions and specials documents</h3>

<p>We initially produced the documents to help software developers identify cases where customers should file a paper tax return rather than an online one, but the agent community have advised that these documents are also useful for them when dealing with clients’ sometimes complicated tax affairs.</p>

<p>The versions are 3.0 for exclusions and 2.0 for specials on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-technical-specifications-2022-for-individual-returns">Self Assessment technical specifications (2022)</a> page.</p>

<h3>Employer PAYE new recurring Direct Debit functionality</h3>

<p>HMRC will shortly introduce a recurring Direct Debit option for employers in line with its Payments Strategy, which ensures a consistent set of payment options are available to all customers.</p>

<p>Currently employers can set up a Direct Debit to collect a single payment, but not a recurring Direct Debit.</p>

<p>We had planned to make this service available in mid to late August 2022. However, to ensure we offer our customers the best possible experience, there have been some delays and we now expect it to be available in early October 2022.</p>

<p>Once the new service is available, there will be a new link which will allow employers to set up a Direct Debit via the employers’ liabilities and payments screens in the business tax account (<abbr title="Business Tax Account">BTA</abbr>). This will allow your clients to set up a recurring Direct Debit instruction (unless they cancel it), authorising HMRC to collect directly from their bank account based on their return submissions.</p>

<p>After an employer has set up a Direct Debit, the link will change to ‘Manage your Direct Debit’ and an employer will be able to manage the Direct Debit online.</p>

<p>Payments covered by Direct Debit will show within employers’ liabilities and payment screens for both employers and agents.</p>

<p>Only employers will be able to create, view, amend and cancel a Direct Debit.</p>

<h3>New powers for naming tax avoidance promoters</h3>

<p>To support taxpayers in steering clear or moving out of tax avoidance, HMRC publishes details on GOV.UK of those involved in the supply of mass-marketed tax avoidance schemes and details of the schemes they are selling.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers/current-list-of-named-tax-avoidance-schemes-promoters-enablers-and-suppliers">Current list of named tax avoidance schemes and promoters, enablers and supporters</a>.</p>

<p>To further support taxpayers, new legislation was introduced in Finance Act 2022 which enables HMRC to publish details of schemes they suspect are tax avoidance and to name suspected promoters earlier than previously possible. HMRC can now name connected persons including individuals involved in promoting tax avoidance such as directors, company officers and those behind these schemes. Publishing this information will help inform taxpayers about tax avoidance schemes being marketed and those that market them.</p>

<p>In August 2022, HMRC used these new powers for the first time to name two suspected tax avoidance promoters, as well as the directors of these companies. The new cases have been added to the existing list of promoters on GOV.UK and detail the legal powers that enabled publishing. More publications under this new power are planned and HMRC will update the list as cases progress.</p>

<p>The list is not a complete list of all tax avoidance schemes currently being marketed. Neither is it a complete list of all promoters, enablers and suppliers. There are other schemes, promoters, enablers and suppliers that HMRC cannot publish information about at this time.</p>

<p>HMRC provides a range of other tools for customers to help them steer clear of avoidance schemes, such as their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-are-at-risk-of-tax-avoidance?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">interactive tax risk checker</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-payslip-if-you-work-through-an-umbrella-company?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">payslip guidance if you work for an umbrella company</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/tax-avoidance-dont-get-caught-out?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_#the-nurse---tanyas-story">case studies on tax avoidance</a> demonstrating the risks of becoming involved in a tax avoidance scheme.</p>

<p>This information will help you and your clients identify tax avoidance schemes and those promoting them, so they do not get caught out.</p>

<h3>Spotlight 60 — warning for agency workers and contractors employed by umbrella companies</h3>

<p>Many umbrella companies are compliant with the tax rules, but some use contrived arrangements that claim to allow agency workers and contractors to keep more of their earnings. These arrangements are tax avoidance schemes and most of them do not work.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/warning-for-agency-workers-and-contractors-employed-by-umbrella-companies-spotlight-60">Spotlight 60</a> provides useful information that supports taxpayers in being able to better identify tax avoidance schemes used by umbrella companies. Spotlight 60 describes how these schemes are claimed to work and gives some warning signs to look out for. Also included is information on what taxpayers should do if they are worried about using a tax avoidance scheme or have concerns about being offered these kinds of pay arrangements.</p>

<p>HMRC provides a range of other tools for customers to help them steer clear of avoidance schemes, such as their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-are-at-risk-of-tax-avoidance?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">interactive tax risk checker</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-payslip-if-you-work-through-an-umbrella-company?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_">payslip guidance if you work for an umbrella company</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/tax-avoidance-dont-get-caught-out?&amp;utm_source=campaignpage&amp;utm_medium=refferal&amp;utm_campaign=upstream_#the-nurse---tanyas-story">case studies on tax avoidance</a> demonstrating the risks of becoming involved in a tax avoidance scheme.</p>

<p>This information will help you and your clients identify tax avoidance schemes and those promoting them, so they do not get caught out.</p>

<h3>Freeports update</h3>

<p>All English Freeports now have at least two tax sites designated, with a total of 21 tax sites now live across the 8 English Freeports.</p>

<p>As of 6 September 2022, 3 of the 8 Freeports also have a designated customs site with work under way to support the remaining Freeports to designate a customs site over the coming months.</p>

<p>Businesses within these tax sites will be able to benefit from tax reliefs including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relief from Stamp Duty Land Tax</li>
  <li>an enhanced 10% rate of&nbsp;structures and&nbsp;buildings&nbsp;allowance</li>
  <li>capital allowance of 100%</li>
  <li>rates relief</li>
  <li>employer National Insurance contributions relief</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also guidance for businesses on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/freeports">how to claim Freeport tax reliefs</a> available.</p>

<p>For more information on the tax and customs offer within Freeports, see:</p>

</ul>

<p>The Government remains committed to establishing 2 Green Freeports in Scotland, and at least one Freeport in each of Wales and Northern Ireland as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The bidding process for Green Freeports in Scotland closed in June 2022.</p>

<p>The Welsh Freeports bidding process was launched 1 September 2022 and will close 24 November 2022.</p>

<h3>Preparing for the new tax year basis&nbsp;— Income Tax&nbsp;Self Assessment</h3>

<p>The rules HMRC use to work out sole traders’ and partners’ profits for Income Tax in a Self Assessment return are changing for many businesses for the tax year 2023 to 2024 onwards.&nbsp;This may affect the return that they must submit by 31 January 2025. It will also affect subsequent returns.</p>

<p>Only taxpayers with an accounting date other than 31 March or 5 April are affected by this reform.</p>

<p>Under the new rules, from April 2024, businesses will be taxed on profits for the tax year and not, as now, the profits for the accounting year ending in a tax year.&nbsp;For the tax year 2024 to 2025 and future years where accounting years are different from the tax year end, the taxable profits will be worked out by apportioning the profits for the two accounting periods that straddle the tax year.</p>

<p>The tax year 2023 to 2024 is a transition year in which self-employed businesses will move to the new way of calculating taxable profits for the tax year. Businesses will need to declare the total profits from the end of the last accounting date in the tax year 2022 to 2023 up to 5 April 2024. This means that profits generated over a longer period will be taxable in the transition year. In the tax year 2023 to 2024, businesses can use any overlap relief resulting from overlap profit when the business first started. By default, any remaining additional profit can be spread over 5 years.</p>

<p>As an example, if a business’s accounting date is 31 December, they&nbsp;must declare profits from 1 January 2023 to 5 April 2024 (15 months rather than 12) in their tax return for the tax year 2023 to 2024, which is due by 31 January 2025.</p>

<p>The transition year 2023 to 2024 will present an opportunity for all businesses currently trading, regardless of accounting date, to use any overlap relief due.</p>

<p>From the tax year 2023 to 2024 onwards, some businesses might have to use provisional figures on their returns. More information about this will be available in due course.</p>

<p>Where a business’s accounting date is changed in the tax year 2022 to 2023, the current change of accounting date rules will apply. Where a business decides to change its accounting date from the tax year 2023 to 2024 onwards, these rules will not apply and a change can be made regardless of past&nbsp;changes.</p>

<h3>Economic Crime Levy for anti-money laundering regulated businesses</h3>

<p>The Economic Crime Levy (<abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr>) was introduced in Part 3 of Finance Act 2022 as part of the government’s plan to develop a sustainable resourcing model for economic crime reform.</p>

<p>September 2022 marks the halfway point in the first year of the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr>.</p>

<p>Individuals, partnerships (including <abbr title="Limited Liability Partnership">LLPs</abbr>) and companies who carry on an anti-money laundering regulated business at any point in a financial year and have UK revenue of at least £10.2 million, will need to pay the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr>. Each entity in a group that meets these conditions will have to pay the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> individually.</p>

<p>For UK resident entities, UK revenue is their turnover for the accounting period plus amounts not included in turnover which are recognised as revenue in accordance with GAAP. Revenue of any permanent establishment outside of the UK is excluded.</p>

<p>The definition of UK revenue for non-UK resident entities who are regulated for anti-money laundering purposes is at S57 Finance Act 2022.</p>

<p>The amount of <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> charged is determined by the entity’s UK revenue in the financial year:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">UK revenue</th>
      <th scope="col">ECL payment</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>below £10.2 million</td>
      <td>Nil</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more than £10.2 and up to £36 million</td>
      <td>£10,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more than £36 million and up to £1 billion</td>
      <td>£36,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>more than £1 billion</td>
      <td>£250,000</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The amounts for UK revenue and <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> payments are proportionally adjusted if an accounting period is other than 12 months, or an entity is regulated for only part of the financial year.</p>

<p>Payments must be made by 30 September following the end of the financial year to one of 3 collection authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Financial Conduct Authority</li>
  <li>the Gambling Commission</li>
  <li>HMRC</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the first payments will be due no later than 30 September 2023.</p>

<p>As many anti-money laundering regulated businesses are likely to have questions about the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> we are developing <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> guidance and will be publishing further information on GOV.UK soon. HMRC will continue to provide updates over the coming months.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can support your impacted clients by reminding them of the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr> and advising when payments for the 2022 to 2023 tax year are due.</p>

<p>Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/economic-crime-anti-money-laundering-levy/economic-crime-anti-money-laundering-levy#background-to-the-measure">background information to the <abbr title="Economic Crime Levy">ECL</abbr></a> is available in the Tax Information and Impact Notice at GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Capital Gains Tax on UK property account —  agent authorisation for digitally excluded customers</h3>

<p>HMRC have introduced a new process to allow agents to report and pay using the Capital Gains Tax (<abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr>) UK property disposal online service on behalf of clients who are digitally excluded.</p>

<p>The process is outlined below:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Agent is required to register with Agent Services unless they have an existing account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agent asks their client to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/capital-gains-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-employees-and-self-employed">contact HMRC</a> to register for a CGT on UK Property Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMRC adviser will confirm the client is digitally excluded and refer them to a Tax Technician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Tax Technician will follow the registration process which will result in the client receiving a CGT on UK Property Account reference. (CGT on UK Property Account Reference will be created in real-time.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client gives the CGT on UK Property Account reference to their agent to begin the agent-client authorisation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agent logs into Agent Services and selects ‘Ask your client to authorise you’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agent enters their client’s CGT Account reference, creating an invitation link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/capital-gains-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-employees-and-self-employed">contact HMRC</a> to request support to authorise their agent and provides their CGT on UK Property Account reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMRC advisor takes the callers details and makes a referral to the Extra Support Team advising the client will receive a call back within 48 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMRC Extra Support Service adviser calls the client and confirms they are happy for the agent to act on their behalf and creates the agent-client relationship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agent can engage digitally with HMRC on behalf of their client for CGT property disposals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The CG-APP18 Capital Gains Tax on UK Property Account Guidance will be updated.</p>

<h3>Are your clients liable for Plastic Packaging Tax — check if your client should register and prepare to submit their return and payment from 1 October 2022</h3>

<p>The new Plastic Packaging Tax (<abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr>) was introduced on 1 April 2022. If your clients manufacture or import plastic packaging into the UK, they may need to register for <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr>, submit a <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> return from 1 October 2022 and pay any tax due by 31 October 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/when-you-must-register-for-plastic-packaging-tax">Find out who the manufacturer or importer of plastic packaging is</a>.</p>

<p>Agents can apply to submit returns for <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> on behalf of their clients.</p>

<p>The return needs to cover the accounting period from 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022. If your client became liable for <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> after 30 June 2022, their return will only need to include information from the date they became liable for <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> to 30 September 2022.</p>

<p>Your clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must keep <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/record-keeping-and-accounts-for-plastic-packaging-tax">accounts and records</a> to support the information provided when they <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-your-plastic-packaging-tax-return">complete a quarterly <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> return</a>
</li>
  <li>accounts must show how they have worked out the figures they submit on their <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> return, and their records must show the evidence to support these figures</li>
  <li>must keep their accounts and records for at least 6 years from the end of the accounting period, and record weight in tonnes, kilograms, and grams</li>
  <li>will need to pay any tax due through their online <abbr title="Plastic Packaging Tax">PPT</abbr> account. They can pay via Direct Debit, BACs, CHAPS, Debit/Corporate credit card or Faster Payments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Student loans</h3>

<p>This article is for agents dealing with payroll</p>

<p>Employers are responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>actioning Student loan (<abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr>) and Postgraduate loan (<abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>) start and stop notices</li>
  <li>deducting <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> using the correct:
    <ul>
      <li>plan and loan type supplied by their employee</li>
      <li>thresholds and rates for the relevant loan and plan type</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>providing HMRC with details of the deductions in real time</li>
  <li>paying the <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions to HMRC along with tax and national insurance contributions</li>
  <li>giving employees details of the deductions on their wage or payslip, and P60 certificate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Many employers use Agents to manage their payroll — if this is you, then your role in ensuring <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> repayments are correctly processed is essential</h4>

<p>According to Real Time Information (<abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr>) data for the tax year 2021 to 2022, over 95% of employers and payroll agents accurately deduct <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> for employees and send this information to HMRC on employees Full Payment Submission (<abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr>) within the <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> submissions.</p>

<p>Although most get it right first time, there is still a small percentage who do not.</p>

<p>Common errors identified on <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions taken, despite HMRC sending a start notice</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> and <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr> deductions taken and recorded under the wrong loan or plan type</li>
  <li>deductions continuing after a stop notice has been issued</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips for getting it right</h4>

<p>If you are managing payroll on behalf of an employer, please ensure that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>action start and stop notices on the next available pay day from receipt</li>
  <li>always check the start notice, even if deductions are already being taken — this gives reassurance that you are taking deductions under the correct loan and plan type</li>
  <li>apply the relevant loan and plan type to the payroll — this can be found on the start notice, by asking the employee or by checking the starter checklist for new employees — if the employee does not know their loan or plan type, they can log into their Student Loans Company (<abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>) account</li>
  <li>apply the correct thresholds and rates for the relevant loan or plan type</li>
  <li>take extra care to ensure entries are recorded accurately on the employees <abbr title="Real Time Information">RTI</abbr> <abbr title="Full Payment Submission">FPS</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where you do not action the start or stop notice, or take deductions under the wrong plan type, HMRC will send a&nbsp;Generic Notification Service (<abbr title="Generic Notification Service">GNS</abbr>)&nbsp;message to you or the employers <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-online-log-in">Online PAYE account</a> as a reminder. We recommend you as the payroll agent register for email alerts for <abbr title="Generic Notification Service">GNS</abbr> messages. You can advise your client to do so as well, should you wish.</p>

<p>This ensures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>employees do not under or overpay their <abbr title="student loan">SL</abbr> or <abbr title="postgraduate loan">PGL</abbr>
</li>
  <li>HMRC sends the accurate deductions to the <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr>, which reduces the risk of unnecessary <abbr title="Student Loans Company">SLC</abbr> interest charges being charged to the employee and the balance remaining being up to date</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Tax Digital</h2>

<h3>Change in how customers tell us about errors on their VAT returns — new digital G-Form</h3>

<p>The new G-form is an online form and will be the default option landing page of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notification-of-errors-in-vat-returns-vat-652">Tell HMRC about any errors in your VAT Return</a> page on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>This is for all customers who wish to submit a VAT Error Correction Notice (<abbr title="Error Correction Notice">ECN</abbr>). Once submitted, a copy of the digital form will be captured into the Digital Mail Service (<abbr title="Digital Mail Service">DMS</abbr>) and processed as it is currently.</p>

<p>There will be no change to the way HMRC currently processes VAT Error Correction Notices.</p>

<h4>Benefits of the new G-Form</h4>

<p>The new G-Form will streamline the current process for customers, making it easier to tell us about errors on their VAT returns. It will enable customers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>upload supporting documentation</li>
  <li>provide explanatory notes</li>
  <li>save the form allowing them to complete it later</li>
  <li>receive a confirmation of submission with a reference number</li>
</ul>

<p>It also will help to reduce mistakes through built in validation and auto-calculations, and capture more complete information.</p>

<p>This will enable processing teams to work more efficiently, speeding up the processing time for the customer. It also means customers will not have to use paper, reducing printing costs.</p>

<h3>Agents Services Account (<abbr title="Agents Services Account">ASA</abbr>) — granular permissions</h3>

<p>HMRC are developing granular permission functionality in the Agent Services Account. This will allow agents to control who in their agency can access client records, with the option to opt in or out of using it. It is specifically aimed at supporting small to medium sized agents with up to 1000 clients.</p>

<p>The granular permission feature will be released as a private beta to a small group of the agents in September 2022 to test the new functionality. We are looking for participants to take part in the testing before it is released to the wider agent community.</p>

<p>As this is a private beta release, and not the final product, we encourage you to share with us any feedback regarding how the feature is working for you as part of the testing.</p>

<p>If you are interested in being part of the early release, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:mtdgpvolunteers@hmrc.gov.uk">mtdgpvolunteers@hmrc.gov.uk </a> stating your organisation’s name and agent reference number.</p>

<p>We are aiming to release the functionality to the wider agent community in October 2022.</p>

<h3>Making Tax Digital for VAT — make sure your clients are signed up</h3>

<p>All VAT registered businesses should now be using Making Tax Digital (<abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr>) compatible software to keep VAT records digitally and file their VAT returns to HMRC.</p>

<p>From Tuesday 1 November 2022, businesses that file their VAT returns monthly or quarterly will no longer be able to use their existing VAT online account to do so. This means they will need to use <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> compatible software to file their future VAT Returns.<br>
If you work with VAT registered businesses, please check they’re on track to do this, and if not, you can use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-tax-digital-for-vat-as-an-agent-step-by-step">step by step guide to sign your clients up to <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr></a> now.</p>

<p>If you or your clients do not sign up for <abbr title="Making Tax Digital">MTD</abbr> and file your VAT returns through this software, you may have to pay a penalty.</p>

<h4>Applying for an exemption from using software</h4>

<p>If you’re already exempt from filing VAT returns online or if you or your business is subject to an insolvency procedure, you’re automatically exempt.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-exemption-from-making-tax-digital-for-vat">check if you can apply for an exemption</a>.</p>

<h2>HMRC Agent services</h2>

<h3>HMRC app — new employment details</h3>

<p>The HMRC app has been updated to include new and improved employment details. Users of the app can quickly and easily get their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>income and employment history (going back 5 years)</li>
  <li>National Insurance number</li>
  <li>tax codes</li>
</ul>

<p>App users can also print and download their information and share it with their tax agent if needed. The app means there’s no need for you or your clients to call us for employment details, and it saves time in waiting for information to arrive in the post.</p>

<p>Please encourage your clients to use the HMRC app which is free to download from the App Store or Google Play.</p>

<p>Our YouTube video on how to confirm your employment details on the HMRC app shows how simple it is to get this information.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW9rksc5izk" rel="external">How do I confirm my employment details on the HRMC app</a></p>

<p>Once your client signs into the app for the first time, they can use facial recognition, their fingerprint or a 6-digit pin to get fast and secure access.&nbsp;The app is fully compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>) and was tested by range of people, including disabled users.</p>

<p>Other improvements to the app include paying your Self Assessment via your bank. To showcase the app functionality, we have created a series of ‘how to use the app’ videos on YouTube which covers how to make a Self Assessment, how to claim a tax refund and how to manage your tax credits.</p>

<h3>PIN activation letters</h3>

<p>The dispatch of PIN activation letters, which were requested by HMRC customers, was delayed between 26 July and 18 August 2022. This matter has now been resolved and the PIN activation letters have now been issued.</p>

<p>We apologise for the inconvenience.</p>

<h3>The Trust Registration Service</h3>

<h4>Deadlines for registering a trust with HMRC</h4>

<p>The deadline for registrations for most trusts on the Trust Registration Service was 1 September 2022. Any trusts who have not yet registered and are required to do so should register as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Trusts that need to register from 1 September 2022 must do so within 90 days.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/topic/personal-tax/trusts">Detailed information on registration deadlines for Trusts and Estates</a>.</p>

<p>No penalties will be charged for failure to register or late registration of a trust unless that failure is deliberate, in which case the trustee may be liable to a penalty of £5,000.</p>

<h3>Corporation Tax repayments</h3>

<p>HMRC have introduced a change to help Corporation Tax customers claim their repayment faster if they have waited for longer than 8 weeks since making their claim.</p>

<p>Following a successful trial, HMRC will now aim to respond to all progress chasing calls for Corporation Tax repayments within 1 working day where the customer has waited more than 8 weeks since submitting their claim. Corporation Tax advisers will escalate these cases to a technical adviser in real time.</p>

<p>Where a technical adviser is not available to respond in real time, the customer will be added to a list to be worked by a technical adviser within 1 working day.</p>

<p>This change particularly benefits customers and agents with complex cases and those who are in receipt of a high value repayment. This significantly reduces the number of times a customer or agent will have to contact HMRC to progress their Corporation Tax repayment claim.</p>

<h2>Agent forum and engagement</h2>

<h3>Agent Online Forum update</h3>

<p>The Agent Online Forum (<abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr>) provides a service for Agents to post and view queries, provide relevant evidence, suggest solutions, and access updates on potential systemic issues which may have a widespread impact on the operation of the tax system.</p>

<p><abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> staff provide and direct agents to where information is available, or where there is sufficient evidence of a systemic issue, obtain updates or responses from colleagues who are Subject Matter Experts (<abbr title="Subject Matter Experts">SMEs</abbr>) on the topic.</p>

<p>Professional bodies may also identify potential systemic issues that could be of high impact, and request prioritisation and escalation within HMRC to achieve resolution or an update on the item.</p>

<p>Escalated issues from the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> are monitored and progressed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/issues-overview-group">Issues Overview Group</a> (<abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr>), of professional bodies and Agents in practice, who prioritise and provide input on the resolution or outcome of escalations. Professional bodies can also highlight and seek progress on high priority issues, when engaging with HMRC board members in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/representative-body-steering-group">Representative Bodies Steering Group</a>. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agent-update-issue-98/issue-98-of-agent-update#agent-forum-and-engagement-1">process for posting, response, prioritisation, escalation, and review of an issue outcome</a>, is outlined in Agent Update 98.</p>

<h4>Issues Overview Group escalated issues</h4>

<p>Answers and the latest updates available on issues are published on the relevant Agent Online Forum (<abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr>) subject thread. Information available on the progression of the top issues, as prioritised by the Issues Overview Group (<abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr>), can be viewed in the <abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr> Escalated Issues section of the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr> met in August 2022 to review progress on outstanding escalated issues and to update prioritisation. MTDVAT Exemptions MTDVAT-16256, and the VAT Registration Service (<abbr title="VAT Registration Service">VRS</abbr>) VAT-18548, were the top issues on which updates and progress were sought by the <abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr>. A bespoke meeting on <abbr title="VAT Registration Service">VRS</abbr> is being arranged as a priority.</p>

<p><abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr>-9471 — <abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr> pre-population data  — Subject Matter Experts (<abbr title="Subject Matter Experts">SMEs</abbr>) updated the group on investigations around data flows in <abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr> pre-population, and the possible availability of additional online access to information in the coming months which will assist viewing of data, and queries by agents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr>-11680 — Linking emails to clients: <abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr> members met with HMRC Subject Matter Experts in August 2022 to provide updates and additional input on challenges tracking client forms. HMRC are seeking further input from colleagues to understand solutions that may be available.</p>

<p><abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr>-17269 — Transferring VAT Numbers: The <abbr title="Issues Overview Group">IOG</abbr> Agent in practice representative, who provided detailed evidence on transferring VAT numbers, outlined the background to date. Updates have been published on the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr>. Additional information on timescales is being sought.</p>

<p><abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr>-16038 — Tax Repayment Delays:&nbsp;Changes to process and guidance will ensure more <abbr title="Self Assessment">SA</abbr> advisers can release repayments where it is appropriate to do so. This change was implemented week commencing 25 July 2022, and other solutions are being tested to increase the number of repayments that can be made. This work area will continue to be monitored.</p>

<p>In seeking to improve the triage of enquires and follow up on responses, posts which at the outset do not clearly appear to be about a potentially systemic issue may be locked within 5 days.</p>

<p>Similarly comments which follow a response and do not contain additional new evidence can also be locked within 5 days. In both instances the feedback provided will be made available to <abbr title="Subject Matter Experts">SMEs</abbr> as insight on the topic.</p>

<p>Should Agents or Professional Bodies identify additional evidence on the topic in the future, they can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:agentforum.wt@hmrc.gov.uk">agentforum.wt@hmrc.gov.uk</a> requesting the thread to be reviewed and re-opened. HMRC may also re-open a post if there is new information or the outcome advised changes, for example introduction of new technology or new policy. This ensures the <abbr title="Agent Online Forum">AOF</abbr> is able to balance resources and increase effectiveness in triaging greater volumes and a wider range of queries from more agents. This will benefit the majority of users, avoiding disproportionate resources being used on providing multiple follow-on responses after the answer has been provided.</p>
