<p>We have updated this guidance with a minor formatting change on page 6.</p>

<h2>The Welsh Language Scheme</h2>

<p>This section tells HM Passport Office staff what to do when customers want to use the Welsh language in their dealings with us.</p>

<p>According to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/38/contents" rel="external">Welsh Language Act 1993</a>, public services in Wales must provide services in both English and Welsh.</p>

<p>HM Passport Office in Newport offers a Welsh speaking service at their public counter. This is only available from Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>If there is no Welsh speaking advisor, the customer can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>book an appointment for a Welsh speaking advisor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree to receive a call back in Welsh</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continue the conversation in English</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Application packs in Welsh</h3>

<p>Application packs in both English and Welsh are available from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Post Office Ltd</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adviceline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HM Passport Office customer service centre in Newport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Welsh on a passport</h3>

<p>Staff must follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the place and country of birth guidance when dealing with Welsh names</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the names guidance when applicants have a Welsh name that has a diacritical (mark or accent) character or have “Ap” before their surname</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Correspondence in Welsh</h3>

<p>Any customer communication received in Welsh must be replied to in Welsh.</p>

<h3>Telephone calls in Welsh</h3>

<p>When a customer calls the Adviceline, they must press the number 2 on their keypad for the call to continue in Welsh.</p>

<p>Customers who choose the Welsh service are transferred to a Welsh speaking advisor. If a Welsh speaking advisor is not available, the customer can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>agree to receive a call back in Welsh</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continue the call in English</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>How the CSMT deal with Welsh speaking calls</h4>

<p>When the Adviceline needs to transfer a call to the Customer Service Management team (CSMT), they will tell the customer the call will be translated using The Big Word.</p>

<p>When you, the CSMT agent, require a welsh translator, you must follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to complete a conference call for Big Word using A365</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interpreters</h3>

<p>We will arrange an interpreter for customers who tell us they need one to attend a passport interview appointment (and do not charge customers for using an interpreter). Teleperfomance (TP) will book official interpreters through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Big Word for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>sign language</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Welsh interpreter</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>TP and counter staff are not able to arrange sign language or Welsh language for interpreters for customers who attend a counter appointment.</p>

<p>If a customer attending a passport interview needs an interpreter, they cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have members of their family acting as an interpreter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>arrange to book their own interpreter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Interpreters for UK interviews</h4>

<p>Customers who need a sign language or Welsh interpreter must let us know when they make their appointment.</p>

<p>We will not pre-book interpreters before the customer attends a UK interview, unless the customer needs a sign language interpreter or a Welsh interpreter.</p>

<h3>Complaints in Welsh</h3>

<p>All complaints must be handled in line with the complaints handling guidance. If a complaint is received in Welsh, our complaints team will reply in Welsh.</p>

<h4>How to translate a reply into Welsh</h4>

<p>When the complaints handler has written a response in English, they will send it to their line manager for approval. You, the line manager, must:</p>

<p>1. Send the response in English by email to The Big Word, who will provide a quote to translate the response.</p>

<p>2. Email the quote to finance for approval.</p>

<p>3. Email The Big Word when the purchase order is confirmed, and ask them to prepare the translation.</p>

<p>4. Send the response, in Welsh, to the customer either by email or post, depending on the customer’s request.</p>
