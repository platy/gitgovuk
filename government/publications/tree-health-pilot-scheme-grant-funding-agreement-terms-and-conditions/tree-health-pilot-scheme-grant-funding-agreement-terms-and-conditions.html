<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Background and purpose of the grant</h3>

<p>1.1.	England’s trees are facing increasing threats from pests and disease. Healthy trees help tackle the impacts of climate change, provide wildlife habitats, clean the air we breathe and produce the food we eat. To reduce the impact of tree pests and diseases the Government are designing a future tree health scheme that will replace and expand the existing Countryside Stewardship Woodland Tree Health grants.</p>

<p>The future scheme will aim to build the resilience of England’s trees, woods and forests, mitigating and minimising the impact of pests and diseases, improving the capacity of our trees to adapt to changing pressures and enhancing the benefits trees provide for future generations</p>

<p>1.2.	The Tree Health Pilot will expand on support available through the existing Countryside Stewardship Woodland Tree Health grant by testing new ways to help people who own or manage trees, to keep trees healthy by stopping the spread of pests and diseases, and maintaining the treescape through resilient restocking after P&amp;D induced tree loss Learning generated through the pilot will be used to develop future incentives schemes for tree health.</p>

<p>1.3.	The Tree Health pilot is funded through <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>’s Future Farming and Countryside Programme and delivered in partnership with the Forestry Commission. The Tree Health Pilot delivers on the Agricultural Transition Plan 2020, supporting the commitment to the 25 Year Environment Plan, the Tree Health Resilience Strategy and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s carbon net zero goals.</p>

<p>1.4.	The pilot will be testing funding for two interventions:</p>

<p>(i) felling and treatment of diseased trees to slow the spread of pests and diseases and protect the wider treescape (including hire and purchase of infrastructure, capital items, site surveys and road closures to support this) and</p>

<p>(ii) restocking of trees for resilience to enable treescape recovery.</p>

<p>1.5.	Grants are available for people, including groups, who manage trees or woodlands affected by: ash with ash dieback, larch with Phytophthora ramorum, spruce growing in the high-risk spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) area, sweet chestnut with Phytophthora ramorum or sweet chestnut blight, in the following regions of England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>North West, primarily targeting Arnside and Silverdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Lake District National Park</li>
  <li>South East and London, primarily targeting Kent and East Sussex</li>
  <li>West Midlands, primarily targeting the Malvern Hills AONB and Shropshire Hills AONB.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Funded activities</h3>

<p>2.1.	<abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> will fund the following Capital Items and or Activities to fell, treat and restock trees, paid for as Standard Cost, at the relevant Intervention Rate, or Actual Cost as discussed more below and detailed in the <abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> Scheme Manual (see Annex 1).</p>

<ul>
  <li>felling diseased trees, which covers the basic costs of cutting down trees, which can then either be left to waste or removed unless there are specific felling/removal conditions associated with a public notice or other regulations. This felling can be either manual or by machine, as guided by the woodland officer for the circumstance. Where the SPHN explicitly requires destruction of the timber on site (for spruce with Ips typographus or sweet chestnut with sweet chestnut blight), felling can also include chipping and burning.</li>
  <li>chemically killing diseased trees</li>
  <li>restocking and capital items to replace trees that you’ve felled because they have pests or diseases – your restocking plans, for example the species and planting density used, must comply with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Forestry Standard (UKFS) and any felling licence conditions</li>
  <li>infrastructure and access aids, for example to improve access to trees, so you can fell and remove them</li>
  <li>biosecurity items to stop pests and diseases being transferred, for example a pressure washer to clean vehicles and equipment</li>
  <li>road closure costs and protected species site surveys, if you’re applying for ash with ash dieback only</li>
</ul>

<p>2.1.1.	Certain of the above items and activities will be payable on an Actual Cost basis as set out in the <abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> Manual referenced at Annex 1. For all Actual Cost Items, three independent and valid quotes for the work must be obtained by the Grant Recipient and submitted to the Authority, and the Authority in its sole discretion will select the most appropriate quote.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, applicants may be explicitly advised by the Woodland Officer to submit only one or two independent and valid quotes for the work. This will require specific agreement by the Authority prior to a grant application submission for such work.</p>

<p>2.1.2.	Certain of the above Capital Items and Activities will be payable on a Standard Cost Item basis, eg, for trees and tree protection as set out in the <abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> Scheme Manual (see Annex 1). An 100% Intervention Rate will apply to these Standard Cost Items, based on the national averages for those items.</p>

<p>2.1.3.	Intervention Rates will apply for all other Capital Items and Activities, meaning that the Grant payment will only covering a percentage of Actual Costs. The Intervention Rates are dependent on the type of Grant funded activity, individual or Group Application.</p>

<p>Felling and chemical treatment has an 80% Intervention Rate, permanent infrastructure items a 40% Intervention Rate, temporary access aids a 60% Intervention Rate. Biosecurity items has a 60% Intervention Rate for hired items and 40% Intervention Rate for permanent items as set out in the <abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> Scheme Manual (see Annex 1).</p>

<p>2.1.4.	Grant funding for restocking and Capital Items is subject to an overall cap of £5000 per hectare for ancient woodland sites and £3930 per hectare for other sites, this limits the amount that will be paid to any Grant Recipient. These items and limits are detailed in the <abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> Scheme Manual.</p>

<p>2.1.5.	Where a felling licence is required, felling actions funded in the pilot scheme must be compliant with the licence conditions. Funded Activities must also comply with any relevant outbreak notices, for example restrictions on the handling of felled spruce within the demarcated area. It is the Grant Recipient’s responsibility to stay up to date and ensure compliance with any outbreak notices.</p>

<p>2.2.	<abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> will also fund Maintenance Payments payable in annual instalments for three (3) years following the restocking of trees, as detailed more in Annex 2B.</p>

<p>2.3.	<abbr title="Tree Health Pilot">THP</abbr> will also fund Lead Facilitator Payments which apply to Group Applications only and are paid to the Lead Facilitator to cover the costs of their activities in acting as Lead Facilitator and coordinating a Group’s Funded Activities.</p>

<p>The rate of £20 per hour is payable and is capped at £3500 per month, but in the aggregate over the duration of the Grant, the amount payable shall be no higher than the total award payment to the Group.</p>

<p>Please note that Lead Facilitator payments are subject to the Authority’s powers under clause 24 of this Grant Funding Agreement, including an assessment by the Authority as to the satisfactory progress of the Funded Activities.</p>

Any part of the Grant Recipient’s application that is for land not within England is not eligible for funding under the Grant Funding Agreement;</p>

<p>5.1.2.	The minimum value of a Grant application must be £500.</p>

<p>5.1.3.	the Land subject of the Grant is not subject to grant funding from other sources for the Funded Activities at the time of the Commencement Date;</p>
