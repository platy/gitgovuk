<p>These statistics show the latest number of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) items which have been distributed for use by health and social care services in England by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>).</p>

<p>In publishing this data, we aim to provide a regular summary for ministers, policy makers and external stakeholders on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> intends to release these statistics weekly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>In the 7 days to 31 January 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> distributed over 289 million <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for use by health and social care services in England through the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel, NHS Supply Chain and other routes<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since 25 February 2020 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has distributed over 7.9 billion <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items for use by health and social care services in England in this manner. This includes over 337 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> authorised for release to designated wholesalers for onward sale to GPs (40 million), adult social care providers (258 million), community pharmacies (1.2 million) and dentists (38 million), as well as over 234 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to local resilience forums. Since 14 September 2020 over 81 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> have also been distributed to local authorities that no longer use local resilience forums<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link">[footnote 2]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This compares with approximately 2.43 billion items distributed between 1 January and 31 December 2019 to all NHS trusts and some social care organisations. This figure is a partial snapshot of the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> used in the system before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The NHS Supply Chain has since been expanded to 58,000 different settings, including care homes, hospices and community care organisations.</p>

<p>The current reporting system has been in place since 25 February 2020. It is estimated that between 1 January and 24 February 2020, approximately 326 million items of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> were distributed. This data was collected before the current reporting system was in place, so data quality is uncertain. For further detail see <a href="#table-2" class="govuk-link">table 2</a>.</p>

<p>The data includes all types of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, items that are critical for infection control<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup> and a small number of other fast-moving items<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. These items were made available through NHS Supply Chain during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic because there was a significant increase in usage. Some of these items were not available through NHS Supply Chain in 2019.</p>

<p>Unless specified, all items are counted individually<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. For example, gloves are not counted as pairs and are delivered in boxes of 200 as single items. Clinical procedures may use 1, 2 or 4 gloves at a time.</p>

<h2>Measuring the data</h2>

<h3>How the data was collected</h3>

<p>The data was collected from management information provided by Supply Chain Coordination Limited (NHS Supply Chain) since 25 February 2020. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> receives this data daily from NHS Supply Chain which since April 2020 have been compiled by Clipper.</p>

<p>Since April 2020 all products are distributed by Clipper and stored in a central warehouse in Daventry before delivery. Prior to April 2020 some items were distributed from the NHS Supply Chain Regional Distribution Centres.</p>

<p>The data is reported by the date of delivery. This covers all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items delivered within a 24-hour window from 2am on the date in question to 2am the next day.</p>

<p>Items are sometimes recalled, such as when they are faulty or do not meet set criteria. The figures presented are a combination of the number of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> items distributed minus those recalled and credits for stock that was processed through the system but unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Consequently, some days have negative delivery of items. Some items which have been recalled may still feature in the data as they are yet to be removed.</p>

<p>The data is not a measure of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> use as some items may not be used, while reusable items may be used multiple times.</p>

<p>The figures in this bulletin may differ from those previously quoted due to differences in start date and inclusion of items in the definition of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>The data covers <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distributed for use by health and social care services in England only.</p>

<p>The data includes deliveries from the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> Dedicated Supply Channel to organisations such as NHS trusts, National Supply Distribution Response, local resilience forums, local authorities and wholesalers for onward distribution and use by health and social care providers. These organisations may also procure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> through other routes, so this data does not constitute all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> available to NHS trusts, social care and primary care providers.</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>

<p>These statistics have been put together by the Department for Health and Social Care with advice from NHS Supply Chain and the Office for National Statistics on this approach.</p>

<p>More information on quality and how this publication adheres to the Code of Practice for Statistics is available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppe-delivery-statistics-statement-of-compliance-with-the-code-of-practice-for-statistics" class="govuk-link">statement of compliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Future development</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> intends to release these statistics weekly while they remain relevant to the government’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>The timeline below provides an indication of key developments in <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>’s understanding of this data.</p>

<h2>Experimental statistics</h2>

<p>Given the commitment of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to be open and transparent with the public it serves, this data is being released as experimental statistics. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has received requests for data on the distribution of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, such as Parliamentary questions, Freedom of Information requests and other queries.</p>

<p>This data is experimental statistics that are in the testing phase and not yet fully developed. These figures have not been used for statistical purposes before.</p>
