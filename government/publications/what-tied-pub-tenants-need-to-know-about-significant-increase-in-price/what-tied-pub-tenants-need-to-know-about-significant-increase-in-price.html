<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>When might there be a significant increase in price?</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Part 1 of the Pubs Code (Regulations 3 to 6)</p>
</div>

<p>If you have received an invoice showing an increase in the unit price of a tied product or service from the last time it was invoiced, it may be a <strong>significant increase in price</strong> under the Pubs Code.</p>

<p>When comparing unit prices, you must exclude VAT (Value Added Tax) and excise duty and disregard the effect of any discounts which the POB was not contractually required to give you.</p>

<p>The Pubs Code sets out the calculation to work out if the price increase is of the required level to be considered significant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What does a significant increase in price allow me to do?</h2>

<p>A significant increase in price under the Pubs Code gives you the right to ask your pub company for <strong>either or both</strong> of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a rent assessment - which begins with a Rent Assessment Proposal (RAP) for a new tied rent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a Market Rent Only (MRO) option - to rent your pub on a free-of-tie basis</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A significant increase in price is one of four gateways to request a MRO option - called ‘MRO events’. Note: it is not a MRO event if the price increase was reasonably foreseeable when the tenancy or licence was granted or when any last rent assessment was concluded.</p>

<p>There are strict time limits for sending a MRO notice or requesting a rent assessment.</p>

<p>The pub company must receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your request for a rent assessment within <strong>14 days</strong>, starting the day you receive the invoice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your MRO notice within <strong>21 days</strong>, starting the day after you receive the invoice</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How do I calculate if there has been a significant increase in price?</h2>

<p>The Pubs Code sets out how to calculate whether a price increase in a tied product or service is a <strong>significant increase in price</strong>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>The Calculation</h3>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Significant increase in price calculation" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/146600/Untitled_design__3_.png"></div></figure>

<ul>
  <li>A: The amount the products or service would have cost you last year in the comparison period if you had been invoiced at the current period prices</li>
  <li>B: The amount the products or service actually cost you in last year’s comparison period</li>
  <li>C: The relevant annual percentage change in the consumer price index (where that is negative, use zero)</li>
  <li>X: Set out in the Code and differs depending on the product or service type. Please see page 8 below</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Step by Step Guide to calculating if there has been a Significant Increase in Price</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Step 1: Work out the ‘current period’ (this year)</h3>

<p>Look at the invoice showing the price increase in the tied product or service. Work out the period four weeks before that invoice (ending with the day it was issued).</p>

<p>This four-week period is called the <strong>current period</strong>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Step 2: Work out the ‘comparison period’ (last year)</h3>

<p>Work out the four-week period last year, which <strong>starts</strong> with the day 12 months before the day the relevant invoice was issued.</p>

<p>This four-week period is called the <strong>comparison period</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>If you received the relevant invoice before 1 April 2022:</strong></p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The Pubs Code was amended from 1 April 2022, which included a change to the comparison period. If you received the relevant invoice before 1 April 2022, the four-week period last year <strong>ends</strong> with the day 12 months before the day the relevant invoice was issued.</p>
</div>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>There can only be a significant increase in price under the Pubs Code if you were invoiced for the same product or service in both the comparison period and the current period.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Step 3: Identify the product or service category</h3>

<p>Identify which category the relevant tied product or service belongs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beer</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Alcoholic drink other than beer</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Products other than alcoholic drink</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Services</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Step 4: Work out A and B in the calculation</h3>

<p>List all the tied products or services within the same category identified at Step 3 that were invoiced in the <strong>comparison period</strong>. Then also note the <strong>quantities</strong> invoiced.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Only include</strong> the product or service if it’s supplied under a tie. For example, beer supplied under the tie and not all beer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consider products or services separately</strong> from each other within the same category where invoiced under different names or in different units (such as size or capacity) and/or in different packaging (such as bottles and cans).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exclude</strong> from your list any product or service not invoiced in the current period under the same name and unit. For example, if a product has the same name but was invoiced in the current period in a different unit, you must exclude it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Calculate A</h4>

<ul>
  <li>find the current period price for each item in the list by looking at the last time that product or service was invoiced during the current period</li>
  <li>note the price excluding VAT and excise duty and disregard the effect of any discounts which the POB was not contractually required to give you</li>
  <li>work out the amount that the relevant product or service would have cost you over the comparison period if invoiced at the current period price</li>
</ul>

<h4>Calculate B</h4>

<ul>
  <li>add up what the relevant product or service actually cost you over the comparison period</li>
  <li>when noting the prices, as with the current period price, you must exclude VAT and excise duty, and disregard the effect of any discounts which the POB was not contractually required to give you</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Step 5: Work out the % increase between A and B</h3>

<p>Work out the percentage price increase between A and B (calculate A minus B, divide the answer by B, then multiply the answer by 100).</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>1740 (A) – 1700 (B) = <strong>40</strong></p>

<p>40 ÷ 1700 (B) = <strong>0.0235…</strong></p>

<p>0.0235 x 100 = <strong>2.35%</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>Step 6: Check the Consumer Price Index to find C in the calculation</h3>

<p>Find out the annual percentage change in the consumer price index. This is published by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

<p>Take the change most recently published before the day the relevant invoice was issued. This % change is C in the calculation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Step 7: Add C to X in the calculation</h3>

<p>Add the % from Step 6 (C in the calculation) to the following % (X in the calculation) according to the product or service:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Tied Product/Service</th>
      <th scope="col">X =</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Beer</td>
      <td>3%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other Alcoholic Drinks</td>
      <td>8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-alcoholic products or services</td>
      <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>If the % change in the consumer price index is 5% and the tied product is beer:</p>

<p>5% (C) + 3% (X) = <strong>8%</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>Step 8: Check whether the % price increase reaches the required level</h3>
<p>For a significant increase in price, the % price increase calculated at Step 5 needs <strong>to exceed</strong> the increase calculated at Step 7.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Step 5 = <strong>2.35%</strong></p>

<p>Step 7 = <strong>8%</strong></p>

<p>As 2.35% does not exceed 8%, in this example there is <strong>not</strong> a significant increase in price.</p>
