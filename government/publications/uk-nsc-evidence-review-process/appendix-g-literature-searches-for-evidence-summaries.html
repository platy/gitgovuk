<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Literature search process</h2>

<p>The literature search process for a UK NSC evidence summary should always follow a systematic approach.</p>

<p>A high quality literature is an essential element of a successful rapid review.  For a UK NSC evidence summary, the aim is to identify the relevant published literature based on the agreed questions and, in the interests of transparency, report the search strategy as an integral part of the review document..</p>

<p>See appendix H for further details on the requirements for a UK NSC rapid review.</p>

<p>A minimum of three databases should be searched and the search process must be documented fully.  This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>details of all strategies run in all databases including the number of results for each line and a total after limits have been applied</li>
  <li>the date the searches were run on</li>
  <li>the date limits for the searches</li>
  <li>number of duplicates removed</li>
  <li>details of any sifting the information scientist has carried out (may not be relevant to those reviews where the reviewer has carried out the search themselves)</li>
  <li>number of references remaining after sifting by the information scientist</li>
  <li>a flow diagram of the initial sifting process and details of how the studies were scanned and appraised for inclusion or exclusion  should also be included here if this first sift was carried out by the information scientist</li>
  <li>limitations of the search will need to be acknowledged, reiterating that it is for a rapid review and not a full systematic review</li>
</ul>

<p>This must be included in an appendix at the end of the review if appropriate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Literature searching for a rapid review</h2>

<p>Whichever method is used for searching the literature, it should be carried out systematically, and the basic principles of constructing a search strategy should be followed.</p>

<p>Search strategies are designed by focusing on the questions identified during the scoping process for the review and these are framed around the UK NSC appraisal criteria.  The number of questions may vary and this can depend on whether a new topic is being reviewed or if a previous review is being updated.  If this is for a new topic then an overview of several criteria may need to be investigated whereas an update to a previous UK NSC review may include fewer questions.  .</p>

<p>The scoping stage of the review is extremely important. It is necessary to be very clear about the scope of the review. This is true for any search of the literature but is especially important if there is limited time in which to carry out the search and sifting of results. The clearer and more focussed the search questions are, the easier it will be to design an accurate search strategy and retrieve only the most relevant results for the review.</p>

<p>During this stage, key papers should be identified. This might be through a preliminary search of the Cochrane Library or those identified from the previous review. This is useful for background reading, establishing the direction of the review and for quality assuring any search strategy designed.</p>

<p>The scope of the review should be discussed, clarified and documented including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type of review required</li>
  <li>key questions the review hopes to answer</li>
  <li>definition of the condition and markers used for testing</li>
  <li>populations included – defined by sex, age, socio-demographic or medical characteristics etc</li>
  <li>specific inclusions and exclusions relating to all aspects of the criteria included</li>
  <li>the screening criteria that will be addressed, for example, those not adequately met in the previous review”</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the scoping discussions, the previous review, the type of review required and the background reading, clear review questions should be formulated.  This provides the basis of the literature search.</p>

<p>For the purposes of a UK NSC rapid review the headings from the criteria for appraising the viability of a screening programme should be used in combination with PICO principles.  This identifies the key questions for the review and informs the design of the search strategy.  The criteria address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the condition (prevalence, morbidity and mortality, natural history)</li>
  <li>the test (acceptability, validity, accuracy, availability)</li>
  <li>the treatment (is there an established treatment?, does early intervention in an asymptomatic population improve outcomes?)</li>
  <li>the screening programme (are there any RCTs?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The starting date for the search should be taken from the date of the search from the previous review. If this is not possible, for example if a fully documented search  was not  carried out or if this is a first review of a new topic, a Cochrane Review, Health Technology Assessment or other good quality systematic review may be used as a starting point. In all cases the start of the search date range should be discussed and agreed as part of the commissioning stage of the review project.</p>

<p>Once the focus of, and questions for, the review have been refined and the date range agreed the most appropriate strategy for the search can be chosen and designed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Practical considerations and pointers</h2>

<p>Approaches to searching used in rapid reviews have highlighted the need to adapt the type of search for each review.  Discussion has focused on finding limitations which are acceptable to the review in question.   The main principle is that the search strategy should be agreed beforehand, justified, and described fully.</p>

<p>In order to design a strategy for a rapid review, a number of methods can be used to limit the number of references retrieved and therefore cut down the time needed for the literature search. However, the process should still be carried out systematically and details of all stages should be documented and reported in the final review.</p>

<p>The balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the search will need to be considered along with other factors. A more sensitive search may be useful in some circumstances, but the number of results can be limited, for example, by applying filters for a particular study type. A more specific search will retrieve fewer results but will be more useful when answering very specific questions. Filters may also be useful when trying to answer very specific questions about conditions for which there is a lot of research published.</p>

<p>Limiting to certain types of study can be done in a variety of ways, either by using a database such as the Cochrane Library, or by using filters in other types of databases. It is difficult to provide a generic overview of the levels of evidence that will be considered for each review. However, significance of different types of evidence will follow a generally accepted hierarchy, for example, hierarchy of evidence:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses</li>
  <li>RCTs with definitive results (confidence intervals that do not overlap the threshold for a clinically significant effect).</li>
  <li>RCTs with non-definitive results (a point estimate that suggests a clinically significant effect but with confidence intervals overlapping the threshold for this effect)</li>
  <li>Cohort studies</li>
  <li>Case-control studies</li>
  <li>Cross sectional surveys</li>
  <li>Case reports</li>
</ol>

<p>Using filters will also add limitations to your results and a number of sources of search filters that have been validated are available.</p>

<p>Consider narrowing the search parameters, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>restrict the search to only include the specific population covered by the review</li>
  <li>don’t include tests that may be of a wider interest but are not necessarily relevant to  the focus of the review</li>
  <li>restrict populations by geographical area to ones that could be considered similar to the UK, for example, Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand</li>
  <li>limit the number of times the search is quality assured / peer reviewed and the number of times the search is refined</li>
  <li>limit consultation with other information specialists</li>
  <li>limit the number of databases searched, UK NSC rapid reviews recommend a minimum of three (eg Medline, Embase, Cochrane as appropriate) to ensure a reasonable level of assurance that relevant papers have not been missed</li>
  <li>date limits should be based on the previous review’s search dates</li>
  <li>if a good quality systematic review or HTA has been carried out on the condition and question being reviewed, then this may provide an appropriate starting point and help limit the number of results retrieved</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider limiting or omitting labour intensive techniques such as handsearching and appraisal of the papers</p>

<p>Further exclusions at this stage, which may help in limiting the number of results retrieved, might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-English abstracts</li>
  <li>non-English language studies with English abstracts</li>
  <li>conference abstracts</li>
  <li>Cochrane protocols and withdrawn Cochrane reviews</li>
  <li>case reports</li>
  <li>animal studies should always be excluded</li>
</ul>

<p>Searches may need to be re-run before the final review is published for consultation if there is a significant delay between the initial search being carried out and publication. Could be for a variety of reasons, but will ensure that the evidence used to inform the review is the most up-to-date. However, for rapid products this should not be an issue due to the nature of the review.</p>
