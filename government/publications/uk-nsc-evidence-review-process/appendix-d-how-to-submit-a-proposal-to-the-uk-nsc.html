<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Before you submit a proposal</h2>

<p>Consider whether you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proposing a new topic</li>
  <li>requesting an early update for a topic</li>
  <li>suggesting a modification to an existing screening programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the UK NSC’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://legacyscreening.phe.org.uk/screening-recommendations.php" rel="external">list of recommendations</a> to determine the current status, if any, of the topic.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Proposing a new topic</h3>

<p>All proposals for a new screening topic must be made using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8eopFA9myQeRjJvb1RmRmJScHM?usp=sharing" rel="external">template submission form</a>.</p>

<p>Submissions can only take place during the annual call for new topics, which will be promoted in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://phescreening.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external">PHE Screening blog</a>. Topics submitted after midnight on the date of the deadline will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The whole process is likely to be lengthy due to the time needed for a thorough evaluation.</p>

<p>Using the submission form you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>explain your proposal and why the topic is within the remit of the UK NSC in up to 200 words</li>
  <li>summarise the condition, the test and the treatment in up to 500 words</li>
  <li>highlight whether there has been a randomised controlled trial showing benefit from screening</li>
  <li>provide up to 10 references to support your application</li>
  <li>include a flowchart</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Requesting an early update for a topic</h3>

<p>These can be submitted at any time. Before you start you should check that the review has not already started.</p>

<p>You will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specify which topic you wish to be considered</li>
  <li>explain in up to 500 words why it should be looked at early</li>
  <li>provide up to 10 references to support your application</li>
</ul>

<p>Your justification will need to highlight how the UK NSC criteria would be altered by the new evidence you have submitted and how this would affect the overall recommendation. An early update will only be carried out where it is likely that the final recommendation would be changed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Suggesting a modification to an existing screening programme</h3>

<p>These can be submitted at any time. The whole process is likely to be lengthy due to the time needed for a thorough evaluation.</p>

<p>You will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>specify the programme your proposal relates to</li>
  <li>explain the modification you are suggesting in up to 200 words</li>
  <li>summarise the impact on the whole screening pathway in up to 500 words; this could include identifying new types of abnormality or incidental findings or revised cost effectiveness</li>
  <li>provide up to 10 references to support your application</li>
  <li>include 2 flowcharts, one for the existing programme and the other showing the changes being proposed</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Writing your proposal</h2>

<p>Make sure you provide the correct information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8eopFA9myQeRjJvb1RmRmJScHM?usp=sharing" rel="external">template submission form</a> and that you keep to the specified word limits. Writing a good proposal is challenging so give yourself enough time to do it properly. You may want to speak with colleagues and experts in the topic area. Make sure there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes in your proposal that could distract from the content.</p>

<p>You should write your proposal so that it can be understood by someone who does not have expertise in the particular topic area. Try to avoid abbreviations and acronyms, or define them when first used. Technical jargon should be avoided.</p>

<p>Published peer reviewed evidence is essential to support the submission. All the information provided should be based on the referenced publications. References must be papers published in peer reviewed journals, specifying authors, title, journal, issue number and year of publication.</p>

<p>Submissions without strong supporting references will need to present a compelling case on the basis of more limited evidence.</p>

<p>Levels of evidence that make strong recommendations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>systematic reviews</li>
  <li>randomised controlled trials</li>
  <li>population-based studies</li>
  <li>test accuracy studies with consecutively enrolled or randomly selected samples from the target population</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.casp-uk.net/#!casp-tools-checklists/c18f8" rel="external">CASP website</a> discusses these evidence types, and offers checklists to appraise them.</p>

<p>Balanced, impartial information should always be provided, highlighting both the benefits and harms of screening. Gaps and limitations in current evidence should also be highlighted if necessary.</p>

<p>A flowchart, where requested, should act as a graphical representation of the process from identifying the eligible population to the outcomes of the screening programme; an example is provided in Appendix E which should be used as a model. As a minimum, it should include the number of people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accepting / declining screening</li>
  <li>testing positive / negative / uncertain</li>
  <li>receiving treatment</li>
  <li>helped / unaffected / harmed by the programme</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Submitting your proposal</h2>

<p>Send your completed recommendation to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:UKNSC.AnnualCall@phe.gov.uk">UKNSC.AnnualCall@phe.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>We will get back to you within 10 weeks of the annual call closing and inform you of the progress of your proposal.</p>
