<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Summary</h2>

<p>Stakeholder involvement is important to the UK NSC as it provides opportunities for stakeholders to raise issues of concern to them and broadens the range of perspectives on a given topic.  Because of this, stakeholder involvement can contribute to more informed decision making.</p>

<p>The processes described in this document are intended to provide practical and regular points of input right across the UK NSC evidence review process and to establish a structure for ongoing engagement across a range of disease areas and a large number of conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Details</h2>

<p>A patient or professional group can be a stakeholder organisation if it works at a national level (covering the UK or any of the individual UK nations), or is a UK branch of an international body, and represents patients, carers or healthcare professionals either broadly or directly related to the recommendation under consideration.</p>

<p>Stakeholder organisations are invited to participate in the UK NSC evidence review process. They include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>national groups representing patients and carers</li>
  <li>organisations representing healthcare professionals</li>
  <li>standard setting and guideline developing bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>Stakeholders can submit suggestions for new screening programmes through the annual call for topics.  Provision is also made for stakeholders to propose modifications (big changes) to screening programmes and suggestions for early updates of screening recommendations.</p>

<p>As part of the regular review update process stakeholders are invited to comment on the evidence review report during a three month consultation period.  The issues considered by regular update reviews are derived from previous review activity.  For example from gaps in the evidence identified by the reviews, from consultation responses and from submissions for early updates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Regular update reviews</h2>

<p>At the start of each regular update review the UK NSC evidence team will undertake a stakeholder review.  This is to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are included in the review.  Where the UK NSC database has a pre-existing list of stakeholders this will be cross checked against the list of stakeholders in comparable recommendations.  For example stakeholders in recommendations relating to one condition associated with newborn bloodspot screening might be expected to be interested in others.  In addition to the database cross check the UK NSC evidence team will undertake a web based search for new stakeholders.  Potential stakeholders identified in these ways will be invited to formally register with the UK NSC.  The letter of invitation also asks if any other potential stakeholders are known to organisations already engaged as stakeholders.</p>

<p>In most cases the UK NSC will prepare the scope of a review within its internal structures.  At this stage input from external stakeholders is sought as required on a review by review basis.  This is more likely to be the case when a new topic is being considered than when a regular update review is being undertaken.  In this latter case the scope of the review is derived from the key issues from the previous review, consultation responses and, where relevant, suggestions for early updates of screening recommendations. The scope of the reviews therefore takes into account stakeholder views expressed at previous consultation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Contributing to consultations on regular update reviews</h2>

<p>The UK NSC hosts a three month public consultation on each of its regular update reviews.  This provides stakeholders with an opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make an overall statement of their views on screening for the condition being reviewed and on the standard of the review</li>
  <li>draw attention to disagreements with the reviewâs recommendations or with particular aspects of a review</li>
  <li>highlight potential inconsistencies in the interpretation of the evidence which has been included in the review</li>
  <li>alert the Committee to questions or evidence which may have been omitted by a review and which may contribute to the recommendation</li>
  <li>suggest amendments to important errors in the wording of the review document</li>
</ul>

<p>Public consultation for these purposes helps ensure that the Committee is informed about the views of stakeholders as it develops its recommendations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Other consultations</h2>

<p>Where the UK NSC hosts consultations on work arising from systematic reviews, cost effectiveness assessments, disease models etc these will follow the same practical steps as for regular update reviews.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Practicalities</h2>

<p>Each registered stakeholder organisation has a named contact on the UK NSC database.  These are contacted directly by email when a consultation opens.</p>

<p>The named contact should ensure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one response is submitted from the organisation and comments should be collated into a single response</li>
  <li>the organisationâs response is submitted on the appropriate form and is sent to the dedicated consultation email address</li>
  <li>the organisationâs response is submitted by the deadline, responses cannot be accepted after the consultationâs closing date</li>
  <li>where one person submits a response on behalf of more than one organisation this should be made clear on each submission form.  Approval from an appropriate authority within each organisation should be sought prior to the submitting the responses</li>
  <li>that where the submission includes additional evidence to be considered for inclusion in the review, this should be within the dates of the literature search specified in the review document and published in a peer reviewed journal.  Experiences of individuals affected by the disease which is the subject of the review will be received by the Committee but will not be considered eligible as evidence within the review unless part of a published study.</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisations which are not registered at the beginning of a consultation can submit a response and should follow the same steps as a registered stakeholder.  The covering email should state whether they wish to register as a stakeholder.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Considering the comments submitted by stakeholders</h2>

<p>All comments will be considered in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in discussion with the reviewer to consider whether any changes to the review are required.  Any changes will be highlighted to the UK NSC</li>
  <li>as a submission to the UK NSC meeting at which the review is discussed, these will be considered by Committee members as part of the discussion on the review and its recommendation</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not possible to respond to each comment individually.  However stakeholders are informed of the outcome of the review following ministerial decision relating to the Committeeâs recommendation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Additional information</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Compliance with anti-discrimination law</h3>

<p>During the early stages of the evidence review process, the UK NSC aims to identify the widest range of relevant stakeholders and commentators who have an interest in the disease area being considered. This includes, but is not restricted to, national organisations representing relevant specific ethnic groups, people living with disabilities, people living with mental health impairments and those with learning disabilities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>Timing of involvement by stakeholders and commentators</h3>

<p>Any organisation meeting the above criteria wishing to become a stakeholder for a proposed recommendation can contact the UKNSC. This can be done at any point but comments submitted as part of a consultation cannot be accepted after the consultationâs closing date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Confidentiality and disclosure</h2>

<p>The UK NSC aims to publish all responses to review consultations in full. However the Committee realises that some stakeholders may wish to remain anonymous. The consultation feedback form enables stakeholders to specify that their name should not be made public.</p>

<p>The UK NSC operates in accordance with the access to information regimes (primarily the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA), the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004). As such it will always be necessary to remove patient identifiable information, even if permission to publish this has been specifically given.</p>

<p>If a stakeholder wants the information that it provides to be treated as confidential, please be aware that, under the FOIA, there is a statutory Code of Practice with which public authorities must comply.  This deals with obligations of confidence amongst other things. In view of this, it would be helpful if an explanation of why the information provided is regarded as confidential. If the Committee receives a request for disclosure of the information it will take full account of this explanation, but it cannot give an assurance that confidentiality can be maintained in all circumstances. An automatic confidentiality disclaimer generated by an IT system will not, of itself, be regarded as binding on the UK National Screening Committee.</p>

<p>The UK NSC will process any personal data in accordance with the DPA and, in most circumstances, this will mean that personal data will not be disclosed to third parties.</p>

<p>The UK NSC reserves the right not to publish or take into account any representations which are openly offensive or defamatory.</p>
