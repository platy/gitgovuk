<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the process used by the UK National Screening Committee (<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>) to review the evidence relating to the introduction, modification and cessation of national population screening programmes.</p>

<p>The process continues to be refined following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the pilot of the annual call for new topics</li>
  <li>further work on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s approach to development of rapid reviews</li>
  <li>completion of a statement on cost effectiveness assessments</li>
  <li>completion of a framework for consideration of ethical, social and legal issues relating to screening</li>
  <li>the use of in-service evaluations (previously known as pilots) to inform <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>UK National Screening Committee (<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> advises Ministers and the NHS in the 4 UK countries on all aspects of screening. In England there is a commitment in the NHS constitution to introduce screening programmes as recommended by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. More information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/uk-national-screening-committee-uk-nsc"><abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>, its membership and terms of reference</a> is available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Screening</h3>

<p>Screening is a public health service. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/nhs-population-screening-explained">purpose of screening</a> is to offer a test to members of a defined population who do not necessarily perceive that they are at risk of, or are already affected by, a disease or its complications. The test is to identify those individuals who are more likely to be helped than harmed by further tests or treatment to reduce the risk of disease or its complications.</p>

<p>Potential screening programmes that are within the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit are considered on a case by case basis. The following characteristics are a guide to what is in scope under that remit:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The target population to be screened should be large (sufficiently large to enable safe, clinically and cost effective screening)</li>
  <li>The cohort to be offered screening would regard themselves as not necessarily having symptoms of the disease or to be at risk of the disease (the business of the committee should be apparently healthy people)</li>
  <li>There should be an effective means of identifying and contacting the whole cohort to be offered screening</li>
  <li>The population should be proactively approached (by written invitation, verbal invitation at the time of the contact with the health service, encouraging attendance for screening) to ensure that those offered screening would be properly informed of the potential benefits and risks in order to help make an informed choice</li>
  <li>The primary purpose of screening should be to offer benefit to the person being screened. If there is no possibility of benefit to the person being offered screening then it should no longer be considered as a potential screening programme</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>
<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> criteria</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> assesses the evidence for screening against its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-review-criteria-national-screening-programmes">criteria for appraising the viability, effectiveness and appropriateness of a screening programme</a>. These cover important issues relating to the condition, the test, the treatment and the effectiveness of a screening programme. The criteria provide the framework for reviewing the evidence for screening for a broad range of conditions. The criteria were updated following a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-uk-national-screening-committee-2015">structure and process review of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> in 2015</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Current recommendations</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> has made <a class="govuk-link" href="https://legacyscreening.phe.org.uk/screening-recommendations.php" rel="external">recommendations on whether or not to introduce population screening programmes</a> for more than 100 conditions. The recommendations divide into 2 broad types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>conditions for which population screening programmes are not recommended</li>
  <li>conditions for which population screening programmes are recommended</li>
</ol>

<p>The evidence informing these recommendations is updated on a regular basis. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> has a publicly stated commitment to update each recommendation every 3 years. However, if significant evidence is published in between reviews stakeholders can submit a suggestion to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> for an early topic update. In addition, stakeholders can suggest changes to an existing screening programme or suggest a new topic for a screening programme. More detail on this is set out below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Quality improvement</h3>

<p>Developing the process and improving the quality of evidence reviews are important priorities for the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. The committee has been working to enhance the overall review process and to develop a consistent approach and format for its evidence reviews. This work has also been informed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recommendations from a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/science-technology/national_health_screening_Cm-8999.pdf" rel="external">House of Commons Science and Technology Committee Report On Health Screening</a> published in October 2014. This recommended that the evidential barrier to the introduction of a screening programme should remain high. It also made a number of recommendations relating to the reporting of evidence reviews. The government’s response to the report emphasised the need to clarify the review process as a whole, in particular the way in which screening topics are filtered, or ‘triaged’, to consider some in more depth through systematic reviews or other types of evidence product</li>
  <li>recommendations from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-uk-national-screening-committee-2015">structure and process review of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr></a> published in 2015. This review recommended the development of a consistent approach to evaluating the evidence for screening, including the way in which the evidence is assessed against the criteria</li>
</ul>

<p>Through its horizon scanning work, the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> identified the evolving international discussion on rapid reviews. This recognises the value of rapid reviews, the mainstay of evidence reviews directly commissioned by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>, for policy making and has highlighted the need to develop and improve how they are conducted and reported (see Appendix G).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Process development</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Formalising the process</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> reviews the evidence for screening in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a regular review when the current recommendation is not to offer population screening</li>
  <li>a regular review when the current recommendation is to offer population screening</li>
  <li>when new evidence is published which brings into question a current recommendation on screening</li>
  <li>when a proposal is made to modify, or make big changes to, a current screening programme</li>
  <li>when a proposal for a new topic which has not been previously reviewed by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> is submitted</li>
</ul>

<p>The process for reviewing the evidence for screening under each of these circumstances is set out in this document. Each section addresses the points at which a stepped (triage) approach will be used to evaluate proposals, the circumstances in which the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will develop evidence summaries using rapid review methodologies and where other evidence products may be considered more useful.</p>

<p>The process aims to ensure that each topic is addressed in a proportionate and timely manner and to provide reassurance to stakeholders that decisions are grounded in, and informed by, up to date evidence.</p>

<p>A process flowchart follows.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>
<abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summaries</h2>

<p><abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summaries are developed using rapid review methodologies. They provide an evaluation of the ‘volume and direction’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> of the literature on a single question or set of questions on a given screening topic. The purpose of the evidence summaries is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gauge whether there have been significant developments in the evidence base on important questions identified in previous reviews on the same topic</li>
  <li>establish whether a current recommendation can be reaffirmed</li>
  <li>establish whether a topic is likely to benefit from further assessment through the development of different types of evidence product, for example systematic reviews, cost effectiveness studies, disease modelling exercises, primary research and formal ethical considerations</li>
</ul>

<p>The value of rapid reviews in informing policy making has received increasing recognition. This approach enables the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> to publish up to date and robust reviews on a broad range of topics, to filter out those with poorer evidence bases and to identify gaps in the evidence which might provide the basis for research or more detailed evidence reviews. This helps ensure that the committee’s recommendations reflect the most up to date evidence on a wide range of topics.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/resources-and-guidance/rapid-evidence-assessment/how-to-do-a-rea" rel="external">UK Government Social Research Service</a> suggests that rapid evidence assessments provide a proportionate approach in a number of circumstances. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a policy decision is required in a short time period and policy makers/researchers want to make decisions based on the best available evidence within that time</li>
  <li>at policy development stage, when evidence of the likely effects of an intervention is required</li>
  <li>when a map of evidence in a topic area is required to determine whether there is any existing evidence and to direct future research needs</li>
  <li>as a starting point. Rapid reviews can form the basis of a more detailed systematic review should the volume and direction of the evidence suggest that this is necessary. In such cases, a rapid evidence assessment could be better described as an ‘interim evidence assessment’</li>
</ul>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> develops evidence summaries for all regular updates for which the current recommendation is not to introduce a population screening programme. In all other circumstances it is one approach among others where a topic proceeds beyond a triaging step. A triaging step has been introduced to ensure that an appropriate amount of resource can be directed to the topic in question.</p>

<p>See appendix F for the requirements relating to the conduct and reporting of a <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summary. A reporting checklist is available at appendix H.</p>

<p>Three examples of pilot <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summaries:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://legacy.screening.nhs.uk/galactosemia" rel="external">Galacotsaemia</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Developing a <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summary</h3>

<p>The evidence team, part of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> Secretariat, is responsible for managing the evidence review process to ensure <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> recommendations remain up to date. The team commissions evidence reviews on behalf of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. Experts in review methods and techniques are commissioned to undertake each review. Reviews are commissioned on a ‘contracting out’ basis. The general benefits of this approach are discussed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/resources-and-guidance/rapid-evidence-assessment" rel="external">UK Government Social Research Service</a> website.</p>

<p>Evidence summary projects are undertaken in 3 stages; commissioning, document development and sign off. To ensure that all relevant stakeholders have an opportunity to input to the review, a stakeholder review is undertaken during the commissioning stage. This involves a web-based search, and a cross-check of currently registered stakeholders, to identify any potential new stakeholders in the review in question. See appendix C for further information on stakeholder involvement.</p>

<p>An agreement with the reviewing organisation is developed following discussion about the conduct of the review project. Discussion is based on an initial briefing note drawn up by the evidence team. This outlines the purpose of the review and the proposed key questions. A formal letter of agreement with the reviewing organisation includes, but is not confined to, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review questions and strategy, refined where necessary by the reviewer and agreed in discussion with the evidence team</li>
  <li>composition of the review team within the reviewing organisation and the arrangements for quality control, for example selection and appraisal of papers, peer review</li>
  <li>plan for ‘in review’ meetings between evidence team and reviewers, commissioner feedback and risk reporting</li>
  <li>plan for the literature search. This is sometimes provided by the evidence team and sometimes by the reviewer. A note on literature searching for this kind of project is attached at appendix G. In the case of regular updates, search strategies should look for papers published after the previous search ended. Where a rapid review is undertaken following a triage assessment the search strategy timescales will vary and will be agreed on a case by case basis, this will mainly be the case in circumstances where no previous review has been produced</li>
  <li>arrangements for considering comments and feedback received during the consultation</li>
  <li>arrangements for publication and communication of the completed review during and after the review project completion</li>
</ul>

<p>The flowchart below sets out the main steps in the development of a <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Process summaries</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Conditions for which the current recommendation is not to offer population screening</h3>

<p>The evidence for each condition where the current recommendation is not to offer screening is reviewed every 3 years. Evidence summaries for these updates are commissioned and produced using rapid review methods outlined above and in appendix F.</p>

<p>For each condition a recommendation statement highlights important areas of uncertainty. For example, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://legacy.screening.nhs.uk/prostatecancer" rel="external">prostate cancer</a> is a major public health problem and there is evidence of acceptability of the test, thereby meeting some of the criteria. But major problems relate to the tests, a poor understanding of how the disease develops (natural history) and treatment effects. Therefore the recommendation is that screening should not be offered because the potential harms outweigh the potential benefits. Regular updates use such areas of uncertainty as a starting point and aim to search for, analyse and consult on new evidence relating to those questions. Additional sources of potential review questions are the responses to public consultations on the previous review and any submissions for early updates which may have been received.</p>

<h4>Consultation and sign-off</h4>

<p>Following a pre-consultation exercise a 3 month public consultation is hosted on the GOV.UK website. Registered stakeholders are contacted directly. See appendix C for further information on stakeholder input to a consultation and how to become a stakeholder.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> receives all consultation responses in full at the meeting at which the review is discussed. Before the meeting the committee receives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the evidence review showing the volume, direction and summary of the published literature</li>
  <li>a paper bringing together all consultation responses in full</li>
  <li>a cover sheet prepared by the evidence team which summarises the review project and makes a recommendation (a template summary form can be found at appendix B)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the basis of these papers the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> makes a recommendation.</p>

<p>At the meeting the committee will receive a presentation on the evidence review showing the volume, direction and summary of the published literature.</p>

<p>At the chair’s discretion the reviewer may be asked to attend to present the findings and respond to questions.</p>

<p>The chair will discuss the work and presentations with the committee members and ask questions of the secretariat if necessary. The members will be asked to move to a recommendation. The aim of the discussion at the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting is to make a consensus decision. Where a consensus is not achievable a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443951/20150603_-_Code_of_Practice.pdf">voting system</a> is used.</p>

<p>The committee is asked to decide whether the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current recommendation should be retained or whether further work is necessary before making a recommendation</li>
  <li>topic should be archived or revisited as part of the regular review cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Where further evaluation is considered appropriate, the options may include primary research, systematic review, cost effectiveness assessment, modelling, further rapid reviews or an in-service evaluation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Conditions for which population screening programmes are recommended</h3>

<p>Regular update reviews for this category of recommendation focus on whether there is new evidence suggesting that a national screening programme (NSP) should be stopped. Each recommendation passes through a standard assessment and triage stage.</p>

<h4>Triage assessment</h4>

<p>This consists of an externally produced report on a literature search undertaken to identify whether any papers have been published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>addressing screening programme cessation</li>
  <li>reporting harms from screening</li>
  <li>reporting balance of harms and benefits from screening</li>
</ul>

<p>If no papers are identified on the above a recommendation to continue the programme should be made. Stakeholders will be contacted for comments on the recommendation and a 3 month consultation will be hosted on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> website.</p>

<p>If papers on programme cessation or harms from screening are identified, the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will consider whether further work is necessary before making a final recommendation on the topic. If this is considered necessary the committee will recommend that the issue is considered in more depth.</p>

<h4>Consultation and sign off</h4>

<p>Following a pre-consultation exercise a 3-month public consultation is hosted on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-nsc-consultations"><abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> website</a>. Registered stakeholders are contacted directly. See appendix C for further information on stakeholder input to a consultation.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> receives all consultation responses at the meeting at which the review is discussed. Before the meeting the committee receives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the evidence review showing the volume, direction and summary of the published literature</li>
  <li>a paper bringing together all consultation responses in full</li>
  <li>a cover sheet prepared by the evidence team which summarises the review project and makes a recommendation (a template summary form can be found at appendix B)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the basis of these papers the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> makes a recommendation.</p>

<p>At the meeting the committee will receive a presentation on the evidence review showing the volume, direction and summary of the published literature.</p>

<p>At the chair’s discretion the reviewer may be asked to attend to present the findings and respond to questions.</p>

<p>The chair will discuss the work and presentations with the committee members and ask questions of the secretariat if necessary. The members will be asked to move to a recommendation. The aim of the discussion at the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting is to make a consensus decision. Where a consensus is not achievable a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-uk-national-screening-committee-2015">voting system</a> is used.</p>

<p>Where further evaluation is considered appropriate, the options may include primary research, systematic review, cost effectiveness assessment, modelling, further rapid reviews or an in-service evaluation. These options are described in more detail later on.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>When new evidence is published which brings into question a current recommendation on screening (early update)</h3>

<p>Individuals and organisations may alert the committee to new evidence which is published at any time which may alter a screening recommendation. The purpose is to identify published research which may prompt an early update of a review. Examples of the type of evidence may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>published large scale randomised controlled trials which demonstrate benefit or harms from screening</li>
  <li>published studies comparing early treatment in a relevant population with later treatment in clinically detected populations</li>
  <li>published studies evaluating test performance in large populations relevant to the condition in question</li>
  <li>published epidemiological studies which improve understanding of the UK prevalence of the condition or the natural history of the condition</li>
  <li>published cost effectiveness studies directly relating to a UK setting</li>
</ul>

<p>Decision making on the justification for undertaking an early update involves consideration of a review’s conclusions on a range of <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> criteria. For example, additional evidence which changes a review’s conclusion on one criterion may not alter the overall conclusion on whether screening should or should not be recommended.</p>

<p>Suggestions for early updates can be submitted at any point and should provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the condition, review document and criterion to which the suggestion relates</li>
  <li>citation details of the submitted paper or papers</li>
  <li>discussion of the way in which the paper, or papers, affects a) the criterion or criteria in question and b) the review’s overall recommendation on whether screening should or should not be recommended</li>
</ul>

<p>A submission form can be found at appendix D. Suggestions are considered in 2 steps.</p>

<h4>Step one</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team produces a brief paper assessing whether a submission relates directly to the condition and the review in question and an initial estimate of the impact of the submitted paper or papers on the conclusion of the review. The paper recommends whether the submission should be taken further. This is considered by the chair of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. On the basis of this a decision is made on whether the submission should go forward to step 2.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - triage</h4>

<p>Step 2 involves an external assessment of the submission and a decision by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> on whether an early update is required. Where possible the external assessment is undertaken by the original reviewer. A brief document is produced consisting of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a critical appraisal of the paper or papers</li>
  <li>a commentary on the impact on the criterion, or criteria, provided in the submission and on the impact on the overall conclusions of the review</li>
</ul>

<p>Only papers published after the date of the review’s literature search will be considered.</p>

<p>If the submitted paper does not alter the overall recommendation on whether screening should or should not be recommended, an early update will not be recommended. The submitted papers will be considered for inclusion in the next regular update.</p>

<p>The results of the assessment are considered at the first possible <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting. The person or organisation submitting the suggestion for an early update will be contacted about the committee’s recommendation no more than 6 weeks following the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting.</p>

<p>If the submitted paper or papers are judged to alter the overall recommendation on whether screening should or should not be recommended the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will recommend further work to consider the issue in more depth. Where this is considered appropriate, the options may include primary research, systematic review, cost effectiveness assessment, modelling, a rapid review or an in-service evaluation.</p>

<p>Any outputs from this work will be subject to a 3 month public consultation hosted on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> website.</p>

<p>Registered stakeholders are contacted directly regarding the recommendation to undertake an early update of the recommendation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span>When a proposal is made to modify, or make big changes to a current screening programme</h3>

<p>NSPs are not static. The science of screening is always developing and the number of people with the conditions changes over time. For example, a perceived need for change may originate in research undertaken outside the screening programme. It may also arise from a requirement for improvement and innovation identified within the screening programme itself. As such, proposals to modify screening programmes could be submitted from a range of stakeholders or organisations.</p>

<p>Modifications, or big changes, to NSPs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes to the age at initiation of screening</li>
  <li>alterations to cut offs used to establish risk</li>
  <li>extension or shortening of screening intervals</li>
  <li>introduction of an alternative screening test to replace the current test</li>
  <li>introduction of an additional test in the pathway</li>
  <li>evidence of altered cost effectiveness or cost</li>
  <li>a shift in understanding of the natural history of screened diseases such that other elements of the pathway needed to be altered</li>
  <li>evidence of a shift in acceptability</li>
  <li>evidence that primary prevention or treatment are so effective that screening no longer had an important role to play in preventing or reducing the risk of the condition</li>
  <li>evidence that despite good research evidence the programme is not able to deliver benefits in practice</li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence review process needs to be responsive to such proposals from stakeholders. Suggestions for modifications to screening programmes can be submitted at any point.</p>

<p>Where proposals for modifications originate within screening programme structures, early discussion with the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team is encouraged. This contributes to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> horizon scanning function.</p>

<p>The following information is required for proposals for modifications to screening programmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a statement on the element of the programme to be modified</li>
  <li>published evidence addressing and supporting the outcomes expected from the modification in a relevant population. Outcomes of interest may include increased test sensitivity or specificity, increased uptake of screening, increase or reduction in the number of screening rounds</li>
  <li>published evidence addressing the wider pathway impact arising from the modification. These may include the identification of new types of abnormality as a consequence of a new test, identification of incidental findings not previously detected or revised cost effectiveness estimates</li>
  <li>a flowchart to illustrate the flow of people through the various stages of the screening pathway including the expected outcomes</li>
  <li>no more than 10 references addressing and supporting the modification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The submission form can be found at appendix D. Submissions will be considered in 2 steps.</p>

<h4>Step 1 – relevance to <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> remit</h4>

<p>Step one is an internal process in which the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team produces a brief paper assessing whether a submission is within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> and whether it constitutes a ‘big change’ to the programme. The paper makes a recommendation on whether the submission should be taken further. This is considered by the Director of Programmes and the Chair of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. On the basis of this, a decision is made on whether the submission should go forward to step 2.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - triage</h4>

<p>Step 2 involves an external assessment of the submission and a decision by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> on whether the topic would benefit from further evaluation.</p>

<p>The external assessment consists of a briefing note summarising the extent to which the submitted references address and support the outcomes of interest stated in the submission. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will generally consider submissions informed by higher levels of evidence to be stronger. Higher levels of evidence include systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and test accuracy studies with consecutively enrolled or randomly selected samples from a relevant population. There are circumstances and conditions where RCT evidence is unlikely to be possible, so the committee considers other types of evidence.</p>

<p>The external assessment may identify the need to explore the proposal in more detail. Where this is considered appropriate, the options may include primary research, systematic review, cost effectiveness assessment, modelling, an in-service evaluation (pilot) or a rapid review.</p>

<p>The results of the assessment are considered at the first possible <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting. The person or organisation submitting the suggestion for an early update will be contacted about the committee’s recommendation no more than 6 weeks following the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> recommends further work to evaluate the proposal registered stakeholders will be contacted directly.</p>

<p>Any outputs from this work will be subject to a 3-month public consultation hosted on the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> website.</p>

<p>A process flowchart follows.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span>When a proposal for a new topic which has not been previously reviewed by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> is submitted</h3>

<h4>Annual call for new screening topics</h4>

<p>The annual call for new screening topics has been introduced to ensure that stakeholders have a regular opportunity to suggest new topics which might be evaluated against the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> criteria.</p>

<p>Any individual or organisation can submit a topic for consideration. To ensure the process is fair it is important that all submissions adhere to the standard requirements in terms of length and format.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will advertise the call for topics by contacting all registered <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> stakeholders directly and by using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nationalscreening.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> blog</a>.</p>

<p>The annual call for new topics will be advertised in the first week of September, with 3 months to make a submission.</p>

<p>Each submission must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>published evidence on the number of people with the disease or condition in the UK at any one time (prevalence), what range of effects the disease or condition has on sufferers (for example, the number of deaths or disabilities) and how a screening programme might alter this (for example, reduced deaths, fewer people with the illness, fewer people with disabilities)</li>
  <li>evidence, from published studies, that a test can find the condition or risk of disease in people in whom the screening programme would be offered (for example, all newborn babies) and has a cut off (a test result that separates those with and without the disease or risk of disease)</li>
  <li>evidence from published studies in the people in whom the screening programme would be offered that early treatment or care is more effective than later (for example in all newborn babies)</li>
  <li>a statement on whether there has been a randomised controlled trial showing benefit from screening</li>
  <li>a flowchart to illustrate the number of people passing through each stage of the screening pathway. This should include the number i) accepting/declining screening, ii) testing positive/negative/uncertain, iii) receiving treatment and iv) helped/or unaffected by the programme (an example can be found out appendix E)</li>
  <li>no more than 10 references to support the main points of the submission</li>
</ul>

<p>The submission form can be found at appendix D. Submissions will be considered in 2 steps.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team is not able to assist with the development of the details of the submission and will only enter into correspondence regarding the submission and evaluation process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span>Step 1 – relevance to <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> remit</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team will assess whether submissions are within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. The assessment is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether the topic submission is screening as opposed to a different type of intervention. For example, offering a test for syphilis to people presenting in GUM clinics is often referred to as screening but would not be within the remit of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> as outlined earlier in this document</li>
  <li>whether the population to be offered screening would be large enough to make screening clinically or cost effective. Screening programme populations are large. The pregnant and newborn populations are currently the smallest populations for which nationally managed screening programmes have been established. There are approximately 750,000 live births each year in the UK</li>
  <li>whether the population is asymptomatic, low risk or unaware of the disease risk which is the subject of the topic</li>
  <li>whether the test aims to assess risk rather than diagnose disease</li>
  <li>how the eligible population will be identified and offered screening</li>
</ul>

<p>A brief paper addressing these points, prepared by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team, will be considered by the chair of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>. On the basis of this a decision is made on whether the submission should go forward to step 2.</p>

<p>Where there is uncertainty about the topic’s relevance to the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr>’s remit advice is sought from the wider <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> membership.</p>

<p>The person or organisation submitting the topic is contacted about the outcome of this step within 10 weeks of the annual call closing.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - triage</h4>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team will commission an external assessment of the submission. This informs a decision by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> on whether the topic would benefit from further evaluation in an evidence summary.</p>

<p>The external assessment will consist of a briefing note summarising the extent to which the submitted references address and support the outcomes stated in the submission. The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> will generally consider submissions informed by higher levels of evidence to be stronger. Higher levels of evidence include systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and test accuracy studies with consecutively enrolled or randomly selected samples from a relevant population. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.casp-uk.net/#!casp-tools-checklists/c18f8" rel="external">CASP website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The triage assessment is not intended to provide a definitive statement on the case for screening. It is intended to distinguish topics which are likely to benefit from further investigation from those which would not.</p>

<p>An evidence map, outlining the volume and type of evidence which is available on a given topic, may also be commissioned by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence team to gauge the literature likely to be encountered if a rapid review on the topic is recommended. The need for this is determined on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>The results of the external assessment and, where undertaken, the evidence map are considered at the first possible <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting. The person or organisation submitting the topic will be contacted about the committee’s decision on whether an evidence summary will be undertaken within 10 weeks of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> meeting.</p>

<p>See the section of this document addressing the development of an evidence summary. Appendix F details the requirements relating to the conduct and reporting of a <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summary. A reporting checklist is available at appendix H.</p>

<figcaption><p>New topic submitted through the annual call</p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Options for considering a topic in greater depth</h2>

<p>The main function of the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence review process is to provide robust advice on screening to government ministers and the NHS in the 4 UK countries. In some cases the review process will identify issues which might be addressed through the development of other evidence products and processes.</p>

<p>Primary research, systematic reviews, cost effectiveness assessments, modelling projects, in-service evaluations, formal ethical considerations and further rapid reviews have been highlighted as potential options in this document.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Primary research</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> is not a research commissioning or funding body. Primary research on screening topics should be undertaken to standards which are current in the UK and on screening populations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Systematic reviews</h3>

<p>Systematic reviews commissioned by the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> should use accepted methodologies such as, but not restricted to, those published by Cochrane, York CRD, NICE. The approach should be discussed with the commissioning manager and stated clearly in the review methodology.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Cost effectiveness assessments and disease modelling projects</h3>

<p>A statement on the assessment of the cost effectiveness of screening is currently being developed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Rapid reviews / evidence summaries</h3>

<p>See appendix G for a statement of requirements for a <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> evidence summary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>In-service evaluations</h2>

<p>In-service evaluations are used to test proposed changes to existing and proposed new programmes. They involve the new or updated programme being implemented by NHS providers over a period of time, during which data is collected to help answer specific questions on its operational impact and effectiveness. The evaluations are overseen by the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) screening team. They are designed with academic support to ensure the conduct of the study and the findings are sufficiently robust to support the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> in making formal recommendations to ministers.</p>

<p>The results of in-service evaluations are used to support the <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> in making recommendations and to inform wider policy decisions.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> requests an in-service evaluation when it considers a proposal received and reviewed as above has merit but its practical implementation in routine NHS care would benefit from evaluation and/or data from large scale programmes is needed. For example, an in-service evaluation is being undertaken on the use of self-sampling as a routine cervical screening delivery mechanism.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="UK National Screening Committee">UK NSC</abbr> submits in-service evaluation requests to ministers for approval.</p>
