<p>The value of rapid reviews in informing policy making has received increasing interest and recognition recently. The UK NSC commissions evidence summaries using rapid review methodologies.</p>

<p>Evidence summaries are not systematic reviews produced quickly <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Their purpose is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gauge whether there have been significant developments in the evidence base on key questions identified in previous reviews on the same topic</li>
  <li>establish whether a current recommendation can be reaffirmed</li>
  <li>establish whether a topic is likely to benefit from further assessment through the development of different types of evidence product, for example systematic reviews, cost effectiveness studies, disease modelling exercises, primary research</li>
</ul>

<p>The following provides background information on the discussion about rapid reviews and the requirements for UK NSC evidence summaries.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Varied practice</h2>

<p>Variation in rapid reviewing practice means that the distinction between rapid and systematic reviews has yet to be clearly stated.  A number of areas of variation have been identified and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number and type of questions included in the review</li>
  <li>comprehensiveness of the literature search in terms of time frame, geographical area and / or number of databases searched</li>
  <li>arrangements for literature selection, extraction and appraisal</li>
  <li>inclusion of evidence synthesis and recommendations</li>
  <li>arrangements for internal and external quality control of the review</li>
</ul>

<p>Key differences between rapid and systematic reviews have been identified. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rapid reviews are produced more quickly</li>
  <li>rapid reviews require continuous engagement with the commissioning organisation throughout the document development process</li>
  <li>rapid reviews generally focusing on a descriptive approach to synthesis in contrast to, for example, meta-analysis</li>
  <li>inferences drawn from the review, which tend to be more cautious and / or provisional in rapid reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>The inclusion of a statement of methods used is an essential element in a publication of rapid reviews to improve the transparency of rapid reviews <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Consideration of the above issues is needed to encourage consistency between UK NSC reviews.  While broad consistency between UK NSC rapid reviews is the goal, variation is likely to remain because of the range of diseases covered and the breadth of issues within the criteria.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>A question led approach</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/gsr/resources-and-guidance/rapid-evidence-assessment" rel="external">UK Government Social Research Service</a> recommends a question led approach to rapid reviews. This:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the driver for all rapid evidence assessment processes</li>
  <li>is a statement that can be investigated rather than a subject area of interest</li>
  <li>should be clear and answerable</li>
  <li>should need an answer and be worth answering</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK NSC criteria provide key headings, the details relating to the condition under review should be specified prior to commencing the review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Executive summary and plain English summary</h2>

<p>UK NSC evidence summaries will be the subject of a public consultation process involving a varied readership.</p>

<p>An executive summary and a user, or consumer, summary should be included at the start of the review covering the main points of the document using language and terminology suitable to non- specialist audiences.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Statement of approach</h2>

<p>In keeping with rapid review approaches, UK NSC evidence summaries do not rely on a particular methodology.  In the interests of transparency, a statement of the approach taken should be presented.  This should draw attention to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>aims and objectives of the review</li>
  <li>source of the questions and process of refinement</li>
  <li>databases searched, key search terms, date range of the search</li>
  <li>arrangements for selection and appraisal (such as inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of reviewers, cross checking of sample at title, abstract and full text level)</li>
  <li>approach where no studies of optimum type identified or when large number of studies are identified</li>
  <li>critical appraisal checklist if used</li>
  <li>approach to assessment of quality and procedural limitations, if any, in relation to chosen system</li>
  <li>approach to synthesis of the critically appraised evidence</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Rapid review format and presentation</h2>

<p>A standardised format and presentational style will contribute to the consistency of UK NSC evidence summaries.</p>

<p>For all questions considered in the review the following should be included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a background discussion explaining the rationale for the question</li>
  <li>the strategy for addressing the question.  For example the prioritised study design, outcomes and, where relevant, comparators should be described along with the approach taken in situations where no such studies were identified</li>
  <li>tabulated appraisals of individual studies presented in the appendix of the review.  These should be cross referenced to the question to which they refer, should describe the main points of the paper and should appraise the quality of the paper</li>
  <li>a description of the volume of the literature at each stage of the sifting process and the number of reviewers engaged in the process.  Paired reviewing of the literature may not be possible due to time and resource constraints and the arrangements for study selection and analysis should be described</li>
  <li>where possible and relevant key findings from the papers should be combined in a tabulated form in the main body of the review.  This should be accompanied by a discussion and analysis of key issues in the body of evidence as a whole</li>
  <li>a final summary of the literature should make an overall statement of the quality of evidence as it relates to the question and whether it suggests the criteria to which it refers is met, not met or partially met</li>
  <li>the literature search strategy should be included as an appendix to the review</li>
</ul>

<p>Three examples of pilot UK NSC evidence summaries are:</p>

  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://legacy.screening.nhs.uk/galactosemia" rel="external">Galacotsaemia</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Critical appraisal of individual studies</h2>

<p>Assessment of the quality of the literature should refer to recognised checklists and methods.  A number of checklists and methods are available to support critical appraisal of, for example, diagnostic studies, cohort studies and economic evaluations.  Examples are provided at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.casp-uk.net/#!casp-tools-checklists/c18f8" rel="external">Critical Appraisal Skills Programme</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/checklists.html" rel="external">Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.cebm.net/critical-appraisal/" rel="external">Centre for Evidence Based Medicine</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Checklists provide a structured means of assessing the quality, or risk of bias, of individual studies and typically focus on issues relating to the study design, conduct, reporting, and the results of the study.  The internal validity and the generalisability, or applicability, of the study to settings beyond that of the study environment are also key features of critical appraisal checklists.</p>

<p>Recent discussion has emphasised two concerns about appraisal of individual studies, that there is a need for transparency in categorising study quality and a need to avoid being overly formulaic <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) note that checklists do not replace judgement but should be used as an âaide memoirâ to structure appraisal of papers ,  If a checklist is used for the purposes of appraisal this should be stated in the reviewâs statement of approach.</p>

<p>The difficulties associated with prescribing a particular approach to appraisal has been noted <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>.  The aim of appraisal is to provide a sense of the rigour of individual studies which can inform the synthesis of the body of evidence.  General advice on the assessment of study quality within systematic reviews has been developed and might provide a reference point for UK NSC evidence reviews.</p>

<p>In practical terms discussion of the following is required in a UK NSC evidence summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quality issues and an overall assessment of each included study, these should be positioned in the comments section of the study tables in the appendix.  Sources of guidance vary on the use of the term âqualityâ and âquality assessmentâ and there is overlap with the term ârisk of bias assessmentâ.  There is also variation in the components included in such assessments.  These have included (a) conduct of the study/internal validity, (b) external validity, generalisability or applicability, (c) completeness of reporting, (d) selective outcome reporting, (e) choice of outcome measures, (f) study design, (g) compliance with study protocol and (h) conflicts of interest.  Reviewers should clearly state the issues being considered within the evidence summary.</li>
  <li>issues relating to the precision of individual study outcomes should be discussed at this point as meta analysis is not undertaken within the context of a UK NSC evidence summary.  This is because the (a) documents are not intended to be systematic reviews and the methods employed may not be sufficient to support a reliable meta analysis, (b) in many cases evidence reviews are updates on literature addressing key questions identified in previous decision making rounds and the included papers may not provide a sufficient basis for a meta analysis, (c) one of the functions of UK NSC evidence reviews is to establish whether topics require further investigation through other approaches including systematic review.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Synthesis</h2>

<p>A strength of evidence assessment for the body of evidence as a whole is not required and may not be appropriate in the context of a UK NSC evidence summary.  The aim of the synthesis is to provide a balanced discussion of the body of evidence which avoids over reliance on one study or set of studies.  Four components should be considered and these should inform the reviewerâs judgement on whether the criteria is met, not met or partially met.  These are well established and consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>quantity (this could include discussion the number of studies, number of subjects in relation to particular outcomes, range of effects, sample size or power)</li>
  <li>quality (systems to assess and assign a level to the body of evidence as a whole are available <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>. However use of rating methodologies may not be possible within the constraints of an evidence summary where a systematic review has not been undertaken.  Nevertheless reviewers should provide a summary of the quality of the body of evidence and highlight relevant themes across the body of evidence.)</li>
  <li>applicability (this addresses the extent to which the evidence directly addresses a question, for example, in terms of population, intervention, comparator or outcome)</li>
  <li>consistency (this addresses the extent to which similar findings are reported using similar or different study designs, statistical approaches etc for a given question or outcome)</li>
</ul>

<p>Approaches to synthesis may vary according to the type of results being organised, described and explored.  It is unlikely that meta analysis will be performed in the context of a rapid review.  Guidance on synthesis techniques and options in the absence of meta analysis has been developed and may provide a reference point for reviewers involved in the development of a UK NSC evidence summary <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. See an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://legacy.screening.nhs.uk/policydb_download.php?doc=470" rel="external">example of the use of narrative synthesis techniques in a rapid review context</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Quality of the evidence - the test</h2>

<p>To synthesise studies relating to the test reviewers should follow the overall format suggested above.  The main body of the review should be a summary of the body of evidence as a whole.  This might be achieved in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the reported test values in the included studies should be tabulated.  The included data may vary by review but the core aim should be to present basic measures of test performance, for example the sensitivity and specificity or the likelihood ratios, and a measure of performance which takes account of background prevalence, for example the positive and negative predictive values or the post test probabilities</li>
  <li>a summary of the quality of the included papers requires different emphases to the more generic factors highlighted above.  For example the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/quadas/migrated/documents/background-doc.pdf" rel="external">QUADAS-2 framework</a> was developed for this purpose</li>
</ul>

<p>QUADAS-2 provides a framework for the assessment of the quality of primary test accuracy studies.  The method identifies four âdomainsâ which aim to focus reviewersâ attention on sources of bias and to help make a judgement on the applicability of the studies to the review questions.  âSignalling questionsâ on key elements within each domain are provided to support judgement on risk of bias and applicability.  The domains are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>patient selection</li>
  <li>index test</li>
  <li>reference standard</li>
  <li>flow and timing of index test and reference standard</li>
</ul>

<p>These are key categories in determining the direction of the evidence in the context of test accuracy studies and can be used to structure discussion of the body of evidence brought together in the review.  Signalling questions within each domain can be adapted to each review where necessary. <br>
As with other approaches to the assessment of quality, the QUADAS-2 approach is designed for use in systematic reviews.  It is recognised that all of the elements of the method may not be possible in an evidence summary.  For example tailoring of the issues within each domain should be undertaken as part of the discussion on the review scope and approach.  However paired piloting of this may not be feasible.  Similarly a tabular presentation of the results of the QUADAS-2 assessment may not be possible.  These limitations should be acknowledged in the review methodology and caution should be applied in the summary statement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Summary Statement</h2>

<p>On the basis of the synthesis a judgement should be made on whether the criteria is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>met (for example, this should be applied in circumstances in which there is a sufficient volume of evidence of sufficient quality to judge an outcome or effect which is unlikely to be changed by further research or systematic review)</li>
  <li>not met (for example, this should be applied in circumstances where there is insufficient evidence to clearly judge an outcome or effect or where there is sufficient evidence of poor performance)</li>
  <li>uncertain (for example, this should be applied in circumstances in which the constraints of an evidence summary prevent a reliable answer to the question.  An example of this may be when the need for a systematic review and meta analysis is identified by the rapid review)</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases the rationale for the summary statement should be explained in terms of the interaction of the components which are brought together in the synthesis.</p>

<p>Reviewers should use the reporting checklist to ensure the requirements of the review have been addressed.</p>
