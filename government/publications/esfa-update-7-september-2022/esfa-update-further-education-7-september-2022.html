<span class="number">1. </span>Action: review your R12 in-year qualification achievement rate</h2>

<p>In-year qualification achievement rate (QARs) for 2021 to 2022 have been updated to reflect R12 data and are now available via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">View Your Education Data</a> portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dashboards provide indicative QARs for apprenticeships, education and training and traineeships and have been updated to reflect R12 data.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity to identify and resolve potential data issues prior to the ILR R14 hard close on Thursday 20 October 2022. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-2021-to-2022">The QAR 2021 to 2022 guidance</a> provides support based on common data issues that can arise.</p>

<p>Alongside the dashboard, we also provide data extracts to show achievement rates, pass rates and retention rates to match those in the QAR dashboard.</p>

<p>The data extracts identify the learners expected to complete, or that have completed, over the multiple funding years, used to produce the QAR dataset for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: FE workforce data collection opens on 12 September 2022</h2>

<p>The FE workforce data collection will open for returns on Monday 12 September covering the 2021 to 2022 academic year. This year’s collection is mandatory for all eligible providers.</p>

<p>This collection will help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a better understanding of the implications of government policy reforms and their impact on the composition of staff and their specialisms, for example the impact of the introduction of T Levels</li>
  <li>provide a better understanding of the sector and allow us to view changes over time, which will help us to tailor more effective support for FE Providers</li>
  <li>reveal skills gaps in the sector and model skills gaps and their impact</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be publishing outcomes in Spring 2023, for the benefit of providers and key stakeholders, such as Ofsted and sector representatives.</p>

<p>We have released <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-workforce-data-collection">guidance documents for the collections to support staff who are completing the collections</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: new validation rule on ILR entries for planned off-the-job training hours</h2>

<p>You are required to record the planned off-the-job training hours for apprentices in their individual learner record (ILR). A small number of apprentices whose off-the-job planned training hours are reported below the absolute minimum to be an eligible apprenticeship of 278 hours. These incorrect entries have previously been flagged to providers through the accountability framework, PDSATs and the FRM37 report.</p>

<p>To help you spot and correct these even earlier in the process, and before they become an accountability issue, we are putting a new validation rule in place.</p>

<p>This means that ILR entries with less than 278 planned off-the-job training hours will be rejected. They will not appear on the ILR and funding will not be given for an invalid entry. This will come into force no later than R04.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that planned off-the-job training hours must be calculated as outlined in the funding rules and that for many apprentices the minimum required will exceed 278 hours. The validation rule does not guarantee compliance but will remove any records that fail to meet the absolute minimum required to be an eligible apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Please use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications-topic&amp;utm_source=ab1ecf55-b562-4e48-8c6a-87b38f631bd3&amp;utm_content=immediately">funding rules</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training">guidance on off-the-job training</a> to identify the correct minimum requirement for each learner and use the Funding Rule Monitoring Report 37 as well as your own systems to spot any outliers.</p>

<p>There is still time to apply for the 2022 to 2023 cohorts of the ‘New to mentoring’ and ‘Advanced mentoring’ programmes, which are designed to develop high-quality mentoring skills in the FE sector and are delivered by the Education and Training Foundation (ETF).</p>

<p>These DfE-funded programmes will run between October 2022 and February 2023 and will be supported with a grant to each participants’ organisations of up to £4,000. Applications will close on Friday 30 September 2022 and so we encourage you to register via the ETF’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/professional-development/mentoring/professional-development-programmes/" rel="external">mentoring homepage</a> to avoid missing out on this opportunity.</p>

<p>Not a mentor but looking to get the most out of your mentoring relationship? Or do you manage a FE mentoring scheme? Why not sign up to one of ETF’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/professional-development/mentoring/cpd-webinars/" rel="external">free webinars</a> , or undertake a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/professional-development/mentoring/short-courses-for-mentees-mentoring-coordinators-and-leaders/" rel="external">short mentoring course</a> which are designed to help FE mentors, mentees, mentoring coordinators and leaders, realise their potential.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: national professional qualifications: targeted support funding for settings with 1 to 600 pupils</h2>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/targeted-support-funding-for-national-professional-qualifications">conditions of grant for the national professional qualifications (NPQs)</a> funding to support teachers and leaders to participate in NPQs.</p>

<p>We know that staff who work in smaller settings can face more barriers to participating in professional development. To support these staff to access NPQs, from autumn 2022 state-funded schools and 16 to 19 organisations with between 1 and 600 pupils will receive £200 for every teacher or leader they employ who takes an NPQ.</p>

<p>These grant payments are in addition to government funded NPQ scholarships.</p>

<p>Teachers and leaders who work in state-funded settings in England are eligible for NPQ scholarships, which cover the training cost of the qualifications.</p>

<p>You can read further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms">funding available to teachers and leaders taking NPQs</a>.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span>Information: DfE announces contracts for £18 million investment in the Supported Internships programme</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has announced the Internships Work consortium and the British Association of Supported Employment (BASE) as the chosen delivery partners for an £18 million investment in the Supported Internships programme.</p>

<p>The new Internships Work programme will deliver on a commitment set out in the SEND and AP green paper, offering more young people who have additional needs (an Education, Health and Care Plan) the skills to secure and sustain paid employment.</p>

<p>The Internships Work programme includes the National Development Team for Inclusion (NDTi), BASE, and DFN Project SEARCH. It will work closely with local authorities to double the number of supported internships by 2025, engaging with employers and young people to level up the quality of Supported Internships across the programme.</p>

<p>In addition to their involvement in Internships Work, BASE will offer personalised support to young people in acquiring skills and independence by training over 700 new job coaches by 2025.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ndti.org.uk/projects/internships-work" rel="external">Internships Work</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.base-uk.org/" rel="external">BASE</a> by visiting their websites.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Information: post-16 capacity fund is now open&nbsp;for bids</h2>

<p>The next round of the post-16 capacity fund launched on 7 September 2022, inviting bids from eligible post-16 providers for capital funding to add extra capacity where there is a pressing need for places for 16 to 19-year-olds in their local area.</p>

<p>The post-16 capacity fund will deliver the government’s 2021 spending review commitment to invest £155 million in capital over 3 years (2022 to 2025). In this bidding round, providers can bid for a share of £140m to deliver projects creating additional capacity, ensuring there are enough places in their local area to manage the projected demographic increase in 16-19 learners.</p>

<p>48 providers have already benefited from the £83 million spending commitment in 2021 to 2022 and the £15m funding made available in 2022 to 2023, provided a boost to the economy and the education system so all young people gain the skills they need to progress and get a good job.</p>

<p>Further information about the programme and how to apply can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-16-capacity-fund.">GOV.UK</a> website.
