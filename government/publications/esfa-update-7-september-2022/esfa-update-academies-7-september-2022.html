<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: is your governance information up-to-date?</h2>

<p>As the new academic year starts, have you welcomed new members or trustees to your board? Do you have a new chair of trustees, chief financial officer or accounting officer?</p>

<p>The Academy Trust Handbook states trusts must notify DfE of changes to their governance information within 14 calendar days of the change, through the governance section of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Get information about schools</a> (GIAS) register, accessed via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a>.</p>

<p>This requirement includes providing direct contact details for all governance roles.</p>

<p>New chairs of trustees may also need to complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-trust-chair-suitability-checks">suitability check</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: public sector apprenticeships target data</h2>

<p>Public sector apprenticeships target data for 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 needs to be submitted to DfE by Friday 30 September 2022.</p>

<p>All public sector bodies who employ 250 or more staff have a legal requirement to publish their progress against the public sector target and submit this to the department, alongside supporting evidence that demonstrates that they have shown due regard to the target.</p>

<p>Organisations with fewer than 250 staff are not required to submit data.</p>

<p>You can access the form by visiting the ‘Apprenticeships’ tab from the homepage of your Apprenticeship Service account.</p>

<p>You can read more detailed information about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-apprenticeship-target">public sector apprenticeship target</a>, including what data is required.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about how to submit your data return, please contact Apprenticeship Service Support on 0800 0150 600 or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk">helpdesk@manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Reminder: submit your school-led tutoring year end statement by Friday 16 September 2022</h2>

<p>The deadline to submit the year-end statement is 6pm on Friday 16 September 2022.</p>

<p>This is a mandatory return. You need to complete this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">form</a> if your institution received school-led tutoring funding in the 2021 to 2022 academic year, even if you have not used it.</p>

<p>Failure to submit this form will result in your full school-led tutoring programme funding allocation being recovered by ESFA.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage you to watch this tutorial video&nbsp;to help you complete the form along with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-conditions-of-grant">technical</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-year-end-statement">policy guidance</a> (which includes FAQs and scenarios).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/to8_tChnrp8" rel="external">Embed video here</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend you double check your responses before submitting the year end statement. Please check:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you have put the correct figures in the relevant boxes – we ask you to submit the total spend on tutoring and the total number of tutoring hours delivered, please do not enter the same figure for both (unless your spend and hours delivered were equal)</li>
  <li>how much you have spent on school-led tutoring, as your total spend should include both the funding we provided and your school’s contribution - if you used all your funding from DfE, the amount you enter will be higher than your school’s allocation</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more on the school-led tutoring grant on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Reminder: consultation on implementing the direct NFF</h2>

<p>Last call for responses on our consultation on the direct national funding formula (NFF), which closes on Friday 9 September. Following our first consultation last summer, the department confirmed that we plan to determine funding directly for all schools through the NFF. The new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementing-the-direct-national-funding-formula">consultation</a> focuses on some more technical aspects of how the direct NFF could be implemented.</p>

<p>We would be grateful if you gave us your views at and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/funding-policy-unit/implementing-the-direct-national-funding-formula/" rel="external">complete the online survey</a>. We are particularly keen to hear from schools that currently receive split site or exceptional circumstances funding or have received growth or falling rolls funding from their local authority.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: national professional qualifications: targeted support funding for settings with 1 to 600 pupils</h2>

<p>We have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/targeted-support-funding-for-national-professional-qualifications">conditions of grant for the national professional qualifications (NPQs)</a> funding to support teachers and leaders to participate in NPQs.</p>

<p>We know that staff who work in smaller settings can face more barriers to participating in professional development. To support these staff to access NPQs, from autumn 2022 state-funded schools and 16 to 19 organisations with between 1 and 600 pupils will receive £200 for every teacher or leader they employ who takes an NPQ.</p>

<p>These grant payments are in addition to government funded NPQ scholarships.</p>

<p>Teachers and leaders who work in state-funded settings in England are eligible for NPQ scholarships, which cover the training cost of the qualifications.</p>

<p>You can read further information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-professional-qualifications-npqs-reforms">funding available to teachers and leaders taking NPQs</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: statutory guidance on the cost of school uniforms</h2>

<p>In November 2021, the Department for Education published statutory guidance for schools to ensure the cost of school uniforms is reasonable and secures the best value for money. Governing boards should now be compliant with much of the guidance – and fully compliant by Summer 2023. Here are some key actions schools should already have taken:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reviewed their uniform policy against the expectations in the statutory guidance (for example removing unnecessary branded items)</li>
  <li>engaged with parents and pupils when developing/reviewing their policy</li>
  <li>published their uniform policy on the school website</li>
  <li>ensured second hand uniforms are available</li>
  <li>considered any procurement needed to comply with the contract and uniform supplier requirements within the guidance (for example for any branded items) so that school uniforms are ready by summer 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>All schools should be fully complaint with the guidance by summer 2023.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2022/09/01/back-to-school-week-school-uniform-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="external">department’s education hub</a>.</p>
