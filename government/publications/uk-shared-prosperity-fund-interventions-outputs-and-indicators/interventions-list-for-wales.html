<p>We have worked with the Welsh Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to inform the most appropriate mix of interventions for Wales. This engagement has informed the interventions list for each of the three investment priorities of the UKSPF, which are set out below.</p>

<p>Places are encouraged to review the interventions and identify activities that would support UKSPF objectives in their area, including any interventions that are best delivered at a larger scale in collaboration with other places, or more locally. When a larger geographic delivery is more appropriate, we strongly encourage delivery of interventions at this scale. Places should also consider how implementation of the interventions they chose can be adapted to suit local characteristics, reflecting the distinct opportunities and challenges rural, urban and valleys communities face.</p>

<p>Our engagement with partners in Wales has also made clear that local areas should consider their UKSPF investment plans with due regard to the Framework for Regional Investment for Wales. In selecting interventions and developing their UKSPF plans, places are strongly encouraged to consider alignment with relevant Welsh Government strategies and services.  Areas should also develop their plans to maximise alignment and complementarity with national and local policy, and their regional economic frameworks.</p>

<p>In Wales, Multiply will be delivered as part of the single UKSPF investment plan developed by regions. This prospectus has set out the total allocation for each region/local authority linked to Multiply and we will expect areas to set out how they intend to deliver Multiply interventions in line with that level of funding in their UKSPF investment plans. Regional Investment Plans should demonstrate how Multiply interventions will align with Welsh national curriculum and learning approaches, for example the Curriculum for Wales. They should also take account of the aims, objectives and priorities of Multiply when developing local plans for people and skills interventions.</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Boosting core skills and support adults to progress in work, by targeting adults with no or low level qualifications and skills in maths, and upskill the working population, yielding personal and societal economic impact, and by encouraging innovative approaches to reducing adult learning barriers.</li>
  <li>Reducing levels of economic inactivity <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> through investment in bespoke intensive life and employment support tailored to local need. Investment should facilitate the join-up of mainstream provision and local services within an area for participants, through the use of one-to-one keyworker support, improving employment outcomes for specific cohorts who face labour market barriers.
    <ul>
      <li>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to people aged over 50, people with a disability and health condition, women, people from an ethnic minority, young people not in education, employment or training and people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/ offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting people furthest from the labour market to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support, including access to basic skills.</li>
  <li>Supporting local areas to fund gaps in local skills provision to support people to progress in work, and supplement local adult skills provision e.g. by providing additional volumes; delivering provision through wider range of routes or enabling more intensive/innovative provision, both qualification based and non-qualification based. This should be supplementary to provision available through national employment and skills programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interventions</h3>

<h4>Supporting economically inactive people to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support including access to basic skills </h4>

<ul>
  <li>W34: Employment support for economically inactive people: Intensive and wrap-around one-to-one support to move people closer to mainstream provision and to gain and retain employment, supplemented by additional and/or specialist life and basic skills (digital, English, maths* and ESOL) support where there are local provision gaps. Funding for vocational training for economically inactive people, where the provision is additional to that funded via mainstream provision.</li>
</ul>

<p>This provision can include projects promoting the importance of work to help people to live healthier and more independent lives, alongside building their future financial resilience and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/ offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence), people with a disability and health condition, people aged over 50, women, young people not in education, employment or training, and people from an ethnic minority.</p>

<p>*via Multiply.</p>

<h4>Supporting people furthest from the labour market through access to basic skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>W35: Courses including basic skills (digital, English, maths (via Multiply) and ESOL), and life skills and career skills** provision for people who are not economically inactive and who are unable to access other training or wrap around support detailed above. Supplemented by financial support for learners to enrol onto courses and complete qualifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, this intervention will also contribute to building community cohesion and facilitate greater shared civil pride, leading to better integration for those benefitting from ESOL support.</p>

<p>**where not being met through Department for Work and Pensions or Welsh Government provision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>W36: Activities such as enrichment and volunteering to improve opportunities and promote wellbeing.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Skills to progress in work and to fund local skills needs</h4>

<ul>
  <li>W38: Tailored support to help people in employment, who are not supported by mainstream provision to address barriers to accessing education and training courses. This includes supporting the retention of groups who are likely to leave the labour market early.</li>
  <li>W39: Support for local areas to fund local skills needs. This includes technical and vocational qualifications and courses up to level 2 and training for vocational licences relevant to local area needs and high-value qualifications where there is a need for additional skills capacity that cannot be met through mainstream funding.</li>
  <li>W40: Green skills courses targeted around ensuring we have the skilled workforce to achieve the government’s net zero and wider environmental ambitions.</li>
  <li>W41: Retraining and upskilling support for those in high carbon sectors, with a particular focus on transitioning to green, and Industry 4.0 and 5.0 jobs.</li>
  <li>W42: Funding to support local digital skills.</li>
  <li>W43: Funding to support engagement and softer skills development for young people, with regard to the work of Careers Wales/Working Wales.</li>

  <li>W48: Additional relevant maths modules embedded into other vocational courses.</li>
  <li>W49: Innovative programmes delivered together with employers – including courses designed to cover specific numeracy skills required in the workplace.</li>
  <li>W50: New intensive and flexible courses targeted at people without Level 2 maths in Wales, leading to an equivalent qualification (for more information on equivalent qualifications, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/QualificationsCanCrossBoundaries.pdf" rel="external">Qualifications can cross boundaries (sqa.org.uk)</a>)</li>
  <li>W51: Courses designed to help people use numeracy to manage their money.</li>
  <li>W52: Courses aimed at over 19s that are leaving, or have just left, the care system</li>
  <li>W53: Activities, courses or provision developed in partnership with community organisations and other partners aimed at engaging the hardest to reach learners – for example, those not in the labour market or other groups identified locally as in need.</li>

      <p>Economic inactivity refers to those without a job who have not sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work in the next two weeks although in practice many people who are inactive will have been so for a long time. For UKSPF, people and skills investments the term includes people not in work who are on and off benefits, with the exception of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance claimants who are in the all work related requirements legal conditionality groups (i.e. Light Touch and Intensive Work Search).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
