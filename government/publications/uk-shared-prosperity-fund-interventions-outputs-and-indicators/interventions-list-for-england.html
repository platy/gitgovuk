<p>Places are encouraged to review the interventions and identify activities that would support UKSPF objectives in their area, including any interventions that are best delivered at a larger scale in collaboration with other places, or more locally. When a larger geographic delivery is more appropriate, we strongly encourage delivery of interventions at this scale. Places should also consider how implementation of the interventions they chose can be adapted to suit local characteristics, reflecting the distinct opportunities and challenges that different communities face.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>	Communities and place</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Supporting local business</h2>

<p>Lead Authorities should consider segmenting their business population, focusing on specific interventions that will best meet local business need. This can be informed by early engagement with local business representatives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> People and skills</h2>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Boosting core skills and support adults to progress in work, by targeting adults with no or low level qualifications and skills in maths, and upskill the working population, yielding personal and societal economic impact, and by encouraging innovative approaches to reducing adult learning barriers.</li>
  <li>Reducing levels of economic inactivity <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> through investment in bespoke intensive life and employment support tailored to local need. Investment should facilitate the join-up of mainstream provision and local services within an area for participants, through the use of one-to-one keyworker support, improving employment outcomes for specific cohorts who face labour market barriers.
    <ul>
      <li>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to people aged over 50, people with a disability and health condition, women, people from an ethnic minority, young people not in education, employment or training and people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/ offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting people furthest from the labour market to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support, including access to basic skills.</li>
  <li>Supporting local areas to fund gaps in local skills provision to support people to progress in work, and supplement local adult skills provision e.g. by providing additional volumes; delivering provision through wider range of routes or enabling more intensive/innovative provision, both qualification based and non-qualification based. This should be supplementary to provision available through national employment and skills programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interventions</h3>

<h4>Supporting economically inactive people to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support including access to basic skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>E33: Employment support for economically inactive people: Intensive and wrap-around one-to-one support to move people closer towards mainstream provision and employment, supplemented by additional and/or specialist life and basic skills (digital, English, maths* and ESOL) support where there are local provision gaps.</li>
</ul>

<p>This provision can include project promoting the importance of work to help people to live healthier and more independent lives, alongside building future financial resilience and wellbeing. Beyond that, this intervention will also contribute to building community cohesion and facilitate greater shared civil pride, leading to better integration for those benefitting from ESOL support.</p>

<p>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to people aged over 50, people with a disability and health condition, women, people from an ethnic minority, young people not in education, employment or training and people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence).</p>

<p>*via Multiply.</p>

<h4>Supporting people furthest from the labour market through access to basic skills</h4>

<ul>
  <li>E34: Courses including basic skills (digital, English, maths (via Multiply) and ESOL), and life skills and career skills** provision for people who are unable to access training through the adult education budget or wrap around support detailed above. Supplemented by financial support for learners to enrol onto courses and complete qualifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, this intervention will also contribute to building community cohesion and facilitate greater shared civil pride, leading to better integration for those benefitting from ESOL support.</p>

<p>**where not being met through Department for Work and Pensions provision.</p>

<ul>
  <li>E35: Activities such as enrichment and volunteering to improve opportunities and promote wellbeing.</li>
  <li>E36: Intervention to increase levels of digital inclusion, with a focus on essential digital skills, communicating the benefits of getting (safely) online, and in-community support to provide users with the confidence and trust to stay online.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Skills to progress in work and to fund local skills needs</h4>

<ul>
  <li>E37: Tailored support to help people in employment, who are not supported by mainstream provision to address barriers to accessing education and training courses.</li>
  <li>E38: Support for local areas to fund local skills needs. This includes technical and vocational qualifications and courses up to level 2 and training for vocational licences relevant to local area needs and high-value qualifications where there is a need for additional skills capacity that cannot be met through mainstream funding.</li>
  <li>E39: Green skills courses targeted around ensuring we have the skilled workforce to achieve the government’s net zero and wider environmental ambitions.</li>
  <li>E40: Retraining support for those in high carbon sectors.</li>
  <li>E41: Funding to support local digital skills.</li>

      <p>Economic inactivity refers to those without a job who have not sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work in the next two weeks although in practice many people who are inactive will have been so for a long time. For UKSPF, people and skills investments the term includes people not in work who are on and off benefits, with the exception of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance claimants who are in the all work related requirements legal conditionality groups (i.e. Light Touch and Intensive Work Search).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
