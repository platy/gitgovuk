<p>We have engaged with departments across the Northern Ireland Executive so the UK Government can develop a list of interventions aligned to each of the three UKSPF investment priorities. We plan to build on this engagement in the coming months.</p>

<p>The UK Government will take a role in convening partners from across Northern Ireland to develop the UKSPF Investment Plan, considering the investment interventions across the three investment priorities set out below. We will refine the plan in consultation with stakeholders in a way that reflects the needs of Northern Ireland’s economy and society. This group could include representatives from Northern Ireland Executive Departments, local authorities, businesses and the community and voluntary sector.</p>

<p>The plan will be used by the UK Government to inform investment decisions for UKSPF in Northern Ireland, working closely with local partners.</p>

<p>This plan will be developed considering existing funds supported by the UK Government in Northern Ireland, including Peace Plus, the New Decade, New Approach Deal and the Levelling Up Fund. The drafting of the plan will be carried out in consideration of wider Northern Ireland Executive funding and strategies as well as strategies developed in partnership across local authority and City and Growth Deal geographies, such as each local authority’s community plan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	People and skills</h2>

<p>The following, among other relevant plans and strategies, will be considered as the UKSPF plan for Northern Ireland is developed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NI Programme for Government draft Outcomes Framework 2021</li>
  <li>Skills for a 10x Economy - A Draft Skills Strategy for Northern Ireland</li>
  <li>Community Plans</li>
  <li>Local Development Plans</li>
  <li>Generating our Success - the Northern Ireland strategy for youth training</li>
  <li>Active Ageing Strategy</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Boosting core skills and supporting adults to progress in work, by targeting adults with no or low level qualifications and skills in maths, and upskill the working population, yielding personal and societal economic impact, and by encouraging innovative approaches to reducing adult learning barriers.</li>
  <li>Reducing levels of economic inactivity through investment in bespoke intensive life and employment support tailored to local need. Investment should facilitate the join-up of mainstream provision and local services within an area for participants, through the use of one-to-one support, improving employment outcomes for specific cohorts who face labour market barriers.
    <ul>
      <li>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to, people aged over 50, people with a disability and health condition, women, people from an ethnic minority, young people not in education, employment or training and people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/ offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting people furthest from the labour market to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support including access to skills.</li>
  <li>Supporting local areas to fund gaps in local skills provision to support people to progress in work, and supplement local adult skills provision e.g. by providing additional volumes; delivering provision through wider range of routes or enabling more intensive/innovative provision, both qualification based and non-qualification based. This should be supplementary to provision available through national employment and skills programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interventions</h3>

<h4>Supporting economically inactive people to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support including access to basic skills</h4>

      <p>Economic inactivity refers to those without a job who have not sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work in the next two weeks although in practice many people who are inactive will have been so for a long time. For UKSPF, people and skills investments the term includes people not in work who are on and off benefits, with the exception of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance claimants who are in the all work related requirements legal conditionality groups (i.e. Light Touch and Intensive Work Search).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
