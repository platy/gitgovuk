<p>We have worked with the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities to inform the most appropriate mix of interventions for Scotland. This engagement has informed the interventions list for each of the three investment priorities of the UKSPF, which are set out below.</p>

<p>Places are encouraged to review the interventions and identify activities that would support UKSPF objectives in their area, including any interventions that are best delivered at a larger scale in collaboration with other places, or more locally. We strongly encourage that wherever possible interventions that are best delivered at a larger regional scale.</p>

<p>Our engagement with partners in Scotland has also made clear that local areas should also consider their UKSPF investment plans with due regard to Scotland’s National Strategy for Economic Transformation (NSET). Areas should also develop their plans to maximise alignment and complementarity with their own existing local and regional economic strategies, as well as other relevant Scottish strategies, such as the Scottish National Transport Strategy (NTS2), and funding sources provided by the Scottish Government.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Communities and place</h2>

<p>When selecting interventions, areas should also be mindful of how their funding and planning for Communities and Place interventions align with the existing funding streams that they receive from the Scottish Government and key Scottish Government strategies, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vacant and Derelict Land Investment Programme</li>
  <li>Place Based Investment Programme</li>
  <li>Investing in Communities Fund</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Supporting local business</h2>

<p>When selecting interventions, areas should also consider segmenting their business population, focusing on specific interventions that will best meet local business need. This can be informed by early engagement with local business representatives.</p>

<p>Areas in Scotland should also be mindful of how their funding and planning for the investment interventions that support local business aligns with the existing funding streams they receive from the Scottish Government:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> People and skills</h2>

<p>In Scotland, Multiply will be delivered as part of the single UKSPF investment plan developed by areas. This prospectus has set out the total allocation for each Region/Local Authority linked to Multiply and we will expect areas to set out how they intend to deliver Multiply interventions in line with that level of funding in their UKSPF investment plans. They should take account of the aims, objectives and priorities of Multiply when developing local plans for people and skills interventions.</p>

<p>Areas should also be mindful of how their funding and planning for the investment interventions that under the People and Skills pillar aligns with the existing funding streams they receive from the Scottish Government, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No One Left Behind</li>
  <li>Parental Employability Support Fund</li>
  <li>Young Persons Guarantee</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Boosting core skills and support adults to progress in work, by targeting adults with no or low level qualifications and skills in maths, and upskill the working population, yielding personal and societal economic impact, and by encouraging innovative approaches to reducing adult learning barriers</li>
  <li>Reducing levels of economic inactivity<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> through investment in bespoke intensive life and employment support tailored to local need. Investment should facilitate the join-up of mainstream provision and local services within an area for participants, through the use of one-to-one keyworker support, improving employment outcomes for specific cohorts who face labour market barriers.
    <ul>
      <li>Expected cohorts include, but are not limited to people aged over 50, people with a disability and health condition, women, people from an ethnic minority, young people not in education, employment or training and people with multiple complex needs (homeless, care leavers, ex/ offenders, people with substance abuse problems and victims of domestic violence).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supporting people furthest from the labour market to overcome barriers to work by providing cohesive, locally tailored support including access to basic skills.</li>
  <li>Supporting local areas to fund gaps in local skills provision to support people to progress in work, and supplement local adult skills provision e.g. by providing additional volumes; delivering provision through wider range of routes or enabling more intensive/innovative provision, both qualification based and non-qualification based. This should be supplementary to provision available through national employment and skills programmes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alignment with NSET:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Skilled workforce</li>
  <li>Entrepreneurial people and culture</li>
  <li>A fairer and more equal society</li>
  <li>New market opportunities</li>
  <li>Productive businesses and regions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interventions</h3>

  <li>S37: Green skills courses to ensure we have the skilled workforce to support the Just Transition to a net zero economy and climate resilience, with a particular focus on vulnerable or low-income groups who will be disproportionately affected by climate change. Retraining support for those in high carbon sectors, providing career guidance and supporting people to seek employment in other sectors.</li>

      <p>Economic inactivity refers to those without a job who have not sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work in the next two weeks although in practice many people who are inactive will have been so for a long time. For UKSPF, people and skills investments the term includes people not in work who are on and off benefits, with the exception of Universal Credit, Jobseekers Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance claimants who are in the all work related requirements legal conditionality groups (i.e. Light Touch and Intensive Work Search).&nbsp;<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
