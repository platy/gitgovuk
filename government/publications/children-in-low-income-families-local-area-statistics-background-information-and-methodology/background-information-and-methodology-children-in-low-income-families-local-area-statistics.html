<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Context</h2>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/children-in-low-income-families-local-area-statistics">children in low income families (<abbr title="children in low income families">CiLIF</abbr>)</a> statistics, provide information on the number and proportion of children living in Relative and Absolute low income Before Housing Costs by local area across the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Statistics on the number of children (by age) and the proportion of children under 16 in low income families each year are published. Figures are calibrated to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>)</a> survey regional estimates but provide more granular local area information not available from the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> for example, by local authority, parliamentary constituency and Ward.</p>

<h3>Impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on statistics for the financial year ending (<abbr title="financial year ending (FYE)">FYE</abbr>) 2021</h3>

<p>The statistics are calibrated to the regional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>) statistics</a>. A full assessment of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these statistics is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2021">technical report</a>. which should be considered alongside interpretation of these statistics.</p>

<p>While the data for Financial Year Ending (<abbr title="financial year ending (FYE)">FYE</abbr>) 2021 has undergone extensive quality assurance prior to publication, we recommend that users exercise additional caution when using the data for <abbr title="financial year ending (FYE)">FYE</abbr> 2021, particularly when making comparisons with previous years and for local areas across countries.</p>

<p>These statistics replace earlier Official Statistics previously published by Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/children-in-out-of-work-benefit-households--2">Children in out-of-work benefit households</a> and HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/personal-tax-credits-children-in-low-income-families-local-measure-2016-snapshot-as-at-31-august-2016">Children in low-income families local measure</a>. In December 2018, <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> published their respective releases with a commitment to combine releases going forward.</p>

<p>The new combined set of statistics provide a more coherent picture of children in low income families at a local level across the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Purpose</h2>

<p>Sourced from survey data the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> provides estimates of children in low-income families only at national and regional levels. To fill the demand from users for local estimates, administrative data has historically been used to produce Official Statistics on measures such as the number of children in out-of-work benefit households (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>) and children in low income families derived primarily from Tax Credits income data (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>).</p>

<p>With the rollout of Universal Credit and the Higher Income Child Benefit charge, neither measure now offers an accurate view of children in low income families at a local level. Both <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> announced that a new set of statistics would be developed and published to better meet users’ needs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Illustration</h2>

<p>To illustrate what these statistics show.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>In Bexley local authority, 7,500 children under 16 years lived in Relative low-income families in 2020 to 2021 (Relative measure Before Housing Costs).</p>

<p>This represents 15% of children under 16 in Bexley.</p>

<p>Of these 7,500 children, 5,200 (70%) lived in working families and 3,600 (48%) lived in lone parent families.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Methodology</h2>

<p>The methodology underpinning these statistics addresses 3 of the key limitations of the previous official statistics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inclusion of Universal Credit claimants transitioning from Tax Credits</li>
  <li>Calibration to <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> estimates at regional level and by work-status</li>
  <li>Calculation of rates for under 16s, using Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) mid-year population estimates rather than Child Benefit claims which no longer provide a useable proxy given the Higher Income Child Benefit charge</li>
</ol>

<h3>Calibration</h3>

<p>Statistics are calibrated to <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> estimates at regional level and by work status. Thus, the figures will be consistent with <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> regional estimates which use a 3-year average of the number of children in low income families.</p>

<h3>Income</h3>

<p>The number of children in families (not households), Before Housing Costs (<abbr title="income Before Housing Costs">BHC</abbr>) in both Absolute (2010 to 2011 index) and Relative terms is derived from analyses of family income over the entire tax year.</p>

<p>Income is defined as Gross Personal Income from benefits or tax credits, from employment and self-employment, and from occupational pensions.</p>

<p>This is not the same as <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> income measures, but for the purposes of looking at the distribution of family income across local areas, it offers a consistent approach that captures the main income streams.</p>

<p>The Self Employment Income Support Scheme (<abbr title="Self Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr>) data has not been used in the derivation of the income measures for the self-employed for the FYE2021. This is because the <abbr title="Self Employment Income Support Scheme">SEISS</abbr> amount is generated on a different basis to Self Assessment. All Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (<abbr title="All Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>) payments are paid via the PAYE system as part of weekly or monthly earnings and thus form part of the income measure.</p>

<h3>Equivalisation</h3>

<p>In order to allow comparisons of the living standards of different types of households, income is adjusted to account for variations in the size and composition of the households in a process known as equivalisation. This assumes that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. Thus, all members of any one household will appear at the same point in the income distribution.</p>

<p>Equivalence scales conventionally take an adult couple without children as the reference point, with an equivalence value of one. The process then increases relatively the income of single person households (since their incomes are divided by a value of less than one) and reduces relatively the incomes of households with three or more persons, which have an equivalence value of greater than one.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>Statistics are derived from the database “<abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr>” (Registration and Population Interaction Database) which provides a single coherent view of citizens’ interactions with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> within a tax year. Relationships are built from analyses of household benefits. That is, information on sole or joint claimants of Universal Credit, Tax Credits and Housing Benefits payments which is used to determine claimant and partner information. When combined with Child Benefit claimant data, this view provides a measure of the family unit.</p>

<p>The methodology accounts for changes in family composition throughout the year (for example re-partnering, multiple partners, becoming a sole parent) by tracking these changes in benefit claims and the associated personal income of claimants and partners.</p>

<h3>Time-series</h3>

<p>Statistics on the number of children in low income families from 2014 to 2021 are published. Limitations in the coverage of <abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr> mean that earlier statistics using this methodology are not available. In addition, figures for the latest year are provisional as some self-employment data from the previous year is used as a proxy to fill in gaps in timely recording.</p>

<h3>Building local areas</h3>

<p>Consistent with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>’s approach to building local area statistics, Census Output Area (<abbr title="Census Output Area">COA</abbr>) is used as the building block to derive standard geographies including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lower Layer Super Output Area (<abbr title="Lower Super Output Area">LSOA</abbr>) GB only</li>
  <li>Middle Layer Super Output Area (<abbr title="Middle Super Output Area">MSOA</abbr>) GB only</li>
  <li>Ward</li>
  <li>(Higher Tier) Local Authority</li>
  <li>Westminster Parliamentary Constituency</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work status</h3>

<p><abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr> provides weekly views of income and hours worked from employment and self-employment over the tax year. For the purposes of these statistics, “in-work” status is defined as a family who, combined, have had employment or self-employment for more than 26 weeks of the tax year.</p>

<h3>Rates</h3>

<p>Rates have been derived by dividing the number of children aged 0 to 15 in low income families by the number of all children aged 0-15 (sourced from <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> mid-year population estimates). Rates for all children (aged 0 to 19) have not been produced as a proportion on 16 to 19 year olds would not be treated as children for the purposes of these statistics.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Data source</h2>

<p>These statistics draw data from the database “<abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr>” (Registration and Population Interaction Database) which provides a single coherent view of citizens’ interactions with <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> and <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> within a tax year for the UK. <abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr> provides a basis for analyses of children, the family unit, and gross personal incomes (benefits/tax credits, employment, self-employment, occupational pensions) from which estimates of the number of children in low income families can be derived calibrated to <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> regional estimates on Absolute and Relative definitions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr> is based on 100% extracts of various <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> benefit systems and is supplemented with 100% data extracts from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> systems. <abbr title="Registration and Population Interaction Database">RAPID</abbr> collates information on individual activities (and the income generated from those activities) within each tax year, including benefit, employment and in-work benefit interactions, for example Tax Credits and Housing Benefit. Children have been identified from <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> Child Benefit scans.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Revisions</h2>

<p>The statistics reflect revisions to previously published statistics. Statistics for 2019 to 2020 were badged as provisional and have now been updated based on more complete information for that year. In addition, improvements to the historic coverage of benefits (for example the inclusion of Bereavement Support Payments data) and technical improvements to the methodology mean that all data from 2014 is subject to small levels of revision. Geographies have also been updated to reflect the National Statistics Postcode Lookup for May 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Interpretation of the statistics</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the statistics are calibrated to the regional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income (<abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr>) statistics</a>. A full assessment of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these statistics is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/households-below-average-income-for-financial-years-ending-1995-to-2021">technical report</a>, which should be considered alongside interpretation of these statistics</li>
  <li>while the data for <abbr title="financial year ending (FYE)">FYE</abbr> 2021 has undergone extensive quality assurance prior to publication, we recommend that users exercise additional caution when using the data for <abbr title="financial year ending (FYE)">FYE</abbr> 2021, particularly when making comparisons with previous years and for local areas across countries</li>
  <li>the statistics are not directly comparable with the previous statistics produced by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr> for the reasons outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-3">section 3</a>
</li>
  <li>the statistics are calibrated and will match 3-year average <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> published estimates of children in low-income families at national and regional level</li>
  <li>they are designed to provide local area insights for small geographical areas</li>
  <li>whilst the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> estimates are built from a survey of households, these administrative statistics cover the family unit as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-6">section 6</a>
</li>
  <li>statistics are available for individual ages of children 0 to 19. Rates are calculated for children under 16 for both the numerator and denominator</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Uses of the data</h2>

<p>Uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to meet the demand from users for local estimates of the number and proportion of children living in low income families to enable strategic decision making and allocation of services at local levels</li>
  <li>to compare and contrast changes in the number and proportion of children in low-income families across local areas within the same country</li>
  <li>to do so in a way that accounts for the rollout of Universal Credit to produce consistent statistics from 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>Strengths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calibrated to (and therefore match) 3-year average <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> estimates of children in low-income families at the national and regional level</li>
  <li>provide local area insights for low level geographies</li>
  <li>whilst the <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> estimates are built from a survey of households, these administrative statistics covering the family unit, are derived from analyses of multiple administrative sources of benefit, tax credit, and earnings data</li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the statistics are a measure of children and cannot be used to obtain the number of low-income families</li>
  <li>a family must have claimed Child Benefit and at least one other household benefit (Universal Credit, tax credits or Housing Benefit) at any point in the year to be classed as low income in these statistics</li>
  <li>income is Before Housing Costs (<abbr title="income Before Housing Costs">BHC</abbr>) and is equivalised to adjust for family size and composition. Income is defined as Gross Personal Income from benefits/tax credits, from employment and self-employment, and from occupational pensions. This is not the same as <abbr title="Households Below Average Income">HBAI</abbr> income measures, but for the purposes of looking at the distribution of family income across local areas, it offers a consistent approach that captures the main income streams</li>
  <li>relationships are built from analyses of household benefits in payment. That is, information on sole or joint claimants of Universal Credit, Tax Credits and Housing Benefits which is used to determine claimant and partner information. When combined with Child Benefit claimant data, this view provides a measure of the family unit</li>
  <li>the statistics are not directly comparable with the predecessor of these statistics produced by <abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>
</li>
</ul>
