<p>This notice sets out the procedures to be followed and provides for an opportunity to be heard before any correction is made.</p>

<p>We have become aware that we have recorded the incorrect filing date and registration date in respect of the following registered design 6042116. The filing date and registration date shall be corrected from 01/09/2018 to 22/08/2018.</p>

<h3>Opportunity to object</h3>

<p>To make this correction we are using the process set out at section 21 of the Registered Designs Act 1949. Under this process, owners of registered designs, an applicant for the registration of a design, and others who have an interest, may request a hearing if they do not think the register should be corrected. We will offer this opportunity when we write to the owners of affected designs (or their representative).</p>

<p>If you have an interest in the registered design and are not the owner of the right, you must contact us within 28 days from the date of this notice if you would like a hearing. A hearing is a formal process where you will be given the opportunity to explain your case to a senior official known as a Hearing Officer.</p>

<h3>When the correction will be made</h3>

<p>The correction will be made after the 28 days to request a hearing has expired. The corrected information will be visible on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/search-registered-design">Find a registered design service</a>.</p>

<p>We are very sorry for any inconvenience this error may have caused. If you have queries regarding this notice, please contact us on the following email address: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:designs.managers@ipo.gov.uk">designs.managers@ipo.gov.uk</a>.</p>
