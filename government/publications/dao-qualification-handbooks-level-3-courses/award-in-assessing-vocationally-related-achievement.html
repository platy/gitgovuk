<h2>Centre requirements</h2>

<p>Centres offering this qualification must have approval from the Defence Awarding Organisation.</p>

<p>The assessment centre must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that there are sufficient people trained or qualified to assess the number of learners they anticipate to register and qualify</li>
  <li>provide quality assured training for those people identified as being responsible for assessing learners</li>

  <li>provide quality assured assessment that meets the requirements of the Defence Awarding Organisation for those people identified as being responsible for internal quality assurance</li>
  <li>ensure that there is a system of standardisation in place to ensure that all assessments are consistent and fair</li>
  <li>ensure that those undertaking the roles of quality assurance and assessment maintain their skills, knowledge and competence</li>
  <li>comply with the requirements of the Defence Awarding Organisation and the qualifications Regulators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Centres offering this qualification must provide internal quality assurance to ensure assessment meets all the Defence Awarding Organisation requirements and is standardised across individual assessors, assessment locations and learners.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<h3>Assessors</h3>

<p>All assessors must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>be occupationally competent.  This means that each assessor must, according to current sector practice, be competent in the functions covered by the units they are assessing.  They will have gained their occupational competence working within the Defence sector or within an appropriate occupational sector.  They are not required to occupy a position in the organisation more senior than that of the Learner they are assessing.  However, Centres must be alert to the risks that all such arrangements could present and ensure that sufficient quality controls are in place through the internal quality assurance process to minimise the possibility of collusion between learners and assessors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to demonstrate consistent application of the skills and the current supporting knowledge and understanding in the context of a recent role directly related to the qualification units they are assessing as a practitioner, trainer or manager</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be familiar with the qualification units; and must be able to interpret and make judgements on current working practices and technologies within the area of work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain their occupational competence by actively engaging in continuous professional development activities in order to keep up-to-date with developments relating to the changes taking place in the Defence sector.  These activities may include those offered by the Awarding Organisation or other relevant providers in the sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be appropriately qualified or be able to prove equivalent competence as specified in the relevant SSC Assessment Strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>approved Centres will be required to provide the Defence Awarding Organisation with current evidence of how each assessor meets these requirements; for example certificates of achievement, testimonials, references or any other relevant records.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Internal quality assurance</h3>

<p>All Internal Quality Assurers must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>be occupationally knowledgeable across the range of units for which they are responsible prior to commencing the role.  Due to the risk-critical nature of the work and the legal implications of the assessment process, they must understand the nature and context of the assessors’ work and that of their Learners.  This means that they must have worked closely with staff that carry out the functions covered by the qualifications, possibly by training or supervising them, and have sufficient knowledge of these functions to be able to offer credible advice on the interpretation of the units.  Those conducting internal quality assurance must also sample the assessment process and resolve differences and conflicts on assessment decisions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understand the content, structure and assessment requirements for the qualification they are quality assuring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintain their occupational competence by actively engaging in continuous professional development activities in order to keep up-to-date with developments relating to the changes taking place in the Defence sector.  These activities may include those offered by the Defence Awarding Organisation or other relevant providers in the sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be appropriately qualified or be able to prove equivalent competence as specified in the relevant SSC Assessment Strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>occupy a position in the organisation that gives them the authority and resources to coordinate the work of assessors, provide authoritative advice, call meetings as appropriate, visit and observe assessment practice, and carry out all the other important roles of internal quality assurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have an appropriate induction to the qualifications that they are quality assuring, provided to them by the Centre, and have access to ongoing training and updates on current issues relevant to these qualifications.  Information on the induction and continuing professional development of carrying out internal quality assurance must be made available to the Awarding Organisation through its external quality assurance process.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Workplace assessment</h3>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation believes that direct observation by a competent assessor (as outlined above) or testimony from an Expert Witness is always preferable.</p>

<p>Expert Witness testimony has parity with assessor observation unless otherwise stated in unit evidence requirements.  The assessor is responsible for making the final judgement in terms of the Learner meeting the evidence requirements for the unit.</p>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation recognise that there are alternative evidence sources which may be used where direct observation is not possible or practical, e.g. work products, records, reflective accounts, professional discussion etc.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that the evidence used to assess Learners is valid, all Centres must demonstrate that Learners have access to the types of resources commonly in use in the sector and that the pressures and constraints of the workplace are reflected.</p>

<p>It is accepted that the assessment of some knowledge and understanding may take place in a different environment, for example in a training and development centre or another environment, which is not the immediate workplace.  However, the assessment of this knowledge and understanding should be linked directly to workplace performance and should include performance evidence.</p>

<h3>The expert witnesses</h3>

<p>When using Expert Witnesses as a source of evidence, Expert Witnesses must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>be occupationally competent.  This means that each Expert Witness must, according to current sector practice, be competent in the functions covered by the units to which they are contributing.  They will have gained their occupational competence working within the Defence sector or within an appropriate occupational sector</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be able to demonstrate consistent application of the skills and the current supporting knowledge and understanding in the context of a recent role directly related to the qualification unit that they are witnessing as a practitioner, trainer or manager</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be familiar with the qualification unit; and must be able to interpret current working practices and technologies within the area of work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Use of languages</h3>

<p>The Defence Awarding Organisation conducts its business activities in English and the qualification handbook for these qualifications is provided in English.</p>

<h3>Simulations</h3>

<p>Assessment in a simulated environment should only be used in the following circumstances:</p>

<ol>
  <li>where evidence in the workplace will not be demonstrated within an acceptable time frame</li>
  <li>where the nature of the work activity presents high risk or danger to the Learner and others, for example, personal safety.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simulations must be agreed between the Defence Awarding Organisation and the Centre contact from the Assessment Centre prior to use.</p>

<p>All simulations should follow these basic principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Centre’s overall strategy for simulation must be agreed and approved by the Defence Awarding Organisation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the nature of the contingency and the physical environment for the simulation must be realistic and Learners should be given no indication as to exactly what contingencies they may come across</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where simulations are used they must reflect the requirements of the qualification units</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the location and environment of simulation must be agreed between the Defence Awarding Organisation and the Centre contact prior to it taking place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all simulations must be planned, developed and documented by the Centre in a way that ensures the simulation correctly reflects what the specific qualification unit seeks to assess and all simulations should follow these documented plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There should be a range of simulations to cover the same aspect of a unit so that the risk of Learners successfully colluding is reduced.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>External quality assurance</h3>

<p>The monitoring and standardisation of assessment decisions will be achieved by robust and strong Centre monitoring and quality assurance according to the Defence Awarding Organisation requirements.</p>

<p>The mechanisms required to achieve these requirements are outlined in Ofqual’s ‘Regulatory arrangements for the Qualifications and Credit Framework’.  In addition to the Regulator’s requirements, the Defence Awarding Organisation will evaluate all external quality assurance reports and other data relating to the Centre and any risks relating to quality control will be identified and addressed.</p>

<p>External quality assurers (EQA) will be appointed by the Defence Awarding Organisation to approve centres and to monitor the assessment and internal quality assurance carried out by centres.  External quality assurance is carried out to ensure that there is validity, reliability and good practice in centres.  To carry out their quality assurance role, quality assurance staff must have appropriate occupational and verifying knowledge and expertise.  The Defence Awarding Organisation quality assurance staff will attend training and development designed to keep them up-to-date, to facilitate standardisation between staff and share good practice.
