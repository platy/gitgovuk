<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This handbook describes the main activities that inspectors carry out when they inspect further education and skills providers in England under part 8 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. It sets out the evaluation criteria that inspectors use to make their judgements and on which they report. This  handbook applies to inspections under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>2.	The handbook has 2 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1. How further education and skills providers will be inspected: this contains information about the processes before, during and after inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2. The evaluation schedule: this contains the evaluation criteria inspectors use to judge the quality and standards of further education and skills providers and the main types of evidence used</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>3.	This handbook is a guide for inspectors on how to carry out inspections of further education and skills providers. It is also available to providers and other organisations to inform them about inspection processes and procedures. It balances the need for consistent inspections with the need to respond to each provider’s individual circumstances. Inspectors will apply their professional judgement when they use this handbook.</p>

<h3>Types of providers subject to inspection covered by this handbook</h3>

<p>4.	The providers we inspect under the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and using this handbook are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>further education colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth-form colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>independent specialist colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dance and drama colleges<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>independent learning providers (including those delivering apprenticeship training up to and including level 7)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local authority providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>designated institutions<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>employer providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>higher education institutions that provide further education and/or apprenticeship training up to and including level 7<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup> (to the extent of this provision only)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>16 to 19 academies/free schools</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5.	The term ‘further education and skills provider’ covers all of these types of provider and all of the types of provision set out in detail at <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-type">paragraph 86</a> (education programmes for young people, adult learning, apprenticeship provision at all levels, and provision for high needs learners). Apprenticeship training at all levels is understood to be part of skills training.</p>

<p>6.	‘Learner’ is a collective term used throughout this handbook to refer to any person aged 16 or over (or, where relevant, 14 or 15 years old) whether they are a student, an apprentice or similar, who is in education or training of the kind set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-type">paragraph 86</a>.</p>

<p>7.	‘Teacher’ is a collective term used throughout this handbook to refer to teachers, trainers, lecturers, mentors, assessors and staff in similar roles.</p>

<h3>Gathering personal information on inspection</h3>

<p>8.	Inspectors will gather any personal information necessary to assist them in inspecting a provider. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/further-education-and-skills-ofsted-privacy-notice">privacy policy</a> sets out what personal information we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it and individuals’ rights under data protection legislation.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup></p>

<p>9.	Individuals and organisations are legally required to provide inspectors with access to information. Section 131 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 gives our inspectors powers of entry to any premises on which a provider provides education or training, and any premises of the provider used in connection with its provision of education or training. Section 132 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 gives our inspectors a power to take copies of, or take away, any records and documents relating to the education and training being inspected. This power enables inspectors to look at computers and other devices that may hold information.</p>

<p>10.	Inspectors gather evidence at inspection and record this on Ofsted’s systems. They may also see evidence on site that contains personal information about staff and learners. Inspectors may, if necessary, take notes from, or copies of, evidence containing personal information. Any notes or copies will be stored as evidence securely and not retained by inspectors personally. Inspectors may take photographs of learners’ work. These photographs will be stored securely as evidence, but will not be retained by the inspector personally. In most providers, inspectors will gather evidence electronically using a range of devices, including laptops, mobile phones and tablets. Inspectors should transfer evidence securely in line with our security policies.</p>

<h2>Part 1. How further education and skills providers will be inspected</h2>

<h2>How providers are selected for inspection</h2>

<p>11.	To decide when we should next inspect a provider, we use the ‘frequency of inspection’ guidance set out below. We also use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-assessment-methodology-for-further-education-and-skills-providers">risk assessment</a> to ensure that our approach to inspection is proportionate, so that we can focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact.</p>

<p>12.	We use a broad range of information to assess risk and performance when selecting providers for inspection. This process applies in particular to good or outstanding providers. The indicators include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>previous inspection records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>self-assessment reports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>performance data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>destination data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information provided, or concerns raised, by a funding body, a government regulator, a professional, statutory or regulatory body, or an employer, parent, carer or learner</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the views of learners and employers, gathered through online questionnaires</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relevant local intelligence, such as changes to leaders or structures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any information about significant changes to the type of provision and the number of learners in a provider</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the size and complexity of a provider, including the number and types of provision, the geographical spread of education or training centres and any recent changes to these</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the outcomes of monitoring visits or any other related activity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>13.	We can use relevant information received at any point during the year to select providers. We will review this information regularly.</p>

<h2>Frequency of inspection</h2>

<p>14.	Inspection intervals have been extended where necessary due to the suspension of routine inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020. The time extensions are detailed in footnotes. Further changes to inspection timescales took effect from April 2022 onwards, following the government’s spending review. These are detailed throughout this section.</p>

<h3>Providers judged outstanding</h3>

<p>15.	Providers judged outstanding for overall effectiveness at their most recent inspection are now all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ofsted-inspection-removal-of-the-outstanding-exemption">subject to routine inspection</a>.</p>

<p>16.	Those judged to be outstanding at their previous inspection before September 2015 will normally receive a full inspection. We will prioritise these inspections.</p>

<p>17.	The following types of provider will receive a full inspection between September 2022 and September 2025 in any case if currently graded outstanding (or any other grade):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>further education colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth-form colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>designated institutions (including specialist designated institutions)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This full inspection will be enhanced to cover in more depth the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs and a sub-judgement will be made on the college’s contribution (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#skills-needs">paragraphs 291 to 304</a>).</p>

<p>18.	Any outstanding provider delivering apprenticeship training (and not covered in <a class="govuk-link" href="#outstanding-types-provider">paragraph 17</a>) will receive a full inspection by September 2025, unless it has already had a full inspection since April 2021.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>19.	For any providers that are not covered in <a class="govuk-link" href="#outstanding-types-provider">paragraphs 17 and 18</a>, the following will apply. Those judged to be outstanding at their previous inspection before September 2015 will normally receive a full inspection by September 2025, which we will prioritise, unless they have already had a full inspection since April 2021. Those providers judged outstanding from September 2015 onwards at their previous inspection will normally receive a short inspection by September 2025, unless they have already had an inspection since April 2021. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#short-inspections-175">section on short inspections (paragraphs 175 to 206)</a>.</p>

<p>20.	Any outstanding provider in the following categories will receive an inspection as set out in paragraph 19:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>independent specialist colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local authority providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>higher education institutions that provide further education and/or apprenticeship training up to and including level 7 (to the extent of this provision only)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This inspection will be within 6 years of the report publication date of their previous inspection or by September 2025, whichever is the sooner.</p>

<p>21.	Subsequent inspections of an outstanding provider would normally take place within 6 years of the publication of the inspection report of a provider being judged to be outstanding overall. A provider judged as outstanding may also be inspected as part of our survey or research work, or through a monitoring visit.</p>

<h3>Providers judged good</h3>

<p>22.	Providers judged good for overall effectiveness at their most recent inspection will normally be inspected within 5 years of the publication of their previous inspection report (extended to 7 years where the suspension of routine inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on inspection activity). All good providers will be inspected between April 2021 and September 2025.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup></p>

<p>23.	The following types of provider will receive a full inspection between September 2022 and September 2025 in any case if currently graded good (or any other grade):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>further education colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth-form colleges</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>designated institutions (including specialist designated institutions)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This full inspection will be enhanced to cover in more depth the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs and a sub-judgement will be made on the college’s contribution (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#skills-needs">paragraphs 291 to 304</a>).</p>

<p>24.	Any good provider delivering apprenticeship training (and not covered in <a class="govuk-link" href="#full-inspection-types">paragraph 23</a>) will receive a full inspection by September 2025 (unless it has already had a full inspection since April 2021).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>25.	For any providers that are not covered in <a class="govuk-link" href="#full-inspection-types">paragraphs 23 and 24</a>, the following will apply. They will normally receive a short inspection by September 2025 (unless they have had an inspection since April 2021). However, they may receive a full inspection if information suggests that this is the most appropriate way forward. This includes, for example, if there are concerns about safeguarding, if the provider’s performance has declined or if its provision has changed substantially. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#short-inspections-175">section on short inspections (paragraphs 175 to 206)</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#selecting-providers">paragraphs 11 to 13</a> on selecting providers. A good provider may also be inspected as part of our survey or research work, or through a monitoring visit.</p>

<h3>Providers judged to require improvement</h3>

<p>26.	Providers judged to require improvement at their most recent inspection will normally receive a full inspection within 12 to 30 months of the publication of their previous inspection report.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup> These providers will normally be subject to a monitoring visit before the full inspection, normally 7 to 13 months after the publication of their previous inspection report (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-RI">paragraph 64</a>).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

<p>27.	If the provider is a further education college, a sixth-form college or a designated institution, this full inspection will be enhanced to cover in more depth the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs and a sub-judgement will be made on the college’s contribution (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#skills-needs">paragraphs 291 to 304</a>).</p>

<h3>Providers judged inadequate</h3>

<p>28.	Providers judged inadequate will receive re-inspection monitoring visits, as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-inadequate">paragraphs 65 to 67</a>. These providers will then receive a full inspection (known as a ‘re-inspection’) within 15 months of publication of their previous full inspection report, provided they continue to be funded.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup> The major exceptions to this are providers that no longer receive their main funding or that have been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/removal-from-register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers">removed from the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers (<abbr title="Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers">RoATP</abbr>)</a> and deliver only apprenticeship provision. From that point, neither a re-inspection monitoring visit nor a full re-inspection will normally take place. If a provider has apprenticeship provision graded inadequate and has also been removed from the <abbr title="Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers">RoATP</abbr> but still has other substantial funding, that apprenticeship provision will not normally be covered as part of the re-inspection monitoring visit and subsequent re-inspection.</p>

<p>29.	If the provider is a further education college, a sixth-form college or a designated institution, this full inspection will be enhanced to cover in more depth the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs and a sub-judgement will be made on the college’s contribution (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#skills-needs">paragraphs 291 to 304</a>).</p>

<h3>New providers</h3>

<p>30.	We will normally carry out a monitoring visit to any provider that becomes newly, directly and publicly funded to deliver education and/or training.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">[footnote 12]</a></sup> This funding may be received from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (<abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>), from a mayoral or combined authority (<abbr title="mayoral or combined authority">MCA</abbr>) or the Greater London Authority (<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>) in the case of adult education, or through the apprenticeship levy. The monitoring visit will normally take place within 24 months of the provider starting to deliver directly funded provision.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup> New providers starting to deliver provision from April 2021 onwards will normally receive their new provider monitoring visit within 18 months of starting to deliver. For more details about monitoring visits, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-visits">paragraphs 54 to 63</a>.</p>

<p>31.	New providers will normally receive their first full inspection within 24 months of the publication of their monitoring visit report.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> From April 2022 onwards, new providers will normally receive their first full inspection within 18 months of the publication of their monitoring visit report. That will apply to providers whose monitoring visit reports were published from 1 April 2022 onwards. When a provider receives one, or more than one, judgement of insufficient progress at its monitoring visit  , it will normally receive a full inspection within 6 to 12 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report. We may carry out a full inspection of these providers without carrying out a monitoring visit, where appropriate.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>32.	If a provider has made insufficient progress in safeguarding, it will normally receive one further monitoring visit to review only its safeguarding arrangements within 4 months of the publication date of its previous monitoring visit report.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Providers with level 6/7 apprenticeship provision</h3>

<p>33.	Since 1 April 2021, Ofsted has been responsible for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gavin-williamson-education-secretary-letter-to-her-majestys-chief-inspector">inspecting apprenticeship training</a> (as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-type">paragraph 86</a>) at levels 6 and 7 (both degree and non-degree) as well as at levels 2 to 5.</p>

<p>34.	How this affects providers in different categories is set out below.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Providers with level 6/7 apprenticeship provision that have already received a full inspection</h4>

<p>35.	This relates to existing providers that have already received a full Ofsted inspection (whether under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> or previous inspection frameworks) and that deliver level 6/7 apprenticeship training. When they next receive a full or short inspection or monitoring visit, we will inspect their level 6/7 apprenticeship provision alongside any level 2 to 5 apprenticeship provision and any other provision they deliver subject to Ofsted inspection (as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-type">paragraph 86</a>). The timing of their inspection will depend on their overall effectiveness grade, as usual and as set out above.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Providers with level 6/7 apprenticeship provision and no other provision subject to Ofsted education inspection</h4>

<p>36.	Providers that only deliver apprenticeship provision at levels 6 and 7, and have been delivering no other provision that is subject to Ofsted inspection (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-type">paragraph 86</a>), will be regarded as a new provider from April 2021. New providers of levels 6 and 7 only provision   will normally receive their first new provider monitoring visit within 18 months of 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>37.	These providers will then receive a full inspection. This will take place within 24 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report where this was published prior to April 2022, and within 18 months where this was published from April 2022 onwards. When a provider receives one, or more than one, judgement of insufficient progress at its monitoring visit,    it will normally receive a full inspection within 6 to 12 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report. <a class="govuk-link" href="#insufficient-progress-safeguarding">Paragraph 32</a> will also apply where a provider has made insufficient progress in safeguarding.</p>

<h4>New providers with level 6/7 apprenticeship provision that have not yet received their monitoring visit or full inspection</h4>

<p>38.	New providers that deliver apprenticeship provision at levels 6 and 7 as well as at levels 2 to 5, and have not previously received a monitoring visit or a full inspection, will normally receive a monitoring visit within 36 months of the date they started to deliver apprenticeship provision (on account of COVID-19). New providers starting to deliver any apprenticeship provision (or other relevant funded provision) for the first time from April 2021 onwards will normally receive their new provider monitoring visit within 18 months of starting to deliver (see paragraph 30). The monitoring visit will take account of apprenticeship provision at all levels.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<p>39.	These providers will then receive a full inspection. This will take place within 24 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report where this was published prior to April 2022, and within 18 months where this was published from April 2022 onwards. When a provider receives one, or more than one, judgement of insufficient progress at its monitoring visit,     the full inspection will usually be within 6 to 12 months. <a class="govuk-link" href="#insufficient-progress-safeguarding">Paragraph 32</a> will also apply where a provider has made insufficient progress in safeguarding.</p>

<h4>New providers with level 6/7 apprenticeship provision that have received a new provider monitoring visit, but not a full inspection</h4>

<p>40.	New providers that have received their first new provider monitoring visit, but have not yet received their full inspection, will normally receive this within 40 months of the date of publication of their new provider monitoring visit if the new provider monitoring visit happened before April 2021. The full inspection will take place within 24 months of the publication of the monitoring visit report if this was published prior to April 2022 but after April 2021, and within 18 months where this was published from April 2022 onwards.</p>

<h3>Newly merged colleges</h3>

<p>41.	A newly merged college will normally receive a full inspection within 3 years of the merger.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup> This will normally be a full inspection. For inspection purposes, regardless of the type of merger, we view all merged colleges as new colleges.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> A newly merged college will not carry forward any inspection grades from predecessor colleges. It will have no inspection grade until the first full inspection.</p>

<p>42.	Any newly merged college may receive a monitoring visit at any reasonable time. A newly merged college will normally receive a monitoring visit before the first full inspection if the overall effectiveness grade of one or more of the predecessor colleges was requires improvement or inadequate.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> These monitoring visits will focus on relevant themes about the progress of the merged college, including from the most recent report(s) of the predecessor college(s). Monitoring visits will normally arrive at progress judgements against these themes as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-visits-judgements">paragraph 56</a>. The monitoring visit report will normally be published. Concerns about risks arising from this or other sources may lead to an earlier full inspection.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Sixth-form colleges that convert to become 16 to 19 academies</h3>

<p>43.	Sixth-form colleges that convert to become 16 to 19 academies will be treated   according to their most recent inspection outcome. Those that were judged outstanding will receive either a full or short inspection by September 2025, unless they have had an inspection since April 2021 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#outstanding-full-inspection">paragraph 19</a>). Those that were good will normally receive a short inspection within 7 years of the publication of their previous inspection report, and certainly by September 2025 (unless they have had an inspection since April 2021), but may receive a full inspection within that time frame if risks are identified (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#providers-good">paragraph 25</a>). Those judged as requires improvement will normally be inspected within 12 to 30 months of the publication of the previous report. They will normally receive a monitoring visit within 7 to 13 months of the publication of the previous report (as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#providers-RI">paragraphs 26</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-RI">64</a>). Those judged inadequate will normally be inspected within 15 months of the publication of the report of the previous inspection of the converted college.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup> They will normally receive re-inspection monitoring visits as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#providers-inadequate">paragraphs 28</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-inadequate">65 to 67</a>. A 16 to 19 academy/free school that is re-brokered (transferred to a new sponsor) for performance reasons will be treated as a new provider from the point of re-brokerage for the purposes of inspection.</p>

<h2>Types of inspection</h2>

<h3>Full inspection</h3>

<p>44.	Providers that are graded as requires improvement or inadequate will undergo a full inspection as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#providers-RI">paragraphs 26 and 28</a>. Inspectors grade the overall effectiveness, the types of provision and the other key judgements areas in accordance with the criteria and grade descriptors set out in part 2 of this handbook.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p>45.	Providers judged as outstanding will have a full inspection if they fall into the categories set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#judged-outstanding">paragraphs 16 to 18</a>.</p>

<p>46.	Providers judged as good will have a full inspection if they fall into the categories set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#full-inspection-types">paragraphs 23 and 24</a>. They may also have a full inspection if they fall into the category of provider as set out in paragraph 25 if, for example, there are concerns about safeguarding, their performance has declined or the provision in scope for inspection has changed substantially.</p>

<p>47.	New providers will receive a full inspection once they have had a new provider monitoring visit as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#new-providers">paragraphs 30 to 32</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#apprenticeship-provision">36 to 40</a>.</p>

<p>48.	Ofsted reserves the right to carry out a full inspection of any provider at any reasonable time.</p>

<h3>Short inspections</h3>

<p>49.	Providers judged good at their previous inspection will normally receive a full inspection if they fall into categories set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#full-inspection-types">paragraphs 23 and 24</a>. They will normally receive a short inspection, but may receive a full inspection if they fall into categories set out in paragraph 25.</p>

<p>50.	Providers judged outstanding whose previous inspection took place before September 2015 will normally receive a short inspection next providing that they do not fall into the categories set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#outstanding-types-provider">paragraphs 17 and 18</a>.</p>

<p>51.	A short inspection will determine primarily whether the quality of education/training that learners receive is good (in the case of a good provider) or outstanding (in the case of an outstanding provider). For information about short inspections, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#short-inspections-175">paragraphs 175 to 206</a> of this handbook.</p>

<h3>Enhanced inspections of colleges</h3>

<p>52.	From September 2022, inspections of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions (including specialist designated institutions) will be full inspections. They will also be enhanced to cover in more detail the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs, including a sub-judgement on the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs. This is covered in more detail in <a class="govuk-link" href="#skills-needs">paragraphs 291 to 304</a>.</p>

<h3>Survey and research visits</h3>

<p>53.	We may visit any provider as part of our surveys and research work, based on our national priorities. We may carry out visits at any reasonable time  . Ofsted may also undertake research activity during inspections.</p>

<h3>Monitoring visits</h3>

<p>54.	A monitoring visit is an interim type of inspection that explores one, or more than one, specific theme. The purpose of a monitoring visit is to assess progress against these themes to encourage improvement, assess risk and measure progress. We may carry out a monitoring visit of any provider at any reasonable time. For example, if we have significant cause for concern, such as about safeguarding or a breakdown in leadership and management, we may carry out a monitoring visit focused on that specific issue.</p>

<p>55.	Providers will normally receive 2 working days’ notice of a monitoring visit, although they may be unannounced where that is considered appropriate. They will normally last up to 2 days on site. They will normally result in a published monitoring visit report. Concerns arising from monitoring visits may lead to an earlier full inspection or to a further monitoring visit as appropriate.</p>

<p>56.	We will normally use one of the following progress judgements on monitoring visits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>insufficient progress: progress has been either slow or insubstantial or both, and the demonstrable impact on learners has been negligible<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reasonable progress: the provider’s actions are already having a beneficial impact on learners, and improvements are sustainable and are based on the provider’s thorough quality assurance procedures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>significant progress: progress has been rapid and is already having considerable beneficial impact on learners</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>57.	Monitoring visits follow a similar process to that set out in part 1 of this handbook, except where otherwise noted. Inspectors will make progress judgements based on the themes explored on that visit. They will use part 2 of this handbook as the broader context for monitoring visits.</p>

<h3>Monitoring visits to providers that are newly directly publicly funded</h3>

<p>58.	We will normally carry out a monitoring visit to any provider that becomes newly directly and publicly funded, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#new-providers">paragraph 30</a>. This visit will normally be carried out within 24 months of starting to deliver the directly funded provision. New providers starting to deliver provision from April 2021 onwards will normally receive their new provider monitoring visit within 18 months of starting to deliver. These monitoring visits will follow themes. In each case, inspectors will review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>progress in leadership and management in the first theme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>progress in providing a high-quality of education or training in the second theme</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>progress towards ensuring effective safeguarding arrangements in the third theme</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>59.	The precise wording of the themes for the most commonly recurring types of new provider are as follows.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Type of new provider</th>
      <th scope="col">Leadership and management theme</th>
      <th scope="col">Quality of education and/or training theme</th>
      <th scope="col">Safeguarding theme</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Providers newly directly funded to deliver apprenticeship training provision from or after April 2017 and new providers of level 6 or 7 apprenticeship provision<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup>
</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders made in ensuring that the provider is meeting all the requirements of successful apprenticeship provision?</td>
      <td>What progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that apprentices benefit from high-quality training that leads to positive outcomes for apprentices?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that effective safeguarding arrangements are in place?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Providers newly directly funded to deliver adult learning provision from or after August 2017<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">[footnote 28]</a></sup>
</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in designing and delivering relevant adult learning provision that has a clearly defined purpose?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made to ensure that learners benefit from high-quality adult education that prepares them well for their intended job role, career aim and/or personal goals?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that effective safeguarding arrangements are in place?</td>
    </tr>

      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that learners benefit from high-quality learning programmes that develop their independence, communication and skills, and help them to achieve their personal and/or work-related goals?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that effective safeguarding arrangements are in place?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>New 16 to 19 academies directly funded from August 2019 onwards and new providers that deliver only 16 to 18 provision</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in designing and delivering relevant education programmes that have a clearly defined purpose?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made to ensure that learners benefit from high-quality education programmes for young people that prepare them well for their intended job role, career aim and/or personal goals?</td>
      <td>How much progress have leaders and managers made in ensuring that effective safeguarding arrangements are in place?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>60.	We will adapt these themes to apply to other types of new providers as necessary to ensure best fit. They will still follow the format and approach set out above.</p>

<p>61.	For these new providers, inspectors make progress judgements by taking into account that the provider is newly directly funded and by considering the impact of actions taken to develop the necessary knowledge, skills and behaviours of learners.</p>

<p>62.	If the provider has other types of provision, each type of provision will be covered by a separate theme and progress judgement.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">[footnote 29]</a></sup></p>

<p>63.	If a provider is judged to have made insufficient progress in the safeguarding theme, it will normally receive one further monitoring visit to review only its safeguarding arrangements within 4 months of the previous monitoring visit.</p>

<h3>Monitoring visits to providers judged to require improvement</h3>

<p>64.	We will normally carry out a monitoring visit to a provider that has been judged to require improvement. The visit will normally take place between 7 and 13 months from the publication of its inspection report in which it was judged to require improvement.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">[footnote 30]</a></sup> Inspectors will make progress judgements on the main areas for improvement identified in that report. The monitoring visit will result in a published report. Through the monitoring visit, inspectors will challenge the provider to improve so that it can become good by the next full inspection.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:31" rel="footnote">[footnote 31]</a></sup> The report will set out what progress the provider has made since the previous inspection.</p>

<h3>Re-inspection monitoring visits to providers judged to be inadequate</h3>

<p>65.	We normally carry out re-inspection monitoring visits to providers found to be inadequate overall after the publication of their inspection report, except when their main funding has been terminated and/or they have been removed from the <abbr title="Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers">RoATP</abbr> and they deliver only apprenticeship provision.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:32" rel="footnote">[footnote 32]</a></sup></p>

<p>66.	Re-inspection monitoring visit themes will be based on the main areas for improvement identified in the inspection report. Inspectors will make a progress judgement against each theme as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#monitoring-visits-judgements">paragraph 56</a>. The re-inspection monitoring visit report will be published. Through the monitoring visit, inspectors will challenge the provider to improve. The report will set out what progress the provider has made since the previous inspection.</p>

<p>67.	The first re-inspection monitoring visit will normally take place within 6 months of the date of publication of the previous inspection report, if the provider continues to be funded. A second re-inspection monitoring visit will normally take place within 10 months of the date of publication of the previous inspection report, if the provider continues to be funded.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:33" rel="footnote">[footnote 33]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Interim visits and progress monitoring visits</h3>

<p>68.	We suspended routine inspection activity between 17 March 2020 and 15 March 2021. During that time, we carried out the following forms of interim inspection activity.</p>

<h4>Interim visits</h4>

<p>69.	Between September and December 2020, we carried out interim visits to a range of providers. We published the reports. These included no specific judgements or recommendations.</p>

<h4>Progress monitoring visits</h4>

<p>70.	From 25 January 2021 to 19 March 2021, we carried out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/january-2021-further-education-and-skills-providers">progress monitoring visits (<abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr>)</a> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>providers that were judged to require improvement and that had not yet received a monitoring visit since their previous full inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>providers that were judged inadequate and that had not yet received a monitoring visit since their previous full inspection or that were due their second re-inspection monitoring visit (if they continued to be publicly funded)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new providers (as per <a class="govuk-link" href="#new-providers">paragraphs 30 and 31</a>) that were due a full inspection and that had received a new provider monitoring visit 2 years ago or more (subject to a provider’s individual circumstances)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other providers as necessary</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>71.	These <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> were a type of monitoring visit so we published their reports and these included a single progress judgement against the following overall theme:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What progress are leaders and those responsible for governance making to ensure that staff teach a curriculum and provide support to meet learners’ needs, including the provision of remote/online learning?</li>
</ul>

<p>72.	We carried out <abbr title="progress monitoring visits">PMVs</abbr> under the national lockdown in force at that time. Therefore, we did them remotely. This limited our ability to provide the same level of assurance that on-site activity would provide.</p>

<p>73.	Following the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, a provider that requires improvement would receive a requires improvement monitoring visit (<abbr title="requires improvement monitoring visit">RIMV</abbr>), following normal arrangements. However, these providers may have chosen to forgo their <abbr title="requires improvement monitoring visit">RIMV</abbr> and go straight to a full re-inspection as their next inspection activity.</p>

<p>74.	Following the <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, an inadequate provider would normally receive a re-inspection monitoring visit (<abbr title="re-inspection monitoring visit">RMV</abbr>), following normal arrangements. However, these providers may have chosen to forgo their <abbr title="re-inspection monitoring visit">RMV</abbr> (or both RMVs if they are due 2 visits) and go straight to the full re-inspection as their next inspection activity.</p>

<p>75.	Following a <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr>, all other providers will receive whatever inspection they would expect under normal arrangements. We will take into account the outcome of a provider’s <abbr title="progress monitoring visit">PMV</abbr> when reviewing the timing of its next full inspection.</p>

<h3>Pilots</h3>

<p>76.	From time to time, we may pilot different approaches to inspection. We will provide details for this on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2>Scope of inspection</h2>

<p>77.	We will normally inspect providers that have one or more of the following that they are directly responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>direct funding from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an advanced learner loans facility from <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adult education funding from Greater London Authority (<abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>) and/or one of the mayoral and combined authorities (<abbr title="mayoral or combined authorities">MCAs</abbr>)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:34" rel="footnote">[footnote 34]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>apprenticeship training provision funded through the apprenticeship levy<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:35" rel="footnote">[footnote 35]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>78.	Subcontracted provision that is part of the directly funded provider’s responsibility is also within the scope of inspection. As part of the inspection, inspectors may look at any provision carried out on behalf of the provider by subcontractors or partners. Typically, visits to, or communications with, subcontractors are likely to include inspecting the direct contract holder’s arrangements to quality assure and improve the provision.</p>

<p>79.	Inspections will not include provision that the provider operates under subcontracted arrangements on behalf of other providers.</p>

<p>80.	Ofsted reserves the right to inspect and grade any subcontractor and its provision as a separate entity against the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> and this handbook.</p>

<p>81.	Any provision that is part of a pilot scheme is normally outside the scope for inspection. Provision funded by the European Social Fund is normally outside the scope of inspection.</p>

<h3>Inspecting residential provision in colleges</h3>

<p>82.	We inspect residential accommodation in colleges taking into account the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-residential-accommodation-national-minimum-standards">national minimum standards for the accommodation of students aged under 18</a>. The standards apply to ‘institutions within the further education sector’, as defined by section 91 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/13/contents" rel="external">Further and Higher Education Act 1992</a>, which have residential accommodation for 16- and 17-year-olds. These inspections are separate from the inspection of the education and training provision of the college described in this handbook.</p>

<p>83.	Our social care inspectors carry out these inspections. The approach is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif-residential-provision-of-further-education-colleges">‘Social care common inspection framework (SCCIF): residential provision of further education colleges’</a>. If a college is registered as a care home, the Care Quality Commission inspects the accommodation.</p>

<h3>Inspection of religious education and collective worship in relation to Catholic sixth-form colleges</h3>

<p>84.	In the case of these colleges, the relevant Catholic diocese will inspect their denominational religious education, Catholic ethos and the content of collective worship. Our inspectors will not comment on the content of religious worship or on denominational religious education. Inspectors may visit lessons and assemblies in order to help them evaluate how these contribute to students’ personal development and behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<h2>What inspections will cover</h2>

<p>85.	On a full inspection, inspectors will make an overall effectiveness judgement and key judgements on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>86.	They will also make judgements on each major type of provision offered, as set out in the table below.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>87.	Inspectors will take account of all types of provision within the scope of the inspection. They will grade and report on the types of provision. If the number of learners in a particular type of provision is very low and/or the provision is very new and inspectors cannot gather sufficient evidence to arrive at a graded judgement, it will not be graded.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:37" rel="footnote">[footnote 37]</a></sup></p>

<p>88.	The quality of provision for learners with high needs and with special educational needs and/or disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>), a much broader group than those attracting high-needs funding, will always be considered during the inspection of any type of provision.</p>

<p>89.	Sector subject areas will not be graded or reported on separately. However, inspectors may use their subject expertise to contribute to the evidence base for types of provision judgements, key judgements and progress judgements.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:38" rel="footnote">[footnote 38]</a></sup></p>

<p>90.	The lead inspector will normally confirm to the provider which types of provision will be graded separately.</p>

<h3>Before the inspection</h3>

<p>91.	The lead inspector’s planning will focus primarily on how inspectors will gather evidence of learners’ experiences, to evaluate the different types of provision offered by the provider against the 4 key judgements of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>92.	Inspectors’ evidence-gathering will be primarily made up of focused curriculum reviews or ‘deep dives’, including lesson/session/lecture/workshop visits, scrutinising learners’ work/training and assessment, and discussions with learners and teachers/ trainers. Inspectors may carry out some inspection activities jointly with members of the provider’s staff.</p>

<p>93.	Inspectors may carry out inspection activities during planned visits to learners who are working at their employer’s premises or at subcontractor’s premises. These visits give inspectors the opportunity to hold discussions with learners and employers, to discuss learning programmes and to look at learners’ work. Inspectors may carry out interviews/discussions with learners, employers, staff, those responsible for governance, subcontractors and others via telephone, video calls or webinars.</p>

<p>94.	In the case of inspections of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions (including specialist designated institutions), inspectors’ evidence gathering will also focus on the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs and its engagement with employers and other stakeholders, and so will involve a number of meetings and discussions with those parties.</p>

<h3>The role of the nominee in inspection</h3>

<p>95.	Each provider is invited to nominate a senior member of staff to act as the provider’s main link with the inspection team. The nominee should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a detailed understanding of the provider’s programmes and operations, including, where appropriate, those of subcontractors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be sufficiently senior to ensure the cooperation of staff at all levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have authority to carry out the role with autonomy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>96.	The nominee’s responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>providing information for the lead inspector to support inspection planning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>liaising with the lead inspector and ensuring that documents and other information are available, and that staff can attend meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>briefing the provider’s staff about arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing learners and employers about the inspection<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:39" rel="footnote">[footnote 39]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing learners, employers, parents, carers and staff that they can give their views through the relevant online questionnaires (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#seeking-views">‘Seeking the views of learners, parents and carers, employers and staff’</a> below)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:40" rel="footnote">[footnote 40]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attending team meetings, in particular the final grading/ judgement team meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>coordinating feedback arrangements, in particular at the end of the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>97.	A further education college, sixth-form college or designated institution that is subject to a full enhanced inspection may also nominate a skills nominee to liaise with inspectors who will be focusing on gathering evidence relating to the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs.</p>

<h3>Notification of inspection</h3>

<p>98.	Notification of all types of further education and skills inspections and monitoring visits normally takes place up to 2 working days before the inspection, unless the inspection is unannounced. Ofsted reserves the right to carry out unannounced inspections or monitoring visits.</p>

<p>99.	We will normally notify the provider on the morning of the notification day and will email the notification letter. The lead inspector will then contact the provider, normally by phone, as soon as possible and by the following morning at the latest. The lead inspector should make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>good communications and effective working relationships are established</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the arrangements for the inspection are confirmed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Notification of enhanced college inspections</h3>

<p>100.	In the case of a full inspection of a further education college, sixth-form college or designated institution (including specialist designated institutions)<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:41" rel="footnote">[footnote 41]</a></sup> from September 2022, we will normally notify the provider of the inspection 5 or 6 working days before the inspection starts. However, this earlier notification will only be done to allow the college sufficient time to assist inspectors in assessing the college’s contribution to skills needs. We will normally notify the provider on the morning of the notification day and will email the notification letter. The lead inspector will then contact the provider, normally by phone, as soon as possible during the notification day.</p>

<p>101.	During the notification call, the inspector will request that the college set up meetings during the inspection with key employers and other stakeholders that it engages with to meet local, regional and national skills needs. The college should arrange meetings with those partners and stakeholder it believes are key in helping to realise its skills strategy. The key stakeholders may be drawn from any or all of these groups (the examples are illustrative and not exhaustive):</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Civic</td>
      <td>Local or regional government bodies. These might include: local authorities (including county, district, borough or city councils and unitary, mayoral and combined authorities), local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), regional development bodies and agencies, Jobcentre Plus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Employers</td>
      <td>Small, medium and large employers and businesses, and bodies representing employers, such as chambers of commerce, the Federation of Small Business (FSB) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), relevant employer representative bodies as designated in accordance with section 2 of the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Education providers</td>
      <td>Other providers of education including other colleges, universities/higher education institutions, independent learning providers, community learning and skills providers, schools</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Community</td>
      <td>Community representative groups, local authority projects or initiatives that train or bring into education those furthest from employment or training, or that target particular neighbourhoods, areas and communities</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>102.	The lead inspector may also ask the college to send a summary of how it contributes to meeting skills needs.</p>

<p>103.	The planning of all of the other aspects of the inspection will take place from 2 working days before the inspection starts, following notification at 5 or 6 days before. The lead inspector will make clear during the initial notification call that they will make contact with the college again 2 working days before inspection to carry out this planning. This planning will take place as set out in paragraphs 104 to 115, and as happens with all other full inspections. This second, and main, phase of planning from 2 working days before the inspection will not involve a second notification, since the notification of inspection will already have happened at 5 or 6 days before.</p>

<h2>Planning for the inspection</h2>

<p>104.	As soon as the provider has been notified of the inspection, staff should draw together the information in <a class="govuk-link" href="#logistics">paragraph 107</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:42" rel="footnote">[footnote 42]</a></sup> These should be working documents and not prepared specifically for the inspection. Inspectors should keep the review of documentation to a minimum. Providers are not expected to prepare anything extra for inspectors.</p>

<p>105.	Inspectors should be aware that the provider will need to accommodate the inspection while still managing day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>106.	A provider may request a deferral of its monitoring visit or inspection. We will decide whether this should be granted in accordance with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deferring-ofsted-inspections">deferral policy</a>. The lead inspector will liaise with the provider to ensure that, wherever possible, the inspection or monitoring visit can go ahead.</p>

<p>107.	To ensure that the lead inspector has a clear understanding of the scope and range of provision and information needed to plan the logistics of the inspection, the nominee will send the following information, as applicable, as soon as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>details of the courses/programmes being delivered and their mode of delivery, including through remote and/or online delivery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>timetables for lessons/sessions/lectures/seminars/workshops or other learning activities during the week</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of provider staff and a diagram of the organisational structure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the geographical spread of training premises and learners, particularly work-based learners and apprentices, according to regions or sub-regions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the names and location of employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the names and location of subcontractors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact information for key staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of learners in the following age groups: 14 to 16; 16 to 18; 19+<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:43" rel="footnote">[footnote 43]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current overall number of learners (excluding apprentices) at level 1 or below, level 2, level 3 and level 4/5, by subject area</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of apprentices at each level, according to age groups: 16 to 18, 19 to 24, and 25+, by subject area and by apprenticeship framework or standard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of learners following employability programmes and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of learners who are on a study programme but who are not working towards a substantial qualification</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of learners following traineeships and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of learners on community learning programmes and those who have attended in the previous 12 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current number of learners with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and the number of learners for whom high-needs funding is received, and their particular needs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>108.	To ensure that the provider understands the inspection process, the lead inspector will hold a telephone planning meeting with the nominee/most senior member of staff.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:44" rel="footnote">[footnote 44]</a></sup></p>

<p>109.	The lead inspector will use the telephone planning meeting to arrange how information is made available to inspectors. The provider should inform all subcontractors’ staff, current learners, employers and other users about the inspection. It should emphasise that inspectors may visit any sessions involving learners either on the provider’s premises or at other locations, including learners’ workplaces or online.</p>

<p>110.	During the planning call with the inspection nominee, the lead inspector will seek to understand the specific impact of COVID-19 on the provider and learners and how leaders and managers are responding to the ongoing impact. We recognise that responding to COVID-19 has placed demands on leaders and detailed discussions of the COVID-19 pandemic may be required to understand the provider’s context. This discussion will also explore how the provider implemented the curriculum remotely and what, if any, elements of remote education remain in place at the time of inspection. Where there are learners or staff who are particularly at risk from COVID-19, the lead inspector will agree safety protocols with the provider. Inspectors will always follow the latest guidance on testing .</p>

<p>111.	It may be pragmatic to do some elements of the inspection through video/telephone calls. This will be agreed with the provider at the start of the inspection. We will usually only use video/telephone calls to involve those with leadership responsibility or parents/carers who are unable to attend the provider’s premises.</p>

<p>112.	The lead inspector will discuss with the provider the inspectors’ schedule, the activities that inspectors will carry out face to face and the activities they plan to carry out remotely, such as through telephone or video calls. For enhanced full inspections of colleges, this will include the deployment of the inspectors evaluating the skills aspects of the inspection and the skills lead inspector will usually be involved in planning those activities.</p>

<p>113.	The lead inspector will draw up a pre-inspection team briefing for the inspection team and the nominee. The purpose of this briefing is to focus inspection activity and identify areas for exploration, in particular the areas of the curriculum that will be reviewed through ‘deep dives’ (focused curriculum reviews).</p>

<p>114.	Inspectors will select the ‘deep dive’ curriculum review areas they will focus on (and associated inspection activities, such as which learners and employers are being visited). They will take into account a range of factors, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the types of provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the courses on offer, their subjects and levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the relative performance on different courses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the number, spread and coverage of sites</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the value of the provider’s contract(s) with funding agencies or with employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the geographical spread of learners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the geographical spread of employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the mode of delivery and attendance, including remote and/or online delivery/attendance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from the provider’s nominee, learners and employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from commissioning or funding bodies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>115.	The team briefing letter will provide details about the start of the on-site inspection, including the location and timing of the initial meeting and any other relevant arrangements for the first day, including the planned deep dives.</p>

<h3>Seeking the views of learners, parents and carers, employers, staff and other stakeholders</h3>

<p>116.	Learners’ views are important to inspection. It is important that all learners can express their views to inspectors. This also applies to employers and any other key stakeholders. Inspectors will consider the views of learners, parents and carers, provider staff and employers as important evidence.</p>

<p>117.	Ofsted’s online questionnaires for learners and employers (called Learner View and Employer View) are available to gather the views of learners and employers at the point of inspection. There are also online questionnaires for parents and carers of learners and for provider staff available at the point of inspection. After notifying the provider of the inspection, we ask the nominee to tell all staff, learners, employers and (where appropriate) parents and carers of learners that the inspection is taking place. The nominee should ask them to give their views to the inspection team by using these online questionnaires.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:45" rel="footnote">[footnote 45]</a></sup></p>

<p>118.	Surveys of the views of learners, employers, parents/carers and staff carried out by the provider, funding bodies or other organisations provide evidence for the inspection and may indicate themes to explore further. They do not replace talking with learners, employers and staff during the inspection or views collected through our online questionnaires.</p>

<p>119.	Inspectors will speak to a range of learners and employers, often as part of the ‘deep dive’ focused curriculum reviews. This may happen face to face or remotely, for instance through a webinar or online meeting. We may use other surveys to capture views.</p>

<p>120.	Inspectors will take account of views expressed to them by learners, employers, parents, governors, staff and the nominee. Where necessary, these meetings must take place without the presence of the nominee or senior staff.  Meetings during the inspection may include those with samples of learners selected by inspectors and open-invitation meetings. As part of the inspection of safeguarding arrangements, inspectors will meet with learners. This will normally involve meeting with specific groups of learners, in particular single-sex groups, where the provider is a college with children and young people.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:46" rel="footnote">[footnote 46]</a></sup></p>

<p>121.	The lead inspector will take account of any external views on the provider’s performance, for example through briefings from commissioning and funding bodies or other relevant regulators or inspectorates.</p>

<p>122.	For enhanced full inspections of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions, there will also be a questionnaire seeking the views of stakeholders regarding the college’s engagement with them. Links to this and the other questionnaires will be provided for the college in the notification letter. The letter will ask that the college sends the questionnaire links to the appropriate interest groups immediately so they can provide their views.</p>

<h2>During the inspection</h2>

<h3>Days allocated to inspection and inspection team members</h3>

<p>123.	Inspections and monitoring visits will be led by either one of Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) or an Ofsted Inspector (OI) assisted by other HMIs and/or <abbr title="Ofsted Inspectors">OIs</abbr>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:47" rel="footnote">[footnote 47]</a></sup></p>

<p>124.	A full inspection normally lasts between 2 and 5 days on site. The number of inspectors involved will vary according to the size and complexity of the provider. Some inspectors may only be needed for part of the inspection. How the lead inspector will deploy the team depends on the number of learners and sites, the type(s) of provision and the range of learning programmes. For enhanced full inspections of colleges, there will be one, or more than one, inspector who will focus on gathering evidence relating to the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs, including meeting with stakeholders.</p>

<p>125.	Short inspections (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#short-inspections-175">paragraphs 175 to 206</a>) normally last no longer than 2 days on site. The number of inspectors involved will vary according to the size and complexity of the provider. Some inspectors may only be needed for part of the inspection.</p>

<p>126.	Monitoring visits usually last between 1 and 2 days, depending on the scope of the visit and size of the provider. They will usually involve one or two inspectors (but may sometimes involve more).</p>

<h3>Gathering and recording evidence</h3>

<p>127.	Inspections will normally begin with in-depth discussions with provider leaders and managers about the provider’s curriculum to establish the intent of the curriculum. Inspectors will ask about what leaders intend learners to learn; what are the end points and next steps they wish them to reach through this; what are the key concepts that they need to understand; and in what order they will learn them.</p>

<p>128.	Although meetings with leaders are important, inspectors’ first priority during inspections is to collect first-hand evidence.</p>

<p>129.	Inspectors will primarily do this through a range of inspection activities, grouped into focused curriculum reviews, known as ‘deep dives’. These will provide evidence of the effective implementation of the curriculum and its intent – but they will also gather evidence which may be relevant to the other key judgement areas and progress judgements. These activities will be focused on curriculum areas selected by the lead inspector (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#deep-dive">paragraph 114</a>).</p>

<p>130.	These inspection activities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>direct observation of teaching, training and assessment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meetings and discussions with teachers, trainers and other staff (in particular subject specialists and subject leaders to understand the intent and implementation of the curriculum)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meetings and discussions with skills stakeholders and their staff (see paragraph 101   above)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interviews and discussions with learners (these may happen in formal planned meetings or in more informal settings)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scrutinising learners’ work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating learning materials, including resources for online and/or remote learning, and learners’ use of them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysing provider and learner records, showing planning for, and monitoring of, learners’ individual progress and destinations from their starting points when they began their courses or apprenticeships</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assessing learners’ progress</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>examining what learners know, understand, and can do and make as a result of their learning</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>131.	Evidence drawn from these different activities and focused on specific curriculum areas should provide valid, reliable and sufficient evidence of the quality of education and training when connected, combined and brought together.</p>

<p>132.	Evidence from these curriculum-related activities will also inform the other key judgements: behaviour and attitudes; personal development; and leadership and management.</p>

<p>133.	Inspectors will also carry out other inspection activities to gather evidence for the key judgements. These may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>analysing documents relating to leadership and management (such as notes of governors’ meetings), or personal development and behaviour and attitudes (such as records about attendance or enrichment activities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysing learner, employer, parent/carer and staff views provided through questionnaires and other sources</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meeting with learners, employers, staff, governors, board members, councillors, trustees, subcontractors and stakeholders, where appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>134.	These will include reviewing records about safeguarding, including those relating to sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse.</p>

<p>135.	During the inspection, inspectors will collect, analyse and record evidence and their judgements on paper or electronic evidence forms. It is essential that the evidence accurately reflects discussions. Inspectors should identify clearly information that was provided in confidence. The evidence forms, together with any briefings, plans or instructions prepared by the lead inspector, and responses from learners and employers (in hard copy, online or other formats) contribute to the evidence base. The lead inspector is responsible for assuring the quality of evidence.</p>

<p>136.	Ofsted has no preferred teaching style. Inspectors judge the quality of education by the ways in which learners acquire knowledge, develop skills and exhibit appropriate behaviours for work and success in life or study. Teaching staff should plan their lessons/sessions as usual.</p>

<p>137.	Inspectors may visit employers, to observe learners’ on-the-job skills development and speak to employers and their staff.</p>

<p>138.	Inspectors will not normally indicate which sessions they plan to observe. The team reserves the right to visit any learner or employer and may cancel or add visits to ensure that enough evidence is collected. Inspectors will not normally give feedback to individual members of staff following these sessions.</p>

<h3>Observations of teaching and training</h3>

<p>139.	An important element of the inspection approach will be to visit lessons, workshops or sessions where teaching, training, learning and assessment are happening. This may include visits to online lessons. Inspectors may often invite appropriate staff from the provider to take part in joint observations of these learning sessions.</p>

<p>140.	Observation is primarily useful for gathering evidence about curriculum implementation and how teaching and training sessions contribute to the quality of education and training. Inspectors can use observations to gather evidence about how well staff implement the curriculum by looking at the teaching of one subject or more, and by triangulating observations with evidence collected through discussions with staff, learners, and, where relevant, employers, and through work scrutiny.</p>

<p>141.	Inspectors will connect observation activity to other evidence for triangulation and as part of the deep dives. Observation is not about evaluating individual teachers or trainers. Inspectors will not grade the teaching or training they observe. Instead, inspectors will view teaching and training across a sample of the provision to provide part of the evidence base to inform inspection judgements, in particular the quality of education and training.</p>

<p>142.	Observation is also useful for gathering evidence that contributes to other key judgements, including behaviour and attitudes. Observation enables inspectors to see direct evidence about how behaviour is managed and how behaviours and attitudes are developed in individual learning sessions. This evidence will complement the other evidence that inspectors gather about behaviour and attitudes during inspection.</p>

<h3>Work scrutiny</h3>

<p>143.	Inspectors may scrutinise learners’ work across the provider and aggregate insights to provide part of the evidence for an overall view of quality of education, primarily around the impact of the education provided. Inspectors will not evaluate individual pieces of work. Inspectors will connect work scrutiny to lesson observation and, where possible, conversations with learners, staff and, where appropriate, with employers.</p>

<p>144.	Inspectors may invite appropriate staff from the provider to take part in joint scrutiny of learners’ work.</p>

<p>145.	Work scrutiny is useful primarily for gathering evidence about the curriculum impact of the quality of education. Inspectors can use work scrutiny to evaluate learners’ progress and progression through their course of study. Work scrutiny will show whether learners know more and can do more, and whether the knowledge and skills they have learned are well sequenced and have developed incrementally. Inspectors will synthesise what they find in order to contribute to their overall assessment of the quality of education across the provider.</p>

<h3>The use of data</h3>

<p>146.	Inspection uses a range of data that is available. Both before and during the inspection, inspectors will analyse the performance of the provider using the most recent validated data. They will take into account the age and relevance of the data. Analysis may be at overall provider level and/or for individual subjects or types of provision. Although data alone will not lead directly to judgements, the primary data that measures success for each type of provision will provide important evidence for judging the impact of the quality of education.</p>

<p>147.	Inspectors will evaluate learners’ progress in relation to their starting points, based on their rate of learning, acquisition of knowledge, skills and behaviours and whether they have achieved their individual, challenging targets. They will also take account of data about the destinations learners go to when they leave the provider.</p>

<p>148.	Inspectors will not look at internal progress and attainment data on GCSE and A-level courses where fixed-time terminal examinations comprise the entire assessment of the course. Similarly, inspectors will not normally look at predicted in-year achievement and attainment data more generally (teacher assessed grades from 2020 and 2021 will not normally be used to assess impact). That does not mean providers cannot use this data if they consider it appropriate. Inspectors will, however, put more focus on the curriculum and less on providers’ generation, analysis and interpretation of performance data. Inspectors will be interested in the conclusions drawn and actions taken from any internal assessment information but they will not examine or verify that information first hand.</p>

<h3>The self-assessment report</h3>

<p>149.	Inspectors will use self-assessment reports, or equivalent documents, to assess risk, monitor standards and plan for inspection.</p>

<p>150.	If these documents are not available in advance, the provider should share the latest report/plan(s) with the lead inspector following notification of the inspection.</p>

<p>151.	Inspectors will, in any case, use other readily available information about the provider.</p>

<p>152.	Ofsted does not require self-assessment to be provided in a specific format. Any assessment that is provided should be part of the provider’s processes and not generated solely for inspection purposes.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:48" rel="footnote">[footnote 48]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Meetings during inspection</h3>

<p>153.	Inspectors are likely to have a number of different meetings with provider staff for different purposes. They will try to minimise disruption to the provider’s regular business and to the inspection team’s focus on assessing the quality of education and training. Therefore, meetings will be kept brief and purposeful.</p>

<p>154.	Inspections will normally begin with in-depth discussion with senior leaders and managers about the provider’s curriculum to establish the intent of the curriculum. This initial meeting will also provide useful insights into leadership and management and other areas. There may be other meetings with senior leaders, including the nominee as necessary, as the inspection progresses. On a full enhanced inspection of a college, inspectors will meet with leaders and managers to discuss the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs. They may also meet with governors for that purpose.</p>

<p>155.	Inspectors carrying out deep dives focusing on specific areas of the curriculum will normally meet with key curriculum staff. This is to understand its intent and implementation before carrying out their inspection activities to review that area of the curriculum. Other types of meeting have been referred to above in <a class="govuk-link" href="#gathering-evidence">paragraphs 127 and 130</a>.</p>

<p>156.	The inspection team itself will hold meetings. They may include the whole team or 2 or more inspectors. They may be held remotely, by telephone or video call, or face to face. These meetings may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an initial team meeting to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>brief the inspection team on the schedule for the inspection</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>clarify any queries about team members’ roles</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>receive a brief update from the provider, including, if appropriate, an initial briefing from the provider’s managers with relevant responsibilities for key areas to be covered of the inspection<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:49" rel="footnote">[footnote 49]</a></sup></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a meeting for the nominee to hear the emerging judgements and identify any opportunities to provide additional evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a grading/progress judgement meeting to reach judgements about the provider</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>157.	The nominee may attend some inspection team meetings, although they may not contribute to decisions about inspection judgements. By taking part in discussions about evidence collected during the inspection, the nominee can help to ensure that all appropriate evidence is taken into account. Any concerns about evidence should be raised with the lead inspector. The nominee will report to the provider’s staff on the progress of the inspection.</p>

<p>158.	Inspectors may hold additional meetings with the provider’s staff.</p>

<p>159.	The lead inspector will hold a feedback meeting for the provider and invitees to hear the key messages at the end of the inspection. Members of staff from relevant funding and regulatory bodies may attend to hear the feedback.</p>

<h3>Reaching final judgements</h3>

<p>160.	Inspectors will discuss emerging findings with the nominee and, where appropriate, with senior staff.</p>

<p>161.	The lead inspector will ensure that the inspection team agrees the judgements for full inspections using the descriptors in part 2 of this handbook.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup> The overall judgements will reflect all of the evidence considered by the inspection team. The evidence base must support the judgements convincingly.</p>

<h3>Providing feedback</h3>

<p>162.	Before leaving, the lead inspector should ensure that the provider is clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>about the grades awarded for each judgement required <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the grades awarded are provisional and, although unlikely, may be subject to change through moderation and quality assurance<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:50" rel="footnote">[footnote 50]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the points provided in the feedback, subject to any change, will be generally reflected in the report, although the text of the report may differ slightly from the oral feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the main findings and areas for improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that inspection findings may be shared with the Further Education Commissioner, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, Ofqual, Office for Students (<abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr>) or other relevant regulator/inspectorate before the publication of the report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the procedures that will lead to the publication of the report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the complaints procedure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where relevant, about the implications of the provider being judged as requires improvement or inadequate overall<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:51" rel="footnote">[footnote 51]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that, if the overall effectiveness or the leadership and management of a sixth-form college, further education college or designated institution are judged inadequate, this has implications for the college in relation to appointing <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-newly-qualified-teachers-nqts">newly qualified staff</a> in future years</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>After the inspection</h2>

<h3>Arrangements for publishing the report</h3>

<p>163.	The lead inspector is responsible for writing the inspection report and submitting the evidence to Ofsted shortly after the inspection ends. The text of the report should reflect the evidence. The findings in the report should be consistent with the feedback given to the provider at the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>164.	Inspection reports will be quality assured before we send a draft copy to the provider. The provider will receive the draft report within 18 working days after the end of the inspection. The draft report is restricted and confidential to the relevant personnel (as determined by the provider), including those responsible for governance, and should not be shared externally or published. The inspection process is not complete until the provider receives the final version of the report. We may share the draft findings and/or provisional judgements of the inspection/monitoring visit with the Further Education Commissioner, <abbr title="Education and Skills Funding Agency">ESFA</abbr>, <abbr title="mayoral or combined authorities">MCAs</abbr> or the <abbr title="Greater London Authority">GLA</abbr>, <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, Ofqual, <abbr title="Office for Students">OfS</abbr> or other relevant regulator/inspectorate as necessary (that might entail sharing the draft report in whole or in part).</p>

<p>165.	The provider will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report, inspection process and findings. We will consider all comments. We will respond to them when we share the final report with the provider within 30 working days after the inspection.</p>

<p>166.	If the provider wishes to make a formal complaint, it has 5 working days after we have shared the final report with it in which to do so. If a complaint is not submitted, we will normally publish the report on our reports website 3 working days later. If a complaint has been submitted, the publication of the report may be delayed.</p>

<p>167.	A provider judged to be outstanding or good can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://logos.ofsted.gov.uk/using-and-downloading" rel="external">use specific Ofsted logos</a> to promote its judgement, for example on its website. Providers may only use a logo when it reflects the judgement of the most recent full inspection of that provider. They must remove the logo when the provider’s URN changes, or if their overall effectiveness grade changes. More information can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-ofsted-logos-and-copyright">our logo terms of use page</a></p>

<h3>The inspection evidence base</h3>

<p>168.	The evidence base for the inspection must be retained for the time specified in our guidance.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:52" rel="footnote">[footnote 52]</a></sup> This is normally 6 years from the publication of the report. We may decide that retaining it for longer is warranted for research purposes.</p>

<h3>Incomplete inspections</h3>

<p>169.	We will apply our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gathering-additional-evidence-to-secure-an-incomplete-inspection">policy on incomplete inspections</a> where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Quality assurance and complaints</h2>

<h3>Quality assurance of inspection</h3>

<p>170.	All inspectors are responsible for the quality of their work. The lead inspector must ensure that inspections are carried out in accordance with the principles of inspection and the code of conduct (set out in the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>).</p>

<p>171.	We monitor the quality of inspections through a range of formal processes. Senior HMI or HMI may visit some providers or monitor remotely to quality assure inspections. We may also evaluate the quality of an inspection evidence base. The lead inspector will be responsible for feeding back to the team inspectors about the quality of their work and their conduct.</p>

<p>172.	All providers are invited to take part in a voluntary post-inspection survey in order to contribute to inspection development. The link to this survey is included with the final inspection report to the provider.</p>

<h3>Handling concerns and complaints</h3>

<p>173.	The great majority of Ofsted’s work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns do arise during an inspection visit, they should be raised with the lead inspector as soon as possible in order to resolve issues before the inspection is completed. The lead inspector should seek advice where necessary. Inspectors should note any concerns raised, and actions taken, in the inspection evidence.</p>

<p>174.	If it is not possible to resolve concerns during the inspection, or through submitting comments in response to the draft report, the provider may wish to lodge a formal complaint. The lead inspector should ensure that the provider is informed of the procedures for making a formal complaint and that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">information about how to complain</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>Short inspections</h2>

<p>175.	If a provider is graded good for overall effectiveness at its previous inspection and falls within the categories set out in paragraph 25, it will usually receive a short inspection     by September 2025 (unless they have had an inspection since April 2021) (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#providers-good">paragraph 25</a>). However, they may receive a full inspection if information suggests that this is the most appropriate way forward. Providers graded outstanding for overall effectiveness at their previous inspection that took place on or after 1 September 2015 and that do not fall in the categories set out in paragraphs 17 and 18 will usually receive a short inspection by September 2025 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#outstanding-full-inspection">paragraphs 16 to 19</a>).</p>

<p>176.	A short inspection will determine primarily whether the quality of education/training that learners receive is good (for good providers) or outstanding (for outstanding providers). Inspectors will consider the provider’s quality of education and/or training and the effectiveness of leadership and management. They will assess whether safeguarding arrangements are effective and if learners benefit from good-quality careers advice and guidance. Short inspections may also cover any areas particular to a provider that the lead inspector judges necessary.</p>

<p>177.	In order to confirm whether the provider remains good/outstanding (as applicable), inspectors will use the criteria set out in part 2 of this handbook. They will not be expected to carry out a full inspection within a reduced timeframe but to arrive at sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the provider remains good/outstanding (as applicable) overall.</p>

<p>178.	A short inspection report will not give graded judgements for provision types. It will not change the provider’s overall effectiveness grade.</p>

<p>179.	Ofsted reserves the right to carry out a full inspection to any provider at any reasonable time.</p>

<p>180.	As with all other inspections under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>, the model of short inspections is designed to encourage constructive, challenging professional conversation between inspectors, leaders, managers and governors.</p>

<h3>The purpose of a short inspection</h3>

<p>181.	The main purpose of short inspections is to evaluate sufficiently whether the provider remains good (if currently a good provider) or, outstanding (if currently an outstanding provider) and in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the provider’s quality of education/training remains good or outstanding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether safeguarding arrangements are effective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether careers education and guidance are of a good quality<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:53" rel="footnote">[footnote 53]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders, managers and governors have the capacity to make continued improvement and manage change well</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>182.	A short inspection will also take into account: any other aspect that the lead inspector considers particularly relevant given the findings of the previous inspection report; issues identified at the planning stage; and the particular nature of the provider.</p>

<p>183.	Inspectors will focus primarily on the quality of education during a short inspection. They will not expect to cover the criteria within the quality of education judgement in part 2 of this handbook to the same extent as on a full inspection. They will focus on a number of key curriculum areas using deep-dive focused curriculum reviews to provide sufficient evidence that the provider remains good. This will follow the same approach as set out in the sections above: <a class="govuk-link" href="#gathering-evidence">‘gathering and recording evidence’</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#observations">‘observations of teaching and training’</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="#work-scrutiny">‘work scrutiny’</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#data">‘use of data’</a>.</p>

<p>184.	A short inspection will be carried out by one or more inspectors over 1 or 2 days, depending on the size and type of provider.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:54" rel="footnote">[footnote 54]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Outcomes of a short inspection</h3>

<p>185.	A short inspection has 3 possible outcomes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 1 – the provider continues to be good/outstanding (as applicable). In these cases, it will receive a short inspection report following the report publication process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 2 – a currently good provider continues to be at least good and there is sufficient evidence of improvement to suggest that it may be judged outstanding. In these cases, the short inspection will be extended to a full inspection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 3 – the inspection team has insufficient evidence to satisfy itself that the provider remains good/outstanding (as applicable), or there are concerns arising from evidence gathered that the provider may not remain good/outstanding (as applicable). In these cases, the short inspection will be extended to a full inspection. This will usually be completed within 15 working days of the short inspection (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#extending-inspection">paragraph 190</a> below).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>186.	Inspectors will always report on whether safeguarding is effective. If safeguarding is not effective, inspectors will extend the short inspection to a full inspection.</p>

<h4>Providers that remain good/outstanding (as applicable) (outcome 1)</h4>

<p>187.	If inspectors judge that a provider remains good/outstanding (as applicable) (outcome 1), they will confirm this judgement in the final feedback at the end of the short inspection.</p>

<h4>Extending short inspections to full inspections (outcomes 2 and 3)</h4>

<p>188.	The short inspection will be extended to a full inspection if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the provider is currently good and there is sufficient evidence of improvement to suggest that it may be judged outstanding (outcome 2); the lead inspector has insufficient evidence to confirm that it remains good (outcome 3); or the provider is currently good and there is evidence that the provider may no longer be good (which may include concerns about safeguarding) (outcome 3)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provider is currently outstanding and the lead inspector has insufficient evidence to confirm that the provider remains outstanding; or there is evidence that it may no longer be outstanding (which may include concerns about safeguarding) (outcome 3)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>189.	In the cases of outcomes 2 or 3, the lead inspector will inform the provider by the end of the short inspection of the decision to extend the inspection to a full inspection.</p>

<p>190.	For outcomes 2 and 3, the short inspection will be extended to a full inspection as soon as possible. This will usually be completed within 15 working days of the short inspection. More inspectors may join the lead inspector on site. This may include HMI and/or <abbr title="Ofsted Inspectors">OIs</abbr>. The inspection team will gather and evaluate evidence to make a full set of graded judgements against the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>. The lead inspector from the short inspection will usually continue the full inspection.</p>

<p>191.	A decision to extend the inspection does not predetermine the outcome of the full inspection. At the end of the full inspection, the provider may receive any grade on the 4-point grading scale.</p>

<p>192.	The lead inspector of the full inspection will contact the nominee and tell them when the full inspection will start. The lead inspector will share the team composition and deployment. The inspector may request further evidence and information for planning before the on-site stage of the inspection begins.</p>

<p>193.	Between the end of the short inspection and the beginning of the full inspection following extension, evidence from the short inspection will be shared with the new team. The lead inspector and that team will build on the evidence to complete the full inspection, avoiding repetition or duplication.</p>

<p>194.	The full inspection may move straight to evidence gathering, without an initial team meeting.</p>

<p>195.	A short inspection report will not be produced when the short inspection extends to a full inspection. Instead, the provider will receive a full inspection report.</p>

<h4>Inspectors’ planning and preparation</h4>

<p>196.	The lead inspector will share with the inspection team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>essential information about the provider and the timings for the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a short summary of any areas to be focused on, based on a brief analysis of the pre-inspection information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a brief outline of inspection activity, including planned ‘deep dive’ focused curriculum reviews; this will be finalised on site</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Notification and introduction</h4>

<p>197.	We will normally notify the provider up to 2 working days before the inspection, unless the inspection is unannounced. Ofsted reserves the right to carry out unannounced inspections or visits. We will notify the provider in the morning of the notification day and will email the notification letter. The lead inspector will then contact the provider as soon as possible.</p>

<p>198.	Leaders, managers and governors are not required to prepare documents or other materials for inspection. Inspectors will review documents and other materials that leaders, staff and governors use for normal day-to-day business. Any assessment should be part of the provider’s usual evaluation work and not generated solely for inspection purposes. Inspectors will use what the provider has.</p>

<p>199.	During the initial telephone call to a provider selected for short inspection, the lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>establish contact with the provider’s nominee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the date of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>explain the purpose of the inspection, including the different possible outcomes of the short inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>indicate the likely format and timings of the short inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>request that the provider alerts learners, employers, parents and carers (where appropriate) and provider staff about the inspection. These groups will be invited to give their views by means of online questionnaires</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make initial arrangements for meeting or interviewing governors, managers, staff, learners, employers and others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make arrangements to visit employers or subcontractors as necessary</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>200.	Inspectors may also request further information during the initial telephone call, by subsequent email or at the first opportunity on site. This information may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>information about learners, their types of provision, courses/programmes, subject areas and locations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>timetables for lessons/sessions/workshops or other learning activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of provider staff and/or a diagram of the organisational structure and key staff contact information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the current self-assessment report or equivalent and any evaluation of the impact of actions taken to date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>recent data on learners’ outcomes, performance, progress and destinations (but note <a class="govuk-link" href="#data">paragraph 148</a> above about internal progress and attainment data on GCSE and A-level courses where fixed-time terminal examinations comprise the entire assessment of the course)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lists of employers and subcontractors and their locations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>201.	Requests for a deferral will be handled in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/deferring-ofsted-inspections">Ofsted’s deferral policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Feedback at the end of a short inspection</h4>

<p>202.	The lead inspector will give oral feedback at the end of the short inspection. The lead inspector is responsible for managing this meeting and agreeing attendance with the nominee.</p>

<p>203.	The lead inspector will state one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that the provider continues to be good/outstanding (depending on its current grade)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there is evidence that the provider may no longer be good/outstanding or that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the provider is still good/outstanding (as applicable); if either is the case, they will explain that the inspection will be extended into a full inspection and the process for this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that there is sufficient evidence of improved quality in the case of a currently good provider to extend the inspection to a full inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>204.	The lead inspector will also make clear whether the provider’s safeguarding arrangements are judged to be effective and provide feedback on other relevant areas covered in the short inspection (as outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#purpose-of-a-short-inspection">paragraph 181</a>).</p>

<h4>Reporting on the short inspection</h4>

<p>205.	If the quality of provision remains good/outstanding (as applicable), the provider will receive a short inspection report setting out the inspection findings. These will include statements that the provider remains good/outstanding, a judgement on whether safeguarding arrangements are effective, and a summary of what the provider does well and what it can do better. If the short inspection is extended to become a full inspection, the provider will receive a full inspection report as outlined above and not a short inspection report.</p>

<h4>Quality assurance and publication of the short inspection report</h4>

<p>206.	The short inspection report will be published on our website. Quality assurance and publication processes are the same as those for full inspection reports (<a class="govuk-link" href="#publishing-the-report">see paragraphs 163 to 174</a>).</p>

<h2>Part 2. The evaluation schedule: how further education and skills providers will be judged</h2>

<h3>Background to the evaluation schedule</h3>

<p>207.	Inspectors must use the evaluation schedule alongside the guidance set out in part 1 of this handbook and the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>208.	The evaluation schedule is not exhaustive. It does not replace the professional judgement of inspectors. Inspectors must interpret grade descriptors in relation to the type(s) of provision inspected and context of the provider.</p>

<p>209.	In line with the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>, inspectors will make judgements on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overall effectiveness</li>
</ul>

<p>and the 4 key judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>210.	We have created the criteria for each of these judgements using inspection experience, areas of consensus in academic research and our own research. You can find a full note of how the judgement criteria relate to the available research in our commentary (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework-overview-of-research">‘Education inspection framework: overview of research’</a>).</p>

<p>211.	Inspectors use the following 4-point scale to make all judgements, including, where applicable, on the effectiveness of the different types of provision offered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grade 1: outstanding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 2: good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 3: requires improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 4: inadequate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The evaluation schedule and grade descriptors</h2>

<h3>Overall effectiveness</h3>

<p>212.	Inspectors must use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a learner at the provider. In making their judgements about a provider’s overall effectiveness, inspectors will consider whether the quality of provision is good or whether it exceeds good and is therefore outstanding. If it is not good, inspectors will consider whether it requires improvement or is inadequate. A provider will be inadequate under a particular judgement if one or more of the inadequate criteria apply, unless the inadequate criteria apply solely due to the impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>213.	In judging the overall effectiveness, inspectors will take account of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the overall effectiveness judgement for each type of provision inspected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the 4 key judgements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>214.	Inspectors will first judge the overall effectiveness of each type of provision inspected. To do this, they will apply the grading criteria set out in the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>. The section <a class="govuk-link" href="#evaluating-provision-types">‘Evaluating types of provision’</a> in this handbook sets out how inspectors will evaluate the overall effectiveness of each type of provision. The inspection report will include a numerical grade for each type of provision inspected. Inspectors will then grade the 4 key judgements. Where there are differences in grades given for a type of provision, inspectors will consider the following when awarding the grade for overall effectiveness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of learners in/the funding value of the relevant provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the impact of the weaker areas on learners’ overall experience and quality of education received</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>215.	Inspectors will always make a written sub-judgement about the effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding learners as part of the leadership and management key judgement. In the case of further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions, inspectors will also make a written sub-judgement on the college’s contribution to skills needs. This will be linked with the quality of education and leadership and management key judgements.</p>

<p>216.	Before making the final judgement on overall effectiveness, inspectors must evaluate the extent to which the education and training provided meets the needs of all learners. This includes learners with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and those who have high needs.</p>

<h2>Grade descriptors for overall effectiveness</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of education is outstanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All types of provision offered are likely to be outstanding. In exceptional circumstances, a type of provision may be good, as long as there is convincing evidence that the provider is improving this provision rapidly and securely towards it being outstanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All key judgements are likely to be outstanding. In exceptional circumstances, one of the key judgements may be good, as long as there is convincing evidence that the provider is improving this area rapidly and securely towards it being outstanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding is effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>217.	To judge whether a provider is good, requires improvement or is inadequate, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the professional judgement of the inspection team.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of education is at least good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All types of provision offered are likely to be good or outstanding. In exceptional circumstances, a type of provision may require improvement, if there is convincing evidence that the provider is improving this provision rapidly and securely towards it being good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All key judgements are likely to be good or outstanding. In exceptional circumstances, one of the key judgement areas may require improvement, as long as there is convincing evidence that the provider is improving it rapidly and securely towards it being good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding is effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Requires improvement (3)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Other than in exceptional circumstances, it is likely that, where the provider requires improvement in any of the key judgements, the provider’s overall effectiveness will require improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding is effective, or, if there are any weaknesses in safeguarding, they are not difficult to rectify, and there are no serious failings that leave learners being harmed or at risk of harm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The judgement on the overall effectiveness is likely to be inadequate when any one of the key judgements is inadequate and/or safeguarding is ineffective.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Evaluating types of provision</h2>

<p>218.	The following section outlines what inspectors will look for to demonstrate how the grade descriptors for each key judgement apply to each type of provision.</p>

<h3>Education programmes for young people</h3>

<p>219.	To achieve comparability with the way in which we inspect and judge 16 to 19 provision in schools and academies under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>, the considerations below align with those in the school inspection handbook.</p>

<p>220.	Inspectors will review provision for learners aged 14 to 16 enrolled full time at a college and provision for learners on traineeships aged 16 to 19 as part of this judgement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will consider how well leaders and teachers promote high expectations for achievement and progress through the systems they use to monitor and develop the quality of provision for learners, including the most disadvantaged, those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and those with high needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will consider how leaders and teachers develop or take on a purposeful curriculum that provides progression and stretch, as well as mathematics and English for all learners, including those without GCSE legacy grades A* to C (reformed grades 9 to 4) and, where relevant, work experience or industry placements and non-qualification activities.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:55" rel="footnote">[footnote 55]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will review how well high-quality impartial careers guidance enables learners to make progress and move on to a higher level of qualification, employment, further training or independent living when they are ready to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will use observations of teaching and training activities, and discussions with learners, teachers, support staff and, where relevant, employers, to consider how well learners develop personal, social and independent learning skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how well learners achieve high levels of punctuality and attendance and how well learners’ conduct and attitudes, including in non-qualification or enrichment activities and/or work experience, prepare them for employment or to progress to higher levels of study and/or independence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will also consider whether arrangements for safeguarding learners are appropriate and effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Adult learning programmes</h3>

<p>221.	Adult learning comprises a rich variety of learning and training, such as programmes for those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, vocational training, employability training and community learning.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge, where appropriate, how well the curriculum, including the wider curriculum, for each strand of a provider’s adult learning programme has a clearly defined purpose that is relevant to the education and training needs and interests of learners, and to local employment opportunities, and supports local and national priorities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how effectively leaders, managers and governors focus public funding on people who are disadvantaged and least likely to participate in education and training, and work with other partners to widen participation and support learners’ progression to further learning and/or employment relevant to their personal circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will assess how well leaders and managers use community learning funding to develop learning programmes and projects that develop stronger communities, where appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how effectively staff work with learners, employers and other partners such as Jobcentre Plus, to ensure that teaching, learning and assessment enable learners to develop personal, social and employability skills that prepare them well for their intended job role, career aims and/or personal goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate, inspectors will judge how well providers record and recognise learners’ progress and achievements to inform teaching and support programmes to help learners reach their goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will also consider whether arrangements for safeguarding young people and vulnerable learners are appropriate and effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Apprenticeships</h3>

<p>222.	Inspectors will consider how well leaders and managers ensure that the apprenticeship curriculum meets the principles and requirements of an apprenticeship.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:56" rel="footnote">[footnote 56]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence will include the extent to which the provider’s staff engage with employers to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>complete the apprenticeship commitment statement</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>plan the initial assessment, training, assessments, review points and milestones throughout</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>agree any additional qualifications to be included</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>monitor and support apprentices, including those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and those who have high needs, to progress quickly, gain new knowledge, skills and behaviours and achieve to their full potential</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how well trainers, assessors, coaches and mentors communicate up-to-date vocational and technical subject knowledge that reflects expected industry practice and meets employers’ needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will determine whether apprentices acquire that knowledge effectively so that they demonstrate the required skills and behaviours that enable them to complete their apprenticeships, contribute to their workplace and fulfil their career aims by progressing to their intended job roles or other sustained employment, promotion or, where appropriate, moving to a higher level of apprenticeship or qualification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will also consider whether arrangements for safeguarding young people and vulnerable learners are appropriate and effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Provision for learners with high needs</h3>

<p>223.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/part/3/enacted" rel="external">Part 3 of the Children and Families Act 2014</a> explains the current arrangements for young people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. The Act aims to encourage education, health and social care services to work together. Local authorities must describe the provision available to young people in the area by publicising the ‘local offer’. A young person has a learning difficulty or disability if he or she has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a significantly greater difficulty in learning than most others of the same age</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a disability that prevents or hinders him or her from using the kind of facilities generally provided for others of the same age in general post-16 institutions</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>224.	Inspectors will consider the extent to which leaders, managers and governors use the funding for learners with high needs so that their individual learning programmes challenge learners to: develop their independence; improve their communication skills; make relevant personal choices and decisions; and prepare themselves for adult life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how successfully learners participate in good-quality and individually tailored learning programmes that lead to paid or voluntary employment where appropriate (including to supported internships, traineeships and apprenticeships) and/or to greater independence in their everyday lives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will evaluate how effectively leaders and managers coordinate all specialist support, including speech and language development, behaviour management, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, so that learners develop the skills they need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where appropriate, inspectors will determine the extent to which the choice of accreditation helps learners progress towards further learning, vocational training, employment and independent living.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge whether procedures for recognising and recording learners’ progress and achievement are rigorous and purposeful and support the achievement of all learners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will determine whether staff are suitably qualified and/or have appropriate expertise to support learners or specific groups of learners. They will determine whether learning resources, including assistive technology and online/remote learning resources, are to the required standard and specification and whether they are used effectively to support learners to overcome their barriers to achieving their challenging learning goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how successfully learners develop skills to enhance their employment opportunities and independence in their everyday lives in real-life situations, including meaningful work experience, and how well they take an active part in their local communities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will judge how well learners following academic or vocational qualifications make progress and achieve, compared with all learners on the same programme. They will also judge whether learners progress into appropriate paid or voluntary employment, further learning or other activities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will also consider whether arrangements for safeguarding learners are appropriate and effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The quality of education</h2>

<p>225.	Inspectors will take a rounded view of the quality of education that a provider delivers to its learners.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:57" rel="footnote">[footnote 57]</a></sup> They will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the provider’s curriculum, which embodies the decisions the provider has made about the knowledge, skills and behaviours its learners need to acquire to fulfil their aspirations for learning, employment and independence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the way that teachers teach and assess to support learners to build their knowledge and to apply that knowledge as skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the outcomes that learners achieve as a result of the education they have received</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>226.	Inspectors recognise that providers may have been unable to implement the curriculum in the usual way during the COVID-19 pandemic. They will seek to understand how leaders and managers adapted and prioritised the curriculum.</p>

<p>227.	Inspectors recognise that providers may have made some changes to some courses to have a short-term, specific focus for some or all learners. Where this is the case, there should be a clear rationale for why this is in those learners’ interest, and a clear plan for returning all learners to studying their full programme.</p>

<p>228.	Inspectors will seek to understand how the provider implemented the curriculum remotely.   Inspectors will also look at how managers and staff identified learning gaps and any new starting points of learners, and how managers and staff have responded to that in their curriculum planning.</p>

<p>229.	When we refer to the intent, implementation and impact of the curriculum and quality of education within this handbook, we are including remote education. We consider that education delivered remotely or online should be integrated into the programme of education/training, and be designed to support the wider implementation of the provider’s curriculum.</p>

<h3>Intent</h3>

<p>230.	In evaluating the provider’s educational intent, inspectors will primarily consider the curriculum leadership provided by senior and subject leaders.</p>

<p>231.	The evaluation focuses on factors that contribute to learners receiving education and training that enables them to achieve highly. These factors are listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders and managers have selected and developed a curriculum that develops the knowledge, skills and behaviours that learners need in order to take advantage of the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences that prepare them for their next stage in education, training or employment. In this way, it can powerfully address social disadvantage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is clear what the curriculum is preparing learners for. It is also clear what learners will need to be able to know and do at the end of their learning or training programmes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders, managers and teachers have planned and sequenced the curriculum so that learners can build on previous teaching and learning and develop the new knowledge and skills they need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum offers learners the knowledge and skills that reflect the needs of the local, regional and national context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum intent takes into account the needs of learners, employers, and the local, regional and national economy, as necessary. Curriculum planning takes account of delays and gaps that arise as a result of the pandemic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum ensures that all learners benefit from high academic, technical and vocational ambitions. This means that the curriculum should be ambitious for disadvantaged learners or those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, including those who have high needs, and should meet those needs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The curriculum</h3>

<p>232.	The curriculum sets out the aims of a programme of education and training. It also sets out the structure for those aims to be implemented, including the knowledge, skills and behaviours to be gained at each stage. It enables the evaluation of learners’ knowledge and understanding against those expectations.</p>

<p>233.	We will judge providers taking radically different approaches to the curriculum fairly. We recognise the importance of providers’ autonomy to choose their own curriculum approaches. If leaders are able to show that they have thought carefully, that they have built a curriculum with appropriate coverage, content, structure and sequencing, and that it has been implemented effectively, then inspectors will assess a provider’s curriculum favourably.</p>

<h3>Sources of evidence specific to curriculum intent</h3>

<p>234.	Inspectors will draw evidence about leaders’ intent for the curriculum principally from discussion with senior and subject leaders. Inspectors will explore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how leaders have ensured that a subject curriculum includes content that has been identified as most useful and that this content is taught in a logical progression, systematically and explicitly for all learners to acquire the intended knowledge, skills and behaviours. This includes understanding how the pandemic may have led to gaps in learners’ knowledge, learning delays and new starting points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how leaders ensure that the curriculum supports learners’ progression and provides knowledge and/or skills for the future (including non-qualification activity, where relevant)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how learners see links between different areas of knowledge and skills and recognise that some knowledge and skills are transferable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how carefully leaders have thought about the sequence of teaching knowledge and skills to build on what learners already know and can do</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>235.	Inspectors will also consider any documentary evidence that leaders wish to provide in the format that the provider normally uses. Inspectors will not request materials to be produced or provided in any specific format for inspection.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>236.	In evaluating the implementation of the curriculum, inspectors will focus on how the curriculum is taught at subject, class, lecture or workshop level.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:58" rel="footnote">[footnote 58]</a></sup></p>

<p>237.	We will focus on the following factors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers having expert knowledge of the subjects that they teach. If they do not, they are supported to address gaps so that learners are not disadvantaged by ineffective teaching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers enable learners to understand key concepts, presenting information clearly and promoting discussion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers check learners’ understanding effectively, and identify and correct misunderstandings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers ensure that learners embed key concepts in their long-term memory and apply them fluently and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders and teachers have designed and they deliver the subject curriculum in a way that allows learners to transfer key knowledge to long-term memory. The curriculum is sequenced so that new knowledge and skills build on what learners know and can do and learners can work towards defined end points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers use assessment to check learners’ understanding in order to inform teaching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers use assessment to help learners to embed and use knowledge fluently, to develop their understanding, and to gain, extend and improve their skills and not simply memorise disconnected facts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The use of assessment</h3>

<p>238.	When used effectively, assessment can help learners to embed and use knowledge fluently and to show that they are competent in applying their skills. The results of effective assessment assist teachers to produce clear and achievable next steps for learners. However, assessment is too often carried out in a way that creates unnecessary burdens for staff and learners. It is therefore important that leaders and teachers understand its limitations and avoid misuse and overuse.</p>

<p>239.	Inspectors will evaluate how assessment supports the teaching of the curriculum, while not driving teachers towards excessive individualisation, differentiation or interventions that are almost impossible to deliver without lowering expectations of some learners and/or driving up teachers’ workload. This will include considering how the provider responds to any learning gaps that have arisen as a result of the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Sources of evidence specific to curriculum implementation</h3>

<p>240.	The following activities will provide inspectors with evidence about the provider’s implementation of its intended curriculum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with subject specialists, subject leaders and teachers about:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the curriculum that learners follow</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the intended end points towards which those learners are working</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>their view of how those learners are progressing through the curriculum</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reviews of curriculum plans or other long-term planning (in whatever form teachers and/or subject leaders usually produce and use them)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visits to classes, lectures, workshops and other activities, including observations of teaching and training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scrutinising work produced by learners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interviews with learners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with teachers about how often they are expected to record, upload and review data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with subject specialists and leaders about the content and pedagogical content knowledge of teachers, and what is done to support teachers, including with remote teaching</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with staff, including specialist staff, who support learners in developing their knowledge, skills and behaviours</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where relevant, discussions with subject leaders and teachers about how the curriculum has been delivered remotely and reviews of learners’ work completed remotely</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>241.	In order to triangulate evidence effectively, inspectors will ensure that they gather a variety of these types of evidence in relation to the same sample of learners. Inspectors will also ensure that the samples of learners they choose are sufficient to allow them to reach a valid and sufficiently reliable judgement on the quality of education offered by the provider overall.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>

<p>242.	When inspectors evaluate the impact of the education provided by the provider, they will focus on what learners have learned, and the skills they have gained and can apply.</p>

<p>243.	Inspectors will focus on the following factors.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A well-constructed, well-taught curriculum will lead to learners learning more and so achieving good results. There need be no conflict between teaching a broad, rich curriculum and achieving success in examinations and tests or assessments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disadvantaged learners and learners with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> acquire the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End-point assessments and examinations are useful indicators of learners’ outcomes, but they only represent a sample of what learners have learned. Inspectors will balance this with their first-hand assessment of learners’ work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All learning builds towards an end point. Learners are being prepared for their next stage of education, training or employment at each stage of their learning. Inspectors will consider whether learners are ready for their next steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspectors will also consider whether learners are ready for the next stage and are going to appropriate, high-quality destinations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources of evidence specific to curriculum impact</h3>

<p>244.	Inspectors will gather evidence of the impact of the education offered by the provider from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>nationally generated and validated performance information about learners’ progress and attainment, where it is available in published national data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first-hand evidence of the progress learners are making, drawing together the evidence from the interviews, observations, work scrutiny and documentary review, described above (see ‘sources of evidence specific to curriculum implementation’)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any information provided by the provider about the destinations to which their learners progress when they leave the provider</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>telephone conversations or other similar discussions with a selection of learners about their destinations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with learners, for instance about what they have remembered about the knowledge and skills they have acquired and how their learning enables them to connect ideas</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>245.	Inspectors will evaluate learners’ progress in relation to their starting points, based on their rate of learning, acquisition of knowledge, skills and behaviours and whether they have achieved their individual, challenging learning goals.</p>

<p>246.	Inspectors will not look at internal progress and attainment data on GCSE and A-level courses where fixed-time terminal examinations comprise the entire assessment of the course. Similarly, inspectors will not normally look at predicted in-year achievement and attainment data more generally.</p>

<p>247.	That does not mean providers cannot use this data if they consider it appropriate. However, inspectors will put more focus on the curriculum and less on providers’ generation, analysis and interpretation of performance data. Inspectors will be interested in the conclusions drawn and actions taken from any internal assessment information, but they will not examine or verify that information first hand.</p>

<h3>Balancing intent, implementation and impact to reach a quality of education judgement</h3>

<p>248.	Inspectors will not grade intent, implementation and impact separately. Instead, inspectors will reach a single graded judgement for the quality of education and training, drawing on all the evidence they have gathered and using their professional judgement.</p>

<h2>Grade descriptors for quality of education</h2>

<p>249.	For the quality of education provided to be judged outstanding, it must meet the following criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provider meets all the criteria for a good quality of education securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of education is exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provider’s curriculum intent is strong. Throughout the provider and its subcontractors, teachers have a firm and common understanding of the intended curriculum and what it means for their practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider’s implementation of the curriculum is consistently strong. Across all parts of the provider, including in subcontracted provision and for learners with SEND and those with high needs, teaching and training are of a high quality. Training activities contribute well to delivering the curriculum intent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work that learners do over time embodies consistently demanding curriculum goals. It matches the aims of the curriculum in being coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The impact of the taught curriculum is strong. Learners acquire and develop high-quality skills and produce work of a consistently high standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners consistently achieve highly, particularly the most disadvantaged. Learners with SEND achieve the best possible outcomes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>250.	To judge whether the quality of education is good, requires improvement or is inadequate, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the professional judgement of the inspection team.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders adopt or construct a curriculum that is ambitious, appropriately relevant to local, regional and national employment and training priorities and designed to give learners, particularly the most disadvantaged, the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider is ambitious for all its learners, including those with SEND and those who have high needs, and this is reflected in the curriculum. The curriculum remains ambitious and is tailored, where necessary, to meet individual needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners study the intended curriculum. Providers ensure this by teaching all components of the full programmes of study.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers have expert knowledge of the subject(s) and courses they teach. Leaders provide effective support, including for those teaching outside their main areas of expertise. Where relevant, teachers have extensive and up-to-date vocational experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers present information and/or demonstrate skills clearly, promoting appropriate consideration of the subject matter being taught. They check learners’ understanding systematically, identify misconceptions and provide clear, direct feedback. In doing this, they respond and adapt their teaching as necessary, but without having to use unnecessary, time-consuming, individual approaches to presenting subject matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work that teachers give to learners is demanding and ensures that learners build knowledge and acquire skills, improving on what they already know and can do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers encourage learners to use subject-specific, professional and technical vocabulary well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers work effectively with support staff to ensure that all learners achieve as they should.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of study, teachers design and use activities to help learners remember long term the content they have been taught, to integrate new knowledge into larger concepts and to apply skills fluently and independently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers and leaders use assessment well, for example to help learners embed and use knowledge fluently and flexibly, to evaluate the application of skills, to check understanding and inform teaching, or to understand different starting points and gaps as a result of the pandemic. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and do not use it in a way that creates unnecessary burdens for staff or learners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers create an environment that allows the learner to focus on learning. The resources and materials that teachers and trainers select and produce – in a way that does not create unnecessary workload for staff – reflect the provider’s ambitious intentions for the course of study and clearly support the intent of a coherently planned curriculum, sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning, independent living and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any remote education is well integrated into the programme of education/training, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the provider’s curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners develop detailed knowledge across the curriculum and, as a result, achieve well across all areas of their study. Learners make substantial and sustained progress from their identified and recorded starting points in each of their courses and, where applicable, across the curriculum. Where appropriate and available, impact is reflected in results from national examinations, which meet government expectations, or in the qualifications or apprenticeship standards obtained (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#data">paragraphs 146 to 148</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners are ready for the next stage of education, employment or training. They have gained qualifications or have met the standards to go on to destinations that meet their interests and aspirations and the goal of their course of study. Learners with SEND/high needs have greater independence in making decisions about their lives.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<p>The quality of education is likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies (unless they apply solely due to the impact of COVID-19):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum has little or no structure or coherence, and leaders have not appropriately considered sequencing. Learners experience a jumbled, disconnected series of lessons/training that do not build their knowledge, skills or understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners’ experiences in lessons or sessions contribute weakly to their learning of the intended curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum does not prepare learners for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of life in modern Britain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weak assessment practice results in teaching that fails to meet learners’ needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners do not develop or improve the English and mathematical skills they need to succeed in their next stage, whether that is in education, training or employment or in greater independence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attainment and progress of learners are consistently low and show little or no improvement over time, indicating that learners are underachieving considerably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners with SEND do not benefit from a good-quality education. Staff’s expectations of them are low. Staff do not identify learners’ needs accurately, and are therefore unable to support learners’ development effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners have not attained the qualifications, skills or behaviours appropriate for them to progress to their next stage of education, training or employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum does not meet the needs of learners or employers, the local community or local, regional or national economies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>251.	This judgement considers how leaders and staff create a safe, disciplined and positive environment within the provider and the impact this has on the behaviour and attitudes of learners.</p>

<p>252.	The judgement focuses on the factors that research and inspection evidence indicate contribute most strongly to learners’ positive behaviour and attitudes, thereby giving them the greatest possible opportunity to achieve positive outcomes. These factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A calm and orderly environment in the provider, classroom, workshop and workplace, as this is essential for learners to be able to learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting of clear expectations for behaviour across all aspects of provider life, including at work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong focus on attendance at and punctuality to learning and work settings to minimise disruption, and so that learners gain valuable employability skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learner motivation and positive attitudes to learning are important predictors of attainment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A positive and respectful provider culture in which staff know and care about learners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An environment in which learners feel safe because staff and learners do not accept bullying, harassment or discrimination or peer-on-peer abuse<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:59" rel="footnote">[footnote 59]</a></sup> – online or offline. Staff deal with any issues quickly, consistently and effectively.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Learners with particular needs</h3>

<p>253.	The provider may be working with learners with particular needs to improve their behaviour or their attendance. When this is the case, ‘behaviour and conduct that reflect the provider’s high expectations and their consistent, fair implementation’ are likely to indicate improvement in the attendance, punctuality and conduct of these learners. In the case of some groups of learners, COVID-19 may have affected their transition to further education. This may demonstrate itself in attitudes to learning or work that are not yet in keeping with the provider’s high expectations.</p>

<p>254.	Some learners, or groups of learners, who have particular needs may have weak attendance or display challenging behaviour. When this is the case, inspectors will evaluate the impact of the provider’s high expectations, the consistent, fair implementation of policies, the support given by the provider to the learners, and the impact on the marked and sustained improvement of the attendance and behaviour of these learners.</p>

<h3>Sources of evidence specific to behaviour and attitudes</h3>

<p>255.	Inspectors will use evidence gathered during the inspection as well as evidence of trends in learners’ behaviour and attitudes over time. Inspectors will use first-hand evidence from visits to learning sessions and training workshops, including visits to learners at work or on work placements. Inspectors will also gather evidence from interviews with learners, staff, employers and other partners, for which documents such as attendance registers may also be used.</p>

<p>256.	Inspectors’ judgements about learners’ behaviour and attitudes are concerned with their attitudes to learning and, where appropriate, to work, and the development of the skills relevant to their learning programme. Inspectors’ judgements also take account of learners’ ability to demonstrate appropriate behaviour for the learning and work environments. Inspectors will consider the main purpose of the type of provision when they prioritise the impact that each of the criteria has on learners’ behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<p>257.	The learner and staff surveys used in inspection contain questions about safeguarding, how respondents feel about the provider and how well supported and respected they feel in the provider .</p>

<p>258.	Inspectors will carry out other evidence-gathering activities that include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>observing learners’ behaviour in a range of different classes/workshops at different times of the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing learners’ punctuality in arriving at the provider, to classroom and workshop sessions and to work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing learners’ courtesy, respect for, and good manners towards, each other and adults, and pride in themselves and their provider and/or employer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reviewing documentary evidence about behaviour, including how the provider tackles challenging behaviour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering the views of learners, employers, parents, staff, those with responsibility for governance and other stakeholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering evidence about the typical behaviour of learners who are not on site during the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>balancing evidence seen during the inspection and evidence of trends over time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>259.	For the behaviour and attitudes of a provider to be judged outstanding, it must meet the following criteria:</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provider must meet all the criteria for good behaviour and attitudes, securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behaviour and attitudes are exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Learners have consistently high levels of respect for others. They play a highly positive role in creating an environment that values and nurtures difference. Bullying and harassment are never tolerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners demonstrate consistently high positive attitudes and commitment to their education and/or training. They are persistent in the face of difficulties. If learners struggle with this, the provider takes intelligent, swift and highly effective action to support them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many examples of commitment beyond the basics, for example high participation in skills competitions or social action projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners behave consistently well, demonstrating high levels of self-control and consistently positive attitudes to their education and/or training. If learners struggle with this, the provider takes intelligent, fair and highly effective action to support them to succeed in their programme of learning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>260.	To judge whether behaviour and attitudes are good, requires improvement or are inadequate, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the professional judgement of the inspection team.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Providers have high expectations of learners’ behaviour and conduct and these are applied consistently and fairly. This is reflected in learners’ behaviours and conduct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners’ attitudes to their education or training are positive. They improve their attitudes over time. They understand their rights and responsibilities as learners. They are committed to their learning, know how to study effectively, are resilient to setbacks and take pride in their achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners have high attendance (bearing in mind the context of the pandemic as necessary) and are punctual. This includes participating in any distance-learning activities, such as online learning and virtual learning environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relationships among learners and staff reflect a positive and respectful culture where the principles of equality and diversity are nurtured. Learners feel safe and rarely experience bullying, harassment or discrimination. If incidents occur, learners feel safe and confident to report them, knowing that staff will take swift and appropriate action.</p>

    <p>Learners’ lack of engagement, motivation or enthusiasm inhibits their progress and development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A significant minority of learners show a lack of respect and self-discipline. Learners ignore or rebut requests to moderate their conduct and are not ready to move on to their next stage or the world of work.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Learners’ attendance is consistently low and shows little sign of sustained improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidents of bullying, harassment or prejudiced and discriminatory behaviour, both direct and indirect, are frequent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners have little confidence in the provider’s ability to tackle bullying, harassment or discrimination successfully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners are not safe, or do not feel safe, at the provider or at work or subcontractor settings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Personal development</h2>

<p>261.	The curriculum should support learners to develop their knowledge and skills beyond the purely academic, technical or vocational. This judgement evaluates the provider’s intent to provide for the personal development of learners, and the quality of the way in which it does this.</p>

<p>262.	As the provider is working with learners, those learners are also being influenced by other factors in their home environment, their community and elsewhere. Providers can teach and train learners how to build their confidence and resilience, for example, but they cannot determine how well young people and adult learners draw on this. Similarly, providers cannot make their learners active, engaged citizens, but they can help them understand how to engage with society and provide them with plentiful opportunities to do so. Providers can take effective action to prepare learners for many aspects of life, but the impact of this work may not be seen until many years later. In this judgement, therefore, inspectors will seek to evaluate the quality and intent of what a provider offers and will look to see what learners know but will not attempt to measure the impact of the provider’s work on the lives of individual learners. Where the usual opportunities have been disrupted by the pandemic, the provider has found alternative approaches to providing a rich range of personal development opportunities.</p>

<p>263.	When forming judgements about personal development, inspectors will seek to understand what took place before the pandemic, what the provider has in place currently and what its future plans are. Inspectors recognise that many elements of personal development that were in place before the pandemic may have been disrupted. Therefore, they will focus on understanding the steps that leaders have taken to offer or to restore a wide range of personal development opportunities.</p>

<p>264.	The judgement focuses on the most significant dimensions of the personal development of learners that our education system has agreed, either by consensus or statute, are the most significant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>developing responsible, respectful and active citizens who are able to play their part and know how to become involved in public life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing and deepening learners’ understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law and mutual respect and tolerance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promoting equality of opportunity so that all learners can thrive together, understanding that difference is a positive, not a negative, and that individual characteristics make people unique</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promoting an inclusive environment that meets the needs of all learners, irrespective of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation, relationship status or pregnancy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing learners’ character, which we define as the set of positive personal traits, dispositions and virtues that informs their motivation and guides their conduct so that they reflect wisely, learn eagerly, behave with integrity and cooperate consistently well with others. This gives learners the qualities they need to flourish in our society</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing learners’ confidence, resilience and knowledge so that they can keep themselves mentally healthy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing learners’ understanding of how to keep physically healthy and maintain an active lifestyle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing an age-appropriate understanding of healthy relationships through appropriate relationship and sex education<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:60" rel="footnote">[footnote 60]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>providing an effective careers programme that offers advice, experience and contact with employers to encourage learners to aspire, make good choices and understand what they need to do in order to reach and succeed in their chosen career</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supporting readiness for the next phase of education, training or employment so that learners can make the transition to the next stage successfully</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>265.	These aspects of personal development will be considered in an age-appropriate way within the context of the provider and its learners.</p>

<h3>Sources of evidence specific to personal development</h3>

<p>266.	To inform this judgement, inspectors will use evidence gathered during the inspection and evidence of trends in learners’ personal development over time. Inspectors will use first-hand evidence from visits to learning sessions and training workshops, including visits to learners at work or on work placements. Inspectors will gather evidence from interviews with learners, staff, employers and other partners. Evidence will also include information provided through learner, employer and parent questionnaires. Inspectors will use a range of evidence to evaluate personal development, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the range, quality and take-up of extra-curricular activities offered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders promote British values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders develop learners’ character through the quality of education that they provide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where appropriate, the quality of debate and discussions that learners have</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learners’ understanding of the protected characteristics and how they can promote equality and diversity, and how they celebrate the things we have in common</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of careers information, education, advice and guidance, and how well these benefit learners in choosing and deciding on their next steps</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learners’ understanding of what constitutes healthy relationships</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for personal development</h2>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provider consistently and extensively promotes the personal development of learners. The provider goes beyond the expected, so that learners have access to a wide, rich set of experiences that teach them why it is important to contribute actively to society. Opportunities for learners to develop their talents and interests are of exceptional quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider ensures that participation in these activities is very high, particularly among those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and all benefit from these opportunities and experiences.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider prepares learners for future success in education, employment or training by providing: unbiased information to all about potential next steps; high-quality, up-to-date and locally relevant careers guidance; and opportunities for encounters with the world of work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider prepares learners for life in modern Britain by: teaching them how to protect themselves from radicalisation and extremist views; helping to equip them to be responsible, respectful, active citizens who contribute positively to society; developing their understanding of fundamental British values; developing their understanding and appreciation of diversity; celebrating what we have in common; and promoting respect for the different protected characteristics as defined in law.</p>

<p>269.	Inspectors will look at the work of principals, chief executives, senior leaders, deans, heads of apprenticeships, subject leaders and others with leadership and management roles when reaching this judgement.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:61" rel="footnote">[footnote 61]</a></sup></p>

<p>270.	This judgement is about how leaders, managers and those responsible for governance ensure that the education and training delivered by the provider have a positive impact on all learners, including those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and those who have high needs.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:62" rel="footnote">[footnote 62]</a></sup> It focuses on the areas in which inspection evidence and research show that leaders and managers can have the strongest impact on the quality of education and training provided. Important factors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders’ high expectations of all learners and the extent to which these are embodied in day-to-day interactions with and support for learners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders focus their attention on the education and training they provide, leading to better outcomes for learners and continued and sustainable improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether continuing professional development for teachers, trainers and other staff is aligned with the curriculum, and the extent to which this develops teachers’ subject expertise and pedagogical knowledge over time, so that they deliver high-quality education and training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders ensure that learners benefit from effective teaching and high expectations in classrooms, online, in workshops, at work or with subcontractors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders engage with learners, parents, their community and employers to plan and support the education and training that learners get and to meet the skills needs of the economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders consider the workload and well-being of their staff, while also developing and strengthening the quality of the workforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders’ and managers’ high ambitions are for all learners, including those who are difficult to engage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders and those responsible for governance understand their respective roles and carry these out to enhance the effectiveness of the provider</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>271.	Inspectors will seek evidence of the impact of those responsible for governance. They will determine whether they provide confident, strategic leadership and create strong accountability for, and oversight and assurance of, educational performance to ensure continuous and sustainable improvement.</p>

<p>272.	Inspectors should consider whether those responsible for governance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>know the provider and understand its strengths and weaknesses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support and strengthen the provider’s leadership and contribute to shaping its strategic direction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that the provider meets its statutory responsibilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide challenge and hold senior leaders and managers to account for improving the quality of learning and the effectiveness of performance management systems</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>273.	Inspectors will satisfy themselves that those responsible for governance understand their responsibilities and are ensuring that these are carried out appropriately within the provider. They are not expected to review a list of duties with inspectors.</p>

<h3>College groups and governance arrangements</h3>

<p>274.	Many providers cooperate as groups, with an overall board and chief executive officer, or similar arrangement. These assume some or all of the responsibilities formerly shouldered by the individual college’s/provider’s governing body. In these providers, inspectors will seek evidence of the impact of the overall board and its staff as well as the college’s/provider’s local board, committee or governing body, to which there are relevant delegated responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>275.	All providers should have a culture of safeguarding. This means they should have effective arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>always act in the best interests of children<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:63" rel="footnote">[footnote 63]</a></sup> and learners to protect them online and offline, including when they are receiving remote education or self-isolating due to COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify children and learners who may need early help, and who are at risk of harm or have been harmed. This can include, but is not limited to, neglect, abuse (including by their peers), grooming or exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secure the help that children and learners need and, if required, refer concerns in a timely way to those who have the expertise to help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure safe recruitment and manage ongoing compliance and allegations about adults who may be a risk to children and vulnerable adults</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>276.	Inspectors will always take into account how well providers help and protect young people and learners so that they are kept safe, including when learning remotely.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:64" rel="footnote">[footnote 64]</a></sup> Inspectors evaluate the safeguarding culture that has been established by the provider. Although inspectors will not provide a separate numerical grade for this, they will always make a written judgement in the leadership and management section of the inspection report about whether the arrangements for safeguarding young people and learners are effective.</p>

<p>277.	If safeguarding is ineffective, this is likely to lead to a judgement of inadequate leadership and management. The following are examples of what ineffective safeguarding might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>learners’ behaviour towards each other is unsafe, putting learners at risk of harm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incidents of bullying or prejudiced and discriminatory behaviour, either direct or indirect, are common</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learners have little confidence that the provider will address concerns about their safety, including concerns about the risk of abuse, including sexual abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>learners or particular groups of learners do not feel safe in the provider, the workplace, in a subcontractor’s premises or online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers do not handle safeguarding allegations about staff members and learners appropriately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers do not have suitable arrangements for learners to raise concerns, for identifying vulnerable adults or for managing safe recruitment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders fail to protect learners from the dangers of radicalisation and extremism in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prevent-duty-guidance">‘Prevent’ duty guidance</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>278.	However, there may be circumstances when it is appropriate to judge a provider as requires improvement, rather than inadequate, when there are minor weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements that are easy to put right. We will assess safeguarding arrangements in an age-appropriate way, taking account of the age and vulnerability of the learners involved.</p>

<p>279.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a> sets out the approach inspectors should take to inspecting safeguarding in providers covered by the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>. This should be read alongside the framework and this handbook.</p>

<p>280.	In addition, inspectors should be familiar with relevant, including statutory, guidance on safeguarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education: statutory guidance for schools and colleges’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2.">‘Working together to safeguard children’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-environments-where-children-can-flourish">‘Positive environments where children can flourish’</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>281.	Inspectors will discuss how safeguarding arrangements have changed over time due to the pandemic, and how leaders and managers have made sure that they remain effective.</p>

<h3>Sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse between learners who are children or young people</h3>

<p>282.	As part of assessing safeguarding, inspectors will consider how colleges and providers<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:65" rel="footnote">[footnote 65]</a></sup> that have learners who are children<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:66" rel="footnote">[footnote 66]</a></sup> handle concerns about harmful sexual behaviour towards or between learners who are children and young people (including sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse). This includes considering whether the college or provider has followed the relevant <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance about peer-on-peer abuse between children, and whether:<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:67" rel="footnote">[footnote 67]</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the provider has appropriate provider-wide policies and procedures in place that make it clear that all harmful sexual behaviour is unacceptable and that assume that sexual harassment and online sexual abuse are happening in the provision, even when there are no specific reports</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provider’s policies are reflected in their curriculum,<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:68" rel="footnote">[footnote 68]</a></sup> which specifically addresses sexual harassment and violence, online sexual abuse and language and consent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all staff are clear as to the provider’s relevant policy and procedures, and this is supported by relevant training</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all learners are supported to report concerns about sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concerns are taken seriously and dealt with swiftly and appropriately, and learners are confident that this is case</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comprehensive records of concerns are kept</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the provider has taken into account the findings and recommendations of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges/review-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-and-colleges">Ofsted’s review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>283.	Inspectors will also look at how providers work to prevent sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse between learners using a whole-provider approach that includes an effective behaviour policy, pastoral support and a carefully planned curriculum with respect to relationship and sex education. Inspectors will expect providers to be alert to factors that increase the vulnerability or potential vulnerability of learners, such as mental ill health, domestic abuse, children with additional needs, and learners from groups at greater risk of harm (including vulnerable adults). Inspectors will also seek to understand how any barriers that could prevent a learner from making a disclosure, for example communication needs, are identified and addressed.</p>

<p>284.	As set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a> inspectors will expect, among other things, providers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand how to handle reports of harmful sexual behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>between learners, both on and outside college or provider premises, in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sexual-violence-and-sexual-harassment-between-children-in-schools-and-colleges"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance on sexual violence and sexual harassment</a>, and train their staff accordingly</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have good awareness of the signs that a child/young person who is a learner is being neglected or abused, as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused--2">‘What to do if you’re worried a child is being abused’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be confident about what to do if a learner reports that they have experienced sexual harassment, online sexual abuse or sexual violence involving another learner</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that learners are taught about safeguarding risks, including online risks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support learners to understand what constitutes a healthy relationship, both online and offline<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:69" rel="footnote">[footnote 69]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>285.	Inspectors will not investigate concerns of sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse themselves, but will ensure that allegations are reported to the appropriate authority as appropriate, where that has not already happened.</p>

<p>286.	Where providers do not have effective policies and processes in place, it is likely that safeguarding will be considered ineffective. This is likely to impact on the leadership and management judgement. We will assess these arrangements in an age-appropriate way, taking account of the age and vulnerability of the learners involved. Inspectors may also, depending on the circumstances, take this evidence into account when considering the behaviour and attitude and personal development judgements (particularly in respect of learners feeling safe and pastoral support respectively).</p>

<h4>Sources of evidence specific to leadership and management</h4>

<p>287.	Inspectors will gather a range of evidence from meetings with leaders, managers and governors and first-hand evidence of their work across the provider, including in subcontracted provision.</p>

<p>288.	Inspectors will use documentary evidence that the provider supplies to evaluate the impact of the work of leaders, managers and governors, both currently and over time. They will use this in conjunction with first-hand evidence. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meetings with leaders and those responsible for governance, to evaluate how well they fulfil their statutory duties with respect to equality and safeguarding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documentary evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of the provision for all learners and its continuous and sustainable improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interviews with staff and learners to evidence how well leaders have created a positive culture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first-hand evidence gathered during the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responses to the staff, learner, employer and parent/carer questionnaires. These will be particularly useful for judging the culture that leaders and managers have established</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any evidence the provider has from surveying the staff and the way in which leaders and managers have responded to concerns raised by staff, parents or employers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>considering the overall aims of bodies giving strategic direction to providers on skills and economic needs, such as mayoral and combined authorities for devolved adult education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>records and analysis of safeguarding concerns, including those relating to sexual harassment and violence and online sexual abuse</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for leadership and management</h2>

<p>289.	For the leadership and management of a provider to be judged outstanding, it must meet the following criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The provider meets all the criteria for good leadership and management securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The leadership and management are exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders ensure that teachers receive focused and highly effective professional development. Teachers’ subject, vocational, technical, pedagogical and pedagogical content knowledge builds and develops consistently over time and improves the quality of education provided to learners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders’ engagement with learners, employers, parents and the local community/economy is very effective. They provide clear and direct evidence of the positive impact of how this engagement benefits learners and ensures continuous and sustainable improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders ensure that regular, frequent and meaningful engagement takes place with staff at all levels, so that they can be confident that issues will be identified. When issues are identified – in particular about workload – leaders deal with them consistently, appropriately and quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff consistently report high levels of support for well-being issues.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>290.	To judge whether leadership and management are good, requires improvement or inadequate, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the professional judgement of the inspection team.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders have a clear and ambitious vision for providing high-quality, inclusive education and training to all. This is realised through strong, shared values, policies and practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders focus on improving teachers’ subject and teaching knowledge to enhance the teaching of the curriculum and the appropriate use of assessment. The practice, subject knowledge and up-to-date vocational expertise of staff build and improve over time. This includes their expertise in remote education.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders ensure that all learners, including those with SEND and high needs, and disadvantaged learners, get the information, advice, guidance and support to achieve their next steps and progress to positive destinations. Leaders provide the support for staff to make this possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders engage effectively with their community, including, where relevant, with parents/carers, employers, local services and organisations responsible for local and regional economic planning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders engage with their staff and are aware and take account of the main pressures on them. They are realistic and constructive in the way they manage staff, including their workload.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those responsible for governance understand their role and carry this out effectively. They ensure that the provider has a clear vision and strategy and that resources are managed well. They hold leaders to account for the quality of education and training and help to ensure continuous and sustainable improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those responsible for governance ensure that the provider fulfils its legal duties and responsibilities. These include, for example, those under the Equality Act 2010, and those in relation to the ‘Prevent’ strategy and safeguarding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders protect staff from harassment, bullying and discrimination.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider has an effective culture of safeguarding that enables staff to: identify, help and protect learners who may need early help or who are at risk of neglect, abuse, grooming, exploitation, radicalisation or extremism; help learners to reduce their risk of harm by securing the support they need, or referring in a timely way to those who have the expertise to help; and manage safe recruitment and allegations about adults and learners who may be a risk to other learners and vulnerable adults.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Requires improvement (3)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leadership and management are not yet good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding is effective. If any weaknesses in safeguarding exist, these are not difficult to rectify, and there are no serious failings that leave learners being harmed or at risk of harm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<p>Leadership and management are likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders are not doing enough to tackle a poor quality of education or training. This significantly impairs the progress of learners, including the most disadvantaged, learners with SEND and those who have high needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders are not aware of, or do not take effective action to stem, the decline in the quality of provision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders do not engage effectively with key stakeholders and so the curriculum fails to meet the needs of learners, employers, the local community or local and regional economies. This is reflected in the low proportion of learners who progress to destinations relevant to their career or learning aims.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum does not equip learners with the skills, knowledge or understanding required to prepare them for life in modern Britain or enable them to progress to their next steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders, managers and those responsible for governance, through their words, actions or influence, directly and/or indirectly undermine or fail to promote equality of opportunity. They do not prevent discriminatory behaviour or prejudiced actions and views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Safeguarding is ineffective. The provider’s arrangements for safeguarding learners do not meet statutory requirements and do not protect learners, or the provider takes insufficient action to remedy weaknesses following a serious failure of safeguarding arrangements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders, managers and governors are not protecting learners from radicalisation and extremist views. Policy and practice are poor, which means that learners are at risk.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>The contribution of colleges and designated institutions to meeting skills needs: sub-judgement and criteria</h2>

<h3>Background and context</h3>

<p>291.	All providers should be contributing effectively to meeting the skills needs of employers and the local, regional and national economy through the range of programmes that they teach, the content and planning of that curriculum and their engagement and collaboration with employers and stakeholders.</p>

<p>292.	When evaluating the quality of education in further education and skills providers, inspectors evaluate (among other things) whether the curriculum offers learners the knowledge and skills that reflect the needs of the local, regional and national context, and whether the curriculum intent takes into account the needs of learners, employers and the local, regional and national economy, as necessary (see paragraph 231).</p>

<p>293.	When evaluating the impact of leadership and management, inspectors evaluate (among other things) whether leaders engage with their community and with employers to plan and support the education and training that learners get, and to meet the skills needs of the economy.</p>

<p>294.	From September 2022, inspectors will, in addition, specifically evaluate the extent to which all further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions (referred to collectively in relation to this section and sub-judgement as ‘colleges’) contribute effectively towards meeting the skills needs of employers and other relevant stakeholders and the local, regional and national economy. This evaluation will include a sub-judgement on the college’s contribution to meeting skills needs. This sub-judgement is linked to and dependent on the quality of education and leadership and management key judgements. As a sub-judgement, it will feed into the quality of education and leadership and management key judgements.</p>

<p>295.	This evaluation will take into account not just skills needed immediately for employment, including for those already in employment, but also skills which are necessary to ensure students’ progress towards employment, in necessary stages by means of further and higher education, training, work experience and increased personal independence at all levels.</p>

<p>296.	Providers may contribute to regional and national skills needs, as well as local skills needs. Many providers have specialisms that meet those needs across one or more region, or meet national skills needs. Some are specialist colleges that are mainly focused on regional and national needs. Where colleges teach A-level and other qualifications where the students’ next steps are likely to be into higher education, their focus is on meeting the skills needs of those students to progress to that next stage that will often lead, in due course, to employment outside of the locality or region. Consequently, we will refer to skills needs as a whole.</p>

<p>297.	The sub-judgement will only relate to provision which is within Ofsted’s inspection scope as set out in this handbook (see paragraphs 77 and 86).</p>

<h3>Sub-judgement on the college’s contribution to skills needs</h3>

<p>298.	Inspectors will arrive at one of the following judgements about the college’s contribution to skills needs:</p>

<p>299.	The college makes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a limited contribution to meeting skills needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a reasonable contribution to meeting skills needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a strong contribution to meeting skills needs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sub-judgement criteria</h3>

<p>300.	The college will be considered to be making a limited contribution to meeting skills needs if inspectors find that one or more of the following criteria applies to it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers do not engage effectively enough with employers and other relevant stakeholders to understand the skills needs of the local, regional and national economy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers do not involve employers and other relevant stakeholders sufficiently in the design and implementation of the curriculum to prepare learners effectively for future education, employment or work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers are not sufficiently clear how they are contributing to skills needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers do not ensure that the curriculum is planned and/or taught effectively, so learners and apprentices do not yet learn the skills they need</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>301.	The college will be considered to be making a reasonable contribution to meeting skills needs if it is not meeting any of the limited contribution criteria, but is not yet meeting all of the strong contribution criteria.</p>

<p>302.	The college will be considered to be making a strong contribution to meeting skills needs if all of the following criteria apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers engage very effectively with employers and other relevant stakeholders to understand the skills needs of the local, regional and national economy, and plan their curriculum accordingly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers involve employers and other relevant stakeholders very effectively in the design and implementation of the curriculum to prepare students for future education, employment or work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers are very clear how they contribute to skills needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and managers ensure that the curriculum is planned and taught effectively, so that learners and apprentices learn the skills they need</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources of evidence for contributing to meeting skills needs sub-judgement</h3>

<p>303.	Inspectors will already draw much relevant information and evidence on this from the normal course of the full inspection.</p>

<p>304.	Inspectors will draw further, more detailed evidence about colleges’ contribution to meeting skills needs principally from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>discussions and meetings with the college’s leaders and managers (including curriculum managers)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions and meetings with stakeholders of the college in respect of skills needs as set out in paragraph 101</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from the college’s own plans, any accountability agreement (<abbr title="Accountability Agreement">AA</abbr>), local skills improvement plan (<abbr title="local skills improvement plan">LSIP</abbr>), or similar agreements or plans in place from time to time (whether draft or published)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information and data about skills needs from published sources (such as LEP plans and Skills Advisory Panel (SAP) plans)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

A provider that has been removed from the RoATP for reasons other than being judged inadequate and whose only funding is for apprenticeship provision will not normally receive a monitoring visit or a full inspection while removed from the RoATP.

    If the provider only delivers one type of provision, for example apprenticeship training, and the learner numbers are very low and inspectors are doubtful that they can gather sufficient evidence to arrive at the necessary judgements for a full inspection, Ofsted may postpone the full inspection or carry out a monitoring visit in place of the full inspection. If the provider only delivers apprenticeship training and the learner numbers are very low, inspectors are doubtful that they can gather sufficient evidence to arrive at the necessary judgements for a full inspection and the provider’s last monitoring visit judged the provider to be making insufficient progress in one or more themes (and the provider cannot take on more apprentices), Ofsted will normally carry out a monitoring visit in place of the full inspection. When a monitoring visit is carried out to replace a full inspection, it will normally follow the arrangement as set out in the table later in this handbook covering the 3 set themes.

    These expectations apply to colleges (general further education colleges, sixth-form colleges and designated institutions). Since 1 November 2021, Ofsted has had the same expectations of independent learning providers, independent specialist colleges and 16 to 19 academies where they provide for those aged under 18 years of age. This followed the passage of The Education and Training (Welfare of Children) Act 2021, which came into effect from 29 June 2021. This means that the latest version of the DfE’s statutory guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education’</a> in force from September 2021 applies to these types of providers as well as to colleges (see pages 3 to 4).<a aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:65" role="doc-backlink">↩</a>

    In England, a child is defined as anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday.
