<p>This guidance will come into force on 1 September 2022. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-schools-inspection-handbook-eif/non-association-independent-schools-handbook--2">current inspection guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This handbook describes the main activities carried out during standard inspections of non-association independent schools in England under section 109(1) and (2) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/contents" rel="external">Education and Skills Act 2008</a>. It sets out the evaluation criteria that inspectors use to make their judgements and on which they report. These include the extent to which the school meets the requirements of the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 (referred to as the independent school standards).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> It applies to school inspections under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>2.	This handbook is primarily a guide for inspectors on how to carry out non-association independent school (referred to as schools) inspections. However, we make it available to schools and other organisations to ensure that they are informed about the processes and procedures of inspection. It seeks to balance the need for consistency in inspections with the flexibility needed to respond to the individual circumstances of each school. This handbook should be regarded not as a set of inflexible rules, but as an account of the procedures of inspection. Inspectors will use their professional judgement when they use this handbook.</p>

<p>3.	The handbook has 4 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1. How schools will be inspected: this contains information about the processes before, during and after the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2. Explanation of Ofsted’s judgements: this sets out the kinds of evidence that inspectors gather and the activities they carry out to make their judgements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 3. Grade descriptors: this contains the evaluation criteria inspectors use to make the graded judgements about schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 4. Inspecting against the independent school standards and other requirements: this contains technical information about the standards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4.	This handbook applies to standard inspections. It does not cover the range of additional inspections that we carry out of independent schools: emergency, progress monitoring, pre-registration and material change inspections. Guidance on these inspections is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools">handbook for additional inspections of non-association independent schools</a>.</p>

<p>5.	This handbook also applies in the event that the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) commissions Ofsted to carry out a standard inspection of an independent school that is normally inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-independent-schools">‘Memorandum of understanding between Ofsted and <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>: independent schools’</a>). In this event, the school will be added to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://parentview.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">Ofsted Parent View</a>, our online survey for parents, for the duration of the on-site inspection.</p>

<p>6.	In May 2022, the government introduced a draft bill proposing changes to the regulation of independent schools. We will update this handbook as necessary in response to this legislation.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Gathering personal information on inspection</h3>

<p>7.	Inspectors will gather any personal information necessary to assist them in inspecting a school. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/schools-ofsted-privacy-notice">Our privacy policy</a> sets out what personal information we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it and individuals’ rights under data protection legislation.</p>

<p>8.	Individuals and organisations are legally required to provide inspectors with access to information. Section 110 of The Education and Skills Act 2008 gives inspectors a right to inspect and take copies of any records kept by the school, and any other documents containing information relating to the school, that are required for the purposes of the inspection. These powers enable inspectors to look at computers and other devices that may hold relevant information. Regulations enable the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to provide Ofsted with information on individual pupils where it relates to school inspections.</p>

<p>9.	Paragraph 32(1)(g) of the independent school standards requires proprietors to provide any information reasonably requested in connection with an inspection under section 109 of The Education and Skills Act 2008 which is required for the purposes of the inspection to the body carrying out the inspection, and to give that body access to the school’s admission and attendance registers.</p>

<p>10.	Inspectors gather evidence on inspection and record this on Ofsted’s systems. They may also see evidence on site that contains personal information about staff and young people, such as registers and lesson plans. Inspectors may take notes from, or copies of, this type of evidence before handing it back to an appropriate staff member at the end of the inspection. Any notes or copies will be stored as evidence securely and not retained by inspectors personally. Inspectors may take photographs of pupils’ work. These photographs will be stored securely as evidence, but will not be retained by the inspector personally.</p>

<p>11.	In most schools, inspectors will gather evidence electronically using a range of devices, including laptops, mobile telephones and tablets. Inspectors should transfer evidence securely in line with our security policies.</p>

<h3>Research on inspection</h3>

<p>12.	We may carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/research">research</a> during our inspections. Where this happens, the research activity will have no impact on inspection judgements. As our research work is based on our national priorities, we may invite providers to participate in research visits at other times.</p>

<h2>Clarification for schools</h2>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>13.	In this handbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the term ‘proprietor’ includes where the proprietor is an individual and where there is a proprietor body</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to parents includes registered parents or carers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to ‘report’ describes the formal written outcome of the inspection, which is usually published</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Common misconceptions about inspection</h3>

<p>14.	The information below confirms our requirements. This is to correct common misconceptions about inspection that can result in unnecessary workload for schools. It is intended to highlight specific practices that we do not require.</p>

<h4>Evidence for inspection</h4>

<p>15.	We do not require schools to do additional work or to ask pupils to do work specifically for the inspection, or create unnecessary workload for teachers through our recommendations.</p>

<p>16.	We will not require schools to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence for inspection beyond that set out in this handbook</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence in any specific format, as long as it is easily accessible for inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>written evidence of oral feedback to pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>predictions of attainment and progress scores</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assessment or self-evaluation, other than that which is already part of the school’s business processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>performance and pupil-tracking information</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Involving leaders and governance in inspections</h4>

<p>17.	We will invite the headteacher (or equivalent) and the proprietor(s) to observe the inspectors’ final team meeting.</p>

<p>18.	We will expect the proprietor(s) and the person(s) responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school to be present during the inspection. Without meeting these individuals, inspectors may not be able to gather sufficient evidence in order to judge whether the school meets paragraph 34(1) of the independent school standards, which concerns the quality of leadership and management.</p>

<p>19.	We will encourage the school to invite as many governors and as many members of the proprietor body as possible to meet inspectors during an inspection, as observers. These meetings may include a virtual option using video or telephone calls if necessary.</p>

<h4>Evaluating the quality of education</h4>

<p>20.	We will judge fairly schools that take radically different approaches to the curriculum; inspectors will assess any school’s curriculum favourably when leaders have built or adopted a curriculum with appropriate coverage, content, structure and sequencing and implemented it effectively.</p>

<p>21.	We will not look unfavourably on schools that have adopted curriculum sequences created by others, for example commercial or local schemes. We will look at whatever curriculum the school is using. It is up to schools to determine their practices and it is up to leadership teams to justify these on their own merits rather than referring to this handbook.</p>

<p>22.	We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grade individual lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advocate a particular method of planning (including lesson planning), teaching or assessment, or expect curriculum planning to be in any specific format</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to provide individual lesson plans or previous lesson plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to provide recordings of live lessons that are delivered remotely, unless they are normally stored for staff or pupils’ future use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to carry out a specified amount of lesson observation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take a random sample of exercise books/folders/sketchbooks/electronic files or evaluate individual workbooks or expect workbooks to be compiled solely to provide evidence for inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use work scrutiny to evaluate teachers’ marking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>specify the frequency, type or volume of marking and feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to ensure a particular frequency or quantity of work in pupils’ books or folders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require photographic evidence of pupils’ work (although inspectors may ask to take photographs themselves of pupils’ work, and will take all reasonable steps to anonymise these)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Staff information and professional development</h4>

<p>23.	We will not provide schools with any information from any lesson visit with the intention that it be used in capability or disciplinary proceedings or for the purposes of performance management.</p>

<p>24.	We will not routinely check personnel files, although inspectors may look at a small sample.</p>

<p>25.	We will not require schools to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence of the monitoring of teaching, teachers’ professional development or application of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>, other than that which is already part of the school’s normal activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence about each teacher from each of the bulleted sub-headings in the teachers’ standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide specific details of the pay grade of individual teachers who are observed during inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide anonymised lists of teachers who meet or do not meet performance thresholds for pay progression</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide processes for the performance management arrangements for school leaders and staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> to grade teaching or individual lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include targets relating to the proportion of good or better teaching in the headteacher’s objectives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set teachers’ performance targets based on commercially produced predictions of pupils’ achievement, or any other data set, from which it would then hold teachers to account</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safeguarding and security</h4>

<p>26.	We expect schools to maintain, as they are required to, a single central record of the safeguarding checks they carry out.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>27.	We do not expect, and there is no requirement for, schools to apply retrospectively for Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) and other pre-employment checks for staff who were appointed before <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> requirements were introduced, and have been employed continuously since then.</p>

<p>28.	We do not require schools to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take any specific set of steps with regard to site security; in particular, inspectors do not have a view about the need for perimeter fences or lockdown alarms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use a digital platform to monitor pupils’ internet use, and we do not specify how these platforms should operate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Independent school standards</h4>

<p>29.	We will expect the school to provide all policies, schemes of work and plans and all other documents required by the independent school standards in English.</p>

<p>30.	We will report on any failure to comply with the independent school standards.</p>

<h2>Part 1. How schools will be inspected</h2>

<h2>Basics of inspection</h2>

<h3>How schools are selected for inspection</h3>

<p>31.	All independent schools are inspected at the direction of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, which is the registration authority for independent schools. Therefore, Ofsted may be asked to inspect an independent school at any time. This might occur, for example, where the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has particular concerns about a school.</p>

<p>32.	The <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> and this handbook set out the arrangements for standard inspections of independent schools carried out under section 109(1) and (2) of the Education and Skills Act 2008.</p>

<p>33.	For details on aligned inspections of boarding or residential special schools, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#part-3">‘Part 3. Applying the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> in different contexts’</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>34.	All schools have a unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>). Any institution with its own <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> that we inspect will receive an inspection report after each inspection.</p>

<h3>Frequency of inspections<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>
</h3>

<p>35.	A 3-year cycle of standard inspections began in September 2018.</p>

<p>36.	Schools that are judged as requires improvement or inadequate normally have a standard inspection within 2 years of the previous standard inspection.</p>

<p>37.	The inspection cycle for all non-association independent schools will be extended by 4 terms to take account of the temporary suspension of routine inspections owing to COVID-19. Therefore, inspections within the current cycle will not reflect the timescales published above. The next 3-year cycle of standard inspections will begin in January 2023.</p>

<p>38.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may commission Ofsted to carry out a progress monitoring inspection when a school has failed to meet all of the independent school standards. Therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all schools that are judged to be inadequate normally receive a progress monitoring inspection before their next standard inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>schools that are judged as requires improvement following a standard inspection may also receive a progress monitoring inspection before their next standard inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>39.	The purpose of the progress monitoring inspection is for inspectors to judge whether the school has addressed any unmet independent school standards and any other issues identified at the previous standard inspection.</p>

<p>40.	On a progress monitoring inspection of a school that was judged as requires improvement but met all the independent school standards, inspectors will judge whether the school continues to comply with the standards relating to any qualitative issues that may have been identified at the previous standard inspection.</p>

<p>41.	Guidance on progress monitoring inspections is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools">handbook for additional inspections of independent schools</a>.</p>

<h3>Bringing forward standard inspections following additional inspections</h3>

<p>42.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may bring forward a school’s next standard inspection following an additional inspection in order to update the school’s graded judgements.</p>

<p>43.	There are 2 scenarios when this may happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a school that was graded requires improvement or inadequate has now been judged to have significantly improved at a progress monitoring inspection and now meets all of its previously failed independent school standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a good or outstanding school is judged to no longer meet the independent school standards at either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>an emergency inspection</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a material change inspection, where the school has already implemented the change before getting approval from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>44.	In the first scenario, the lead inspector of that progress monitoring inspection must have judged that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>all the previously unmet standards are now being met securely and consistently</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school is likely to be able to provide evidence that it can meet part 8 of the standards (leadership and management) on a standard inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any qualitative issues identified at the previous inspection have been rectified and solutions embedded so that the school stands a reasonable chance of being judged good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum development is at a stage where it is likely to be judged favourably under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Carrying out additional inspections as part of a standard inspection</h3>

<p>45.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may commission Ofsted to carry out an additional inspection as part of a standard inspection. It may commission Ofsted to consider a school’s application to make a material change to its registration, a school’s progress in implementing its action plan and in meeting unmet independent school standards, or issues raised by a complaint or other issue about a school, as part of a standard inspection. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will request this in an inspection commissioning form.</p>

<p>46.	Similarly, if the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> commissions Ofsted to carry out an additional inspection and a standard inspection is already scheduled to take place in the same or next term, Ofsted may recommend to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> that the additional inspection be carried out as part of the standard inspection.</p>

<p>47.	In both cases, the ‘additional matters’ will normally be considered as part of the standard inspection in a single inspection. Ofsted will typically report on the ‘additional matters’ to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> in the report for the standard inspection and complete one independent school standards compliance record. The report will clearly set out the legislative basis for both inspection types and the reason for the additional inspection. The report will be published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">our reports website</a>. However, there may be occasions – such as when a progress monitoring inspection is commissioned with a standard inspection – when 2 reports are written and published on our website. This is in order to ensure that the progress against previously unmet standards is reported clearly to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>New schools</h3>

<p>48.	Proprietors who want to open a new school must apply to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> for registration. They are asked to supply the information set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/section/98" rel="external">section 98 of the Education and Skills Act 2008</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/901/contents/made" rel="external">Independent Educational Provision in England (Provision of Information) and Non-Maintained Special Schools (England) and Independent School Standards (Amendment) Regulations 2018</a>.</p>

<p>49.	The Education and Skills Act 2008 requires Ofsted to carry out a pre-registration inspection of a prospective school before it opens, when commissioned to do so by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. Inspectors consider the written evidence supplied in the school’s application to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> before the pre-registration inspection is made to the school to advise the Secretary of State about the school’s readiness for registration. Schools must not begin operating until they are registered (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-school-registration">‘Independent school registration’</a>). Following a pre-registration inspection, the inspector reports to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> about the extent to which the independent school standards are likely to be met. From the summer term 2018, these reports have been published on our website and made available to the school. The decision on whether or not to register the school lies with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>50.	Once registered, new schools receive their first standard inspection in their first year of operation. These reports are also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">published on our reports website</a>.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<h3>When can an inspection take place?</h3>

<p>51.	An inspection can take place at any point from 5 school days after the first day pupils attend in the autumn term. For example, if pupils return to school on a Wednesday, an inspection can take place as early as the following Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Schools requesting an inspection</h3>

<p>52.	Unlike other schools inspected under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>, independent schools are not able to request an inspection outside of the usual inspection cycle, as set out above.</p>

<h3>Inspection fees</h3>

<p>53.	Schools are charged a fee for standard, pre-registration and progress monitoring inspections. The fees for pre-registration and progress monitoring inspections are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/995/contents/made" rel="external">Independent Educational Provision in England (Inspection Fees and Savings Provisions) Regulations 2019</a>.</p>

<p>54.	For standard inspections, 2 sets of fees regulations are currently in force. Depending on the timing of their most recent standard inspection, schools are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>still being charged under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/205/regulation/1/made" rel="external">The Independent Educational Provision in England (Inspection Fees) and Independent School Standards (Amendment) Regulations 2018</a>, which came into force on 1 April 2018</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>charged under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/995/contents/made" rel="external">The Independent Educational Provision in England (Inspection Fees and Savings Provisions) Regulations 2019</a>, which came into force on 1 July 2019</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>55.	An inspection fee will always be charged unless a deferral is granted in line with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deferring-ofsted-inspections">deferral policy</a> before the start of on-site inspection activity. If the inspection is rescheduled to take place at another time, a fee will be payable once the inspection has taken place.</p>

<p>56.	In the case of pre-registration inspections, where a proposed school withdraws its application at or following notification, the fee will still be payable.</p>

<h3>Provision for 2- and 3-year-olds</h3>

<p>57.	Schools that take 2- and 3-year-olds as part of their early years provision may not need to register that provision with Ofsted. In these cases, we will inspect provision for 2- and 3-year-olds as part of a standard inspection and inspectors will ensure that the judgement on the effectiveness of early years provision includes an evaluation of the provision for 2- and 3-year-olds. Inspectors will also note if any children receive additional funding.</p>

<p>58.	Any care that a school provides for children in the early years age range, before and/or after the school day or during the school holidays is considered as part of the evaluation of the early years provision in the standard inspection.</p>

<h3>Inspections of boarding and residential special schools</h3>

<p>59.	When boarding provision in boarding schools has been judged inadequate or requires improvement, it is inspected again within 2 years. Where the boarding provision has been judged good or outstanding, it will be inspected within 3 years. Residential provision in residential special schools is inspected annually. We may inspect the boarding or residential provision sooner, for instance if we have a cause for concern, or at the request of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<p>60.	When a boarding or residential special school’s standard inspection is due in the same financial year as the full inspection of its boarding or residential provision, we will normally carry out an aligned inspection.</p>

<p>61.	We will continue to carry out integrated additional inspections of independent schools when the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> commissions us to do so and in line with the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools">handbook for additional inspections</a>.</p>

<p>62.	Aligned inspections are carried out by 2 separate inspection teams (education and social care). They result in 2 sets of graded judgements and 2 separate published reports. We will also publish on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a> a summary letter using extracts from both reports.</p>

<p>63.	We make the judgements for boarding or residential provision in accordance with the guidance and grade descriptors in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif-boarding-schools-and-residential-special-schools">social care common inspection framework (SCCIF): boarding schools and residential special schools</a>. We carry out the inspection of the education provision under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>64.	Education inspectors will consider the impact of the boarding/residential judgements on the overall effectiveness judgement for the whole school. They will take account of the proportion of boarders/residential pupils who also attend the school and the seriousness of any issues found.</p>

<p>65.	In practice, inspectors from both teams will work closely together to plan the inspection activities. They will discuss their findings throughout the inspections. They will normally carry out meetings with key personnel, such as the safeguarding lead(s) and the proprietor, together. The 2 teams will share inspection evidence where it is appropriate to do so, for example in assessing the strengths of the links between the day school and the boarding provision.</p>

<p>66.	We will notify the provider of the aligned inspections at around 2pm on the day before both inspections are due to start. The lead education and social care inspectors will then follow this notification call with separate calls to the headteacher and head of boarding, respectively. All inspectors will arrive on site at the same time.</p>

<h3>Inspections of schools that are registered as children’s homes</h3>

<p>67.	The inspection of education in a school that is also registered as a children’s home may take place as a stand-alone inspection of the education provision or at the same time as the full inspection of the children’s home. When possible, we will attempt to carry out both inspections at the same time so that inspectors may work together and share evidence.</p>

<p>68.	When the education inspection takes place as a stand-alone event, inspectors must read the most recent education and children’s home reports on the preparation day. They must make themselves aware of any current issues concerning children’s welfare that may affect aspects of the school inspection. Inspectors will ensure that they take these into consideration during the inspection.</p>

<h2>Before the inspection</h2>

<h3>Notification and lead inspector’s preparation</h3>

<h4>Notification</h4>

<p>69.	We will normally contact the school by telephone to announce the inspection around lunchtime on the day before the inspection is due to start.</p>

<p>70.	By exception, we may carry out an inspection without notice, for example at the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s request.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup> When this happens, we will not telephone the school before the inspection.</p>

<p>71.	If the headteacher is unavailable when the notification call is made, we will ask to speak to the most senior member of staff available. Once we have informed the school by telephone that the inspection will take place, we will send confirmation to the school by email.</p>

<p>72.	During the initial notification phone call, we will ask the school to confirm the information we hold about the provision. This will include the number of pupils on roll at the school, the governance arrangements for the school and whether the school has any special educational needs and/or disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>) provision, alternative provision, nursery provision for 2- and 3-year-olds or additional resource provision.</p>

<p>73.	We will also make clear that the inspectors will expect the proprietor(s) and the person(s) responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school to be present during the inspection. This is because inspectors will expect to interview them to judge their ability to promote and implement the relevant policies and procedures.</p>

<p>74.	We will then send the school a letter setting out key information for leaders to be aware of before the inspection. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ofsted’s privacy notice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing the school that inspectors will use a range of technology to gather evidence electronically</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing the school that inspectors may request to take photographic evidence, for example of pupils’ work and displays, but that inspectors will not take photographs of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#required-information">information that the school will need to make available to inspectors</a> at the start of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the links to pupil and staff questionnaires, so they can be shared</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Schools that appear to no longer be operating</h4>

<p>75.	On the rare occasion that it appears that a school is no longer operating, we will check whether the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> requires an inspection to be carried out to check whether the school is still operating. If the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> requires such an inspection, the standard inspection will normally be changed to an emergency inspection. The emergency inspection will be carried out in line with the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools">handbook for additional inspections of independent schools</a>.</p>

<h4>Requests for deferral or cancellation</h4>

<p>76.	A school may request a deferral of its inspection. It may make a request to the inspection support administrator during the initial notification phone call, or to the lead inspector on the day it is notified of the inspection. We will not normally consider requests for deferrals if we receive them after 4.30pm on the day the school is notified. The inspection support administrator or lead inspector must immediately contact the regional duty desk. We will decide whether to grant a deferral in accordance with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deferring-ofsted-inspections">deferral policy</a>.</p>

<p>77.	Normally, if the school is providing education to pupils, an inspection will go ahead. In exceptional circumstances, however, an inspection might be cancelled or deferred after the school has been notified, following a request made by the school. We will aim to let the school know whether a request is granted on the same day it is made, but in some cases (particularly when the request for deferral comes later), this may happen by 8am the next morning.</p>

<p>78.	The deferral policy makes clear that, where a school requests a deferral of its inspection because there are no pupils on roll, and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> is already taking regulatory or enforcement action against the school, we will not agree to defer the inspection on these grounds alone. In addition, when the standard inspection of a school has already been deferred once because there were no pupils on roll, we will not defer the inspection for a second time solely on the same grounds.</p>

<p>79.	If a school is within 6 months of confirmed closure, the inspection will normally still go ahead. We will inform the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> of the timescale in which the school expects to close.</p>

<p>80.	If a school states that it has already closed or that it is no longer operating as a school, we will consult the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may commission Ofsted to carry out an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools/handbook-for-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools-for-september-2022#emergency-inspections-of-schools-that-appear-to-have-closed">emergency inspection</a> to check compliance with the independent school standards instead of a standard inspection.</p>

<p>81.	In the case of an inspection without notice, any requests for a deferral will be passed to Ofsted’s relevant regional director, who will decide whether the request can be granted.</p>

<p>82.	We will always inform the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> if we grant a deferral of any type of independent school inspection. Where we believe that an inspection of an independent school should be cancelled, we will invite the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> to withdraw the inspection commission.</p>

<h3>Preparation carried out by the lead inspector</h3>

<p>83.	Inspectors will review and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>other policies (for example, on behaviour, and relationships, sex and health education)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>curriculum information (so the lead inspector can start to assess the breadth and balance of the school’s curriculum and whether it is likely to promote preparation for, and an appreciation of, life in modern Britain)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>information about governance</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information provided by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, in particular any specific focus for the inspection, in the inspection commissioning form, where the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has commissioned:<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the inspection to be brought forward</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any complaints from parents or members of the public that the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has asked Ofsted to consider as part of the inspection<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s census returns</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from any other associated providers (which will be triangulated with evidence gathered during the inspection): this may include registered early years provision or, if the school is part of a chain of independent schools, any relevant information from recent inspections of these schools, such as any reported evidence about the suitability and capability of the proprietor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other information publicly available or available from relevant stakeholders such as local authorities and the police</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>84.	The lead inspector will also check compliance with aspects of the independent school standards where that is possible before arriving on site (such as in relation to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3283/schedule/made" rel="external">part 6 of the standards, ‘provision of information’</a>.</p>

<p>85.	The lead inspector will find out the identity of the school’s proprietor before the inspection starts. They will check whether the proprietor’s identity is recorded consistently in the previous inspection report, the current ‘Get information about schools’ record for the school, the school’s last census returns and the school’s website, if one exists (this may have a section that describes governance arrangements). Any discrepancies between ‘Get information about schools’ and other sources will be recorded on an evidence card and followed up on inspection.</p>

<p>86.	If a registered school has moved its main or sole site to a different local authority area, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s policy is that the school will not be treated as a new entity. However, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will change the school’s registration number, and consequently the school’s <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>. Therefore, the lead inspector will refer to the inspection history relating to the school’s previous registration.</p>

<p>87.	Other relevant information may be in the public domain and reported in the press. Inspectors will therefore conduct a brief internet search as part of their pre-inspection planning to see whether there are any safeguarding or other issues, such as a change of governance, that may need to be followed up during inspection.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Preparatory telephone call(s) from the lead inspector to the headteacher</h3>

<p>88.	In announced inspections, the lead inspector will contact the school and ask to speak to the headteacher. This will normally be later on in the afternoon following the inspection support administrator’s initial notification call.</p>

<p>89.	Inspectors’ preparatory telephone conversations with headteachers will have 2 elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a short inspection-planning conversation that focuses on practical and logistical issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a longer, reflective, educationally focused conversation about the school’s progress since the last inspection, including how COVID-19 has affected this</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>90.	It may be that both these elements are discussed in a single telephone conversation. Alternatively, they may be carried out as 2 or more separate conversations with a break in between, as agreed between the lead inspector and the headteacher.</p>

<h4>Inspection planning conversation</h4>

<p>91.	This conversation will be short and focused on practical issues. The lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>inform the headteacher of the time during the afternoon of the next day that the inspection will start</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make the school aware of the need to inform parents of the inspection, and that Ofsted’s Parent View is the main method for gathering parents’ views at the point of inspection; inspectors will remind the school that Ofsted’s letter to parents containing the link to Ofsted Parent View may be sent electronically, or a paper copy may be given to pupils to take home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss the nature of any <a class="govuk-link" href="###Provision%20for%20children%20with%20SEND"><abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> provision</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss any nursery provision (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#2-and-3-year-olds">‘Provision for 2- and 3-year-olds’</a> section, before- and/or after-school care and holiday clubs led and managed directly by the school, particularly if these take <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/factsheet-childcare-registering-school-based-provision">2- to 8-year-olds</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish whether the school operates from more than one site, for example if it offers early years or sixth-form provision on separate premises; inspectors must establish the full address of each site, record this on an evidence card and report it to the relevant Senior HMI</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish whether the school is linked to a children’s home, and if so whether the children’s home is managed by the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clarify whether the school has boarding or residential provision, and if so the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>number of boarding houses or residential units and their addresses</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the number of boarders or residential pupils on roll</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>invite the headteacher and other senior leaders, as agreed by the lead inspector and headteacher, to take part in joint visits to lessons and to observe the main inspection team meetings</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish whether the school offers statutory induction of <a class="govuk-link" href="#early-career-teachers">early career teachers</a> (<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make arrangements for meetings with relevant staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the identity of the individual proprietor or proprietor body of the school, arrange an appropriate time to speak to them during the inspection, and invite as many members of the proprietor body as possible to attend the final feedback meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish what the governance structure of the school is, and make arrangements for a meeting with the chair of governors and as many governors as possible (and/or representatives of those responsible for governance). Inspectors will request that as many governors as possible are also present at the final feedback meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish how the school will give the lead inspector access to its policy documents and records so that inspectors can check the school’s compliance with the independent school standards. We expect all documents to be provided in English</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide an opportunity for the school to ask any questions or to raise any concerns, such as perceived conflicts of interest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where there are children or staff who are particularly at risk from COVID-19, agree safety protocols that the inspection team will follow. Inspectors will follow the latest guidance on testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree whether it may be pragmatic to do some elements of the inspection through video or telephone calls. This will usually only be to involve parents and those with leadership or governance responsibility who are unable to attend</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>let the school know if and when <a class="govuk-link" href="###The%20role%20of%20an%20interpreter%20during%20inspection">interpreters</a> will be present during the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that the school is <strong>not</strong> requesting a deferral</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>92.	The lead inspector will also use the discussion to establish whether the school has any pupils who attend off-site alternative provision, either full time or part time, run either by the school or in partnership with other schools. If the school uses off-site alternative provision, the lead inspector will request further details about this.</p>

<p>93.	The lead inspector will also request that the school provides certain information <strong>as early as possible</strong> to aid preparation. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a copy of the school timetable(s), where relevant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of any relevant staff absence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether any teachers cannot be observed for any reason (for example, if they are subject to capability procedures)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>94.	If any issues arise, the lead inspector may also need further clarification from the school, for example when information is not available on the school’s website.</p>

<h3>The educationally focused conversation</h3>

<p>95.	Inspectors will use this conversation to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s context, and the progress it has made since the previous inspection, including any specific progress made on areas for improvement identified at previous inspections that remain relevant under the current inspection framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the specific impact of COVID-19 on the school and how the school’s leaders are responding to the ongoing impact. We recognise that responding to COVID-19 has placed great demands on school leaders and detailed discussions of the COVID-19 pandemic may be required to understand the school’s context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher’s assessment of the school’s current strengths and weaknesses, particularly in relation to: the curriculum, the way teaching supports pupils to learn the curriculum, the standards pupils achieve, pupils’ behaviour and attitudes, and the personal development of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the specific areas of the school curriculum that should be focused on during inspection – during this call, inspectors will also agree with the headteacher which subjects will receive a deep dive during the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>96.	This conversation will normally last up to 90 minutes, but may be longer. It will help inspectors and school leaders to establish a rapport before inspection and give them a shared understanding of the starting point of the inspection. It will also help inspectors to form an initial understanding of leaders’ views of the school’s progress.</p>

<p>97.	This conversation will be used to agree the inspection plan with the headteacher.</p>

<h4>Provision for children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>
</h4>

<p>98.	If the school has provision for children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, during the educationally focused conversation with the school, the lead inspector will ask the headteacher to clarify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and the range of their needs, together with pupils’ timetables</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the type(s) of language or communication systems used. If there is specialist provision for deaf pupils and British Sign Language is used, the lead inspector will establish whether a British Sign Language interpreter will be provided by the school when inspectors are meeting with the pupils. The lead inspector will contact the inspection support administrator as soon as possible if an <a class="govuk-link" href="###The%20role%20of%20an%20interpreter%20during%20inspection">interpreter</a> is needed. Details will be available in the team room</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staffing arrangements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information that schools must provide by the start of the inspection</h3>

<p>99.	The inspection support administrator will also send the school a letter setting out that the following information must be made available to inspectors at the formal start of the inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the policies and other documents required by the independent school standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strategic documents about the school, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>anything that sets out school improvement planning or the longer-term vision for the school, such as the school’s strategy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a summary of any school self-evaluation and/or improvement plan or equivalent</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>any reports from any external evaluation of the school</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>documented evidence of the work of the proprietor and/or those responsible for governance and their priorities</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>records and data about behaviour and attendance, including</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>up-to-date attendance analysis for all groups of pupils</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of pupils taken off roll</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of exclusions and suspensions, incidents of poor behaviour and any use of internal isolation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of bullying, discriminatory and prejudiced behaviour, either directly or indirectly, including racist, sexist, disability and homophobic/biphobic/transphobic bullying, use of derogatory language and racist incidents</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of sexual harassment or sexual violence</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>operational documents, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>access to wifi, if it exists, so that inspectors can connect to the internet</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>maps and other practical information</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the school timetable, current staff list (indicating <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england"><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a>) and times for the school day, including planned interruptions to normal school routines during the inspection</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>class lists showing pupils’ names and year groups</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safeguarding information</h4>

<p>100.	On arrival at the school, inspectors must have secure access to safeguarding information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the single central record for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of referrals made to the designated person for safeguarding in the school and those that were subsequently referred to the local authority, along with brief details of the resolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of all pupils who have open cases with children’s services or social care and all pupils who have a multi-agency plan</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>101.	Schools and inspectors must ensure that all actions are compliant with legal requirements on information-handling.</p>

<h3>Seeking the views of parents, staff and pupils</h3>

<h4>Seeking the views of parents</h4>

<p>102.	We will provide schools with a letter to pass on to parents that formally notifies them of a standard inspection. This letter explains how to use Ofsted Parent View and how parents can contact inspectors. Schools should encourage parents to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://parentview.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">Ofsted Parent View questionnaire</a> by placing a link to it on their website. In addition, inspectors will encourage the school to notify parents using its own electronic systems (such as text messages), where these are available.</p>

<p>103.	Inspectors will review the evidence from Ofsted Parent View throughout the inspection to ensure that all online responses received during the inspection are taken into account. If the response rate for Ofsted Parent View is low, inspectors may take steps during the inspection to gather further evidence of parents’ views.</p>

<p>104.	Inspectors will also take into account any other evidence from parents, including the results of any past surveys the school has carried out or commissioned. If individual parents raise serious issues, inspectors should follow these up with the school and record its response.</p>

<p>105.	During aligned inspections of boarding or residential special schools, inspectors will take account of the views that parents have given on Ofsted Parent View about the school’s boarding or residential provision. They will also take account of the views of children and young people who are boarders or residential pupils, and those of boarding staff, which will have been gathered through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-online-questionnaires-guidance-for-providers">Ofsted’s annual point-in-time surveys</a>.</p>

<h4>Pupil and staff questionnaires</h4>

<p>106.	The views of pupils and staff in schools are gathered through online questionnaires. The inspection support administrator sends online links to the school with the formal notification of inspection. The school is asked to encourage staff and pupils to complete the online questionnaires. Pupils and staff should complete their questionnaire by midday on the final on-site day of the inspection.</p>

<p>107.	Inspectors may also gather evidence from pupils, parents (or other stakeholders) in person. This may include informal meetings at the start and/or end of the day. These meetings must take place without the presence of the headteacher or senior staff. In drawing on evidence from these meetings, every attempt must be made to protect the identity of individuals. There may be circumstances, however, in which it is not possible to guarantee the anonymity of the interviewee. Inspectors have a duty to pass on disclosures that raise child protection or safeguarding issues and/or where there are concerns about serious misconduct, bullying of staff or criminal activity.</p>

<h2>The inspection</h2>

<h3>Timetable of inspection and inspection team members</h3>

<p>108.	Standard inspections do not normally last longer than 3 days. Usually, the lead inspector will begin the inspection on the afternoon after the initial notification call. The size of the inspection team will vary according to the size and nature of the school. Any team inspectors will normally join the inspection for the second and third full days.</p>

<p>109.	On the first day of the inspection, inspectors will not normally arrive before 12pm. On the second and third days, inspectors will not arrive before 8am. Inspectors will usually leave by 6pm on all on-site days.</p>

<p>110.	On aligned inspections of boarding and residential special schools, the social care regulatory inspectors may stay into the evening to ensure that they are able to meet boarding or residential pupils and see the boarding or residential provision operating. How long they stay will depend on their lines of enquiry.</p>

<p>111.	There is no requirement to deploy inspectors of a particular faith to inspect a school of the same faith. It would be unusual for an inspection team of a faith school to consist entirely of inspectors of that faith.</p>

<h3>The role of an interpreter during inspection</h3>

<p>112.	Interpreters support inspections of schools that teach some or all of their curriculum in a language other than English. This ensures that inspectors are able to consider the school’s evidence about how its curriculum and overall education meets the criteria set out. Please note that this does not apply to those schools that teach languages, for example French or Latin, to pupils; interpreters will only be used to support inspections where subjects other than languages themselves are taught in another language.</p>

<p>113.	Interpreters may support inspectors by interpreting what is said or written, but they will not contribute to the inspection judgements made about the school or decisions about whether the school complies with the independent school standards.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup></p>

<p>114.	Interpreters may be present for the entire duration of the inspection, or for only part of it, depending on how the school’s provision is arranged. This will normally be confirmed during the lead inspector’s initial telephone call to the school if appropriate.</p>

<p>115.	Interpreters may accompany an inspector during any inspection activity. This could include, but is not limited to, visits to lessons; speaking to pupils, teachers, parents, governors and headteachers; looking at pupils’ work; and reviewing curriculum materials, including schemes of work. The interpreter will take notes, which will be retained by the lead inspector and added to the evidence base.</p>

<h3>Inspection methodology</h3>

<p>116.	Our framework puts a single, joined-up conversation about education at the heart of inspection, using a 3-part methodology to inspect schools on standard inspections. Through this methodology, inspectors build a view of the quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development and leadership and management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>from their pre-inspection preparation and the educationally focused conversation with the headteacher, inspectors will form a <strong>top-level view</strong> – an initial understanding of the curriculum, the way teaching supports pupils to learn the curriculum, the standards pupils achieve, pupils’ behaviour and attitudes, and the personal development of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inspectors will then <strong>collect and connect</strong> evidence for each of the judgement areas throughout the on-site part of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>towards the end of each day, inspectors will then <strong>bring all the evidence together</strong> to draw the conclusions that will inform their final judgements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>117.	Inspectors’ priority during inspections is to collect first-hand evidence.</p>

<h4>Keeping leaders informed</h4>

<p>118.	The lead inspector will meet the headteacher regularly throughout the inspection to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide updates on emerging issues, including initial general findings about the quality of education, and to enable further evidence to be provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow the headteacher to raise concerns, including those related to the conduct of the inspection or of individual inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alert the headteacher to any serious concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>119.	If there is evidence that the school might be judged as inadequate or requires improvement, the lead inspector will alert the headteacher to this possibility. The inspector must emphasise that they do not make final judgements until the final team meeting at the end of the last on-site day.</p>

<h4>Early career teachers</h4>

<p>120.	Inspectors will meet <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> where possible and may wish to visit lessons given by <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>. When the lead inspector requests a copy of the current staff list, they must ask whether it includes any <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and/or any trainees on placement, including those on School Direct or School Direct (salaried) training routes.</p>

<p>121.	Inspectors will take into account the fact that <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> have less experience than other teachers. However, they must assess the effectiveness of the support and professional development put in place for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> – whether or not the school has chosen to offer <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview">statutory induction</a> – to ensure that <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach in their chosen subject or phase.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">[footnote 15]</a></sup></p>

<p>122.	Inspectors should also gather <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>’ views on how the school is supporting their development, including the quality of their mentoring and how the school ensures that they access their entitlement to training under the ECF. Inspectors will also discuss how the school supports <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> in managing pupils’ behaviour.</p>

<p>123.	Inspectors will meet with mentors and, where possible, the induction tutor. Inspectors will meet any trainees employed by the school on the School Direct (salaried) route to assess their support, mentoring and induction. Inspectors will not visit lessons given by trainees.</p>

<p>124.	Inspectors will not visit lessons given by trainees. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a> state that providers will assess trainees against the standards in a way that is consistent with what could reasonably be expected of a trainee teacher before the awarding of qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>). Inspectors will not take trainees’ performance into account when assessing the quality of education.</p>

<h3>Meeting the proprietor and those responsible for governance</h3>

<p>125.	Inspectors will want to meet with the proprietor(s) and the person(s) responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school during the inspection. The purpose of this is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proprietor’s work in monitoring how leaders at the school ensure that all the independent school standards are met. Without meeting these individuals, inspectors may not be able to gather sufficient evidence to judge whether the school meets paragraph 34(1) of the standards, which concerns the quality of leadership and management.</p>

<p>126.	Inspectors will also want to meet with governors (if the school has them) during the inspection.</p>

<p>127.	The role that proprietors and governors play in the school’s performance is evaluated as part of the judgement on the effectiveness of leadership and management. Reports will often contain a separate paragraph that addresses the governance of the school.</p>

<p>128.	As with meetings with pupils, parents, <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and staff, meetings or telephone discussions with those responsible for governance should take place without the headteacher or other senior staff being present.</p>

<h3>Other evidence</h3>

<p>129.	Inspectors will also scrutinise a range of school records, documentation and information relating to, for example, pupils’ behaviour, attendance and safeguarding.</p>

<p>130.	We may use the evidence that inspectors gather during standard inspections to inform other work, such as national reporting, for example our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsted-education-recovery-series">education recovery series</a>.</p>

<h3>Considering complaints as part of the inspection</h3>

<p>131.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> is responsible for investigating complaints about independent schools. We do not investigate complaints about independent schools, but the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may commission us to carry out an emergency inspection or bring forward the school’s next standard inspection as a result of a complaint. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may also ask us to consider a complaint at the time of a school’s next scheduled inspection. Complaints may also form part of the information that inspectors review when they <a class="govuk-link" href="###Preparation%20carried%20out%20by%20the%20lead%20inspector">plan for any type of inspection</a>.</p>

<p>132.	If the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> commissions us to carry out or bring forward an inspection as a result of a complaint, or to consider a complaint at the time of a school’s next scheduled inspection, inspectors will consider the wider issues raised by a complaint that are relevant to the commission or to the inspection framework. When inspectors consider the wider issues raised by a complaint, they will normally report whether the school meets the independent school standards (or national minimum standards) that are relevant to these issues.</p>

<p>133.	The inspection report may reflect that the inspection was commissioned as a result of a complaint. However, reports will not refer to the substance of the complaint in case this identifies the complainant and/or any individuals in the school. If necessary, and when the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has specifically commissioned Ofsted to do so, Ofsted may use the independent school standards compliance record to confidentially share details relating to the complaint with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Inspection of the school’s approach to harmful sexual behaviour</h3>

<p>134.	During standard inspections, we will look at how leaders ensure that their school’s culture addresses harmful sexual behaviour. Inspectors will expect schools to assume that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence are happening in the community, and potentially in the school, even when there are no specific reports, and put in place a whole-school approach to address them.</p>

<p>135.	Schools should have appropriate, clear and well-communicated school-wide policies in place that make it clear that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence (including sexualised language) are unacceptable. Those policies should be consistently reflected throughout the school (see paragraphs 239, 258 and <a class="govuk-link" href="#harassment-abuse-violence">312 to 314</a>). The school’s approach will not be inspected separately, but will be considered when assessing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the curriculum in the quality of education judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour policies in the behaviour and attitudes judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pastoral support and <a class="govuk-link" href="#RSE">relationships, sex and health education</a> in the personal development judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#harassment-abuse-violence">safeguarding</a> in the leadership and management judgement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspecting schools with no pupils on roll</h3>

<p>136.	In the rare case that a school has no pupils on roll at the time of the inspection, the inspectors will carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="##The%20inspection">the inspection</a> in line with this handbook, as much as is practicable.</p>

<p>137.	As there are no pupils present, it is unlikely that inspectors will be able to gather sufficient evidence in order to make all of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> judgements, or to judge the school’s compliance with all of the independent school standards.</p>

<p>138.	Inspectors will gather as much evidence as possible in relation to the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> judgements in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="##part%202">part 2 of this handbook</a>, and about the school’s compliance with the standards. Inspectors will not base <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> judgements or judgements on whether standards are met on evidence relating to past pupils or on a prediction of what might happen if the school were to admit pupils. For example, they will not judge whether standards are likely to be met.</p>

<p>139.	As there are no pupils on roll, inspectors will not be able to make a judgement on whether safeguarding is effective or on whether the school meets the safeguarding requirements in paragraph 7 of the standards. Inspectors will also not make a judgement on compliance with standards that require effective implementation of a policy on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the curriculum (paragraph 2(1)(a))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour (paragraph 9(b))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bullying (paragraph 10)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>health and safety (paragraph 11)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first aid (paragraph 13)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>risk assessment (paragraph 16(a))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>complaints (paragraph 33)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>140.	It may also not be possible to check compliance with the requirements of the standards relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>curriculum policy, plans and schemes of work (paragraphs 2(1), 2(1)(b)(i) to 2(1)(b)(ii), 2(2)(a), 2(2)(b), 2(2)(d) to 2(2)(d)(ii), 2(2)(h), 2(2)(i))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relationships and sex education (paragraph 2A(1) to 2A(2), for example the requirement to consult parents on the policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teaching 3(a) to (j)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils (any of the paragraphs in part 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the other welfare, health and safety requirements in part 3</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The inspection report and compliance record</h3>

<p>141.	If inspectors cannot gather enough evidence to make <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> judgements or to judge whether standards are met because there are no pupils on roll, they will explain this in the inspection report. Inspectors will record ‘insufficient evidence’ against the judgements on the front cover of the report and against the relevant standards in the independent school standards compliance record.</p>

<p>142.	Inspectors will also report if there is no evidence of pupils attending in the last 3 years or if the school has no plans to admit pupils in the next 12 months. This is so that the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> can consider whether they have reasonable cause to believe that the school has ceased to be an independent educational institution and whether the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has no reasonable cause to believe the institution will become an independent educational institution again within the following 12 months. Under these circumstances, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> may decide to remove the school from the register of independent schools under section 100 of the Education and Skills Act 2008.</p>

<h3>Providing feedback</h3>

<p>143.	At the end of the final day of the inspection, inspectors will make an overall evaluation of the evidence. They will record the main points for feedback to the school in the evidence base. The on-site inspection ends with a final feedback meeting with the school. Those connected with the school who may attend include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the proprietor or, where there is a proprietor body, as many members as possible; the clerk to the proprietor body, or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher and other senior leaders, agreed by the lead inspector and headteacher</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the school has a governing body, the chair, and as many representatives as possible from the governing body; the clerk to the governing body, or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in an aligned inspection, social care regulatory inspectors and education inspectors will give feedback together to both education and residential staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>144.	Due to the diverse nature of school governance, in some schools a single individual may have more than one of the above roles.</p>

<p>145.	During this meeting, the lead inspector will ensure that the headteacher, the proprietor, those responsible for governance and all attendees are clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>about the independent school standards that are met and those that are not met</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will decide any action to take in respect of any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">standards that are not met</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the key findings from the inspection. The lead inspector must give sufficient detail to enable all attendees to understand how judgements have been reached and for those responsible for the governance of the school to play a part in planning how to tackle any areas for improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the provisional grades awarded for each key judgement and for overall effectiveness. They will also ensure that schools understand that the grades are provisional and so may be subject to change as a result of quality assurance procedures or moderation and must, therefore, be treated as restricted and confidential to the relevant senior personnel (as determined by the school). They may be shared with all of those responsible for the governance of the school irrespective of whether they attended the meeting, so long as they are clearly marked as provisional, confidential and subject to quality assurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the main findings of the inspection and the main points provided orally in the feedback meeting, subject to any change, will be referred to in the text of the report, although the text of the report may differ slightly from the oral feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about what the school needs to improve: this will appear in the inspection report as ‘What does the school need to do to improve?’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that where the school has failed to comply with the independent school standards and has been judged requires improvement or inadequate, it may receive a progress monitoring inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that, on receiving the draft report, they must ensure that the report is not shared with anyone other than those stated above, or published under any circumstances until the school receives a copy of the final inspection report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the headteacher or proprietor is invited and encouraged to complete the post-inspection survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the procedure for making a complaint about the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Inadequate schools</h3>

<p>146.	If inspectors reach the conclusion that the school’s overall effectiveness is inadequate, the lead inspector will complete ‘Form A – initial advice to the registration authority that an independent school is not complying with the independent school standards’. Ofsted will normally provide the Form A to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> soon after the inspection and before the report is finalised and published.</p>

<p>147.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will use the information to determine whether to take <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">regulatory action</a> and to prioritise those schools that require most urgent attention.</p>

<h2>After the inspection</h2>

<h3>Arrangements for publishing the report</h3>

<p>148.	The lead inspector is responsible for writing the inspection report, completing the independent school standards compliance record and submitting the evidence to Ofsted shortly after the inspection ends.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">[footnote 16]</a></sup> The text of the report should explain the judgements and reflect the evidence. The findings in the report should be consistent with the feedback given to the school at the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>149.	Where an additional inspection has formed part of the standard inspection, the outcomes will normally be included in the report and independent school standards compliance record for the standard inspection.</p>

<p>150.	Inspection reports will be quality assured before we send a draft to the school. In most circumstances, the school will receive the draft report within 18 working days after the end of the inspection. The draft report is restricted and confidential to the relevant personnel (as determined by the school), including those responsible for governance, and should not be shared more widely or published. We may also send the draft report to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and other bodies as necessary. This will only take place following moderation or quality assurance.</p>

<p>151.	The school will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report, inspection process and findings. We will consider all comments. We will respond to them when we share the final report with the school within 30 working days after the inspection.</p>

<p>152.	If the school wishes to make a formal complaint, it has 5 working days after we have shared the final report with the school (not necessarily the same as 5 school days) in which to do so. If a complaint is not submitted, we will normally publish the report on our reports website 3 working days later. If a complaint has been submitted, the publication of the report may be delayed.</p>

<p>153.	Paragraph 32(1)(d) of the schedule to the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 requires the proprietor to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that a copy of the inspection report is published and maintained on the school’s website</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide a copy of the report to the registered parents of every registered pupil at the school by the date specified by Ofsted, which is 5 working days from receipt</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>154.	The proprietor may send or give a copy of the report to parents. Alternatively, if parents have provided an email address, the school may either email an electronic copy of the report to them, or email a link to where the report is available to download from the internet.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">[footnote 17]</a></sup></p>

<p>155.	We will send the final version of the report to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> before publication  .</p>

<p>156.	In all cases, the inspection process should not be treated as complete until all inspection activity has been carried out and the final version of the inspection report has been sent to the school.</p>

<p>157.	The evidence base for the inspection must be retained in line with our retention and disposal policy. This is normally for 6 years from when the report is published. We may decide that retaining it for longer is warranted for research purposes.</p>

<h3>Suitability of the proprietor and other managers – reporting concerns to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>
</h3>

<p>158.	If inspectors identify any concerns about the suitability of the proprietor or any other member of staff employed at the school in a management capacity, these will be recorded in the independent school standards compliance record and reported to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, as the appropriate authority. This information is particularly relevant when it may have any bearing on the suitability of a person to participate in the management of an independent school. This includes when the person’s conduct undermines British values or child safety, or where the inspector has concluded that the person’s conduct is so inappropriate that it may make them unsuitable to take part in the management of an independent school.</p>

<h3>Quality assurance</h3>

<p>159.	All inspectors are responsible for the quality of their work. The lead inspector must ensure that inspections are carried out in accordance with the principles of inspection and the code of conduct.</p>

<p>160.	We monitor the quality of inspections through a range of formal processes and HMI/Senior HMI visit some providers, or monitor remotely to quality assure inspections. We may also evaluate the quality of an inspection evidence base. The lead inspector will be responsible for giving team inspectors feedback about the quality of their work and their conduct.</p>

<p>161.	All schools are invited to take part in a voluntary post-inspection survey in order to contribute to inspection development. The link to complete the survey is provided with the final copy of the school’s inspection report.</p>

<h3>Handling concerns and complaints</h3>

<p>162.	The great majority of our work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns do arise during the inspection, they should be raised with the lead inspector as soon as possible in order to resolve issues before the inspection is completed. Any concerns raised, and actions taken, will be recorded in the inspection evidence.</p>

<p>163.	If it is not possible to resolve concerns during the inspection or through submitting comments in response to the draft report, the school may wish to lodge a formal complaint on receipt of the final report. The lead inspector will ensure that the school is informed that it is able to make a formal complaint and that information about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">how to complain</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Use of Ofsted logos</h3>

<p>164.	A school judged to be outstanding or good can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://logos.ofsted.gov.uk/using-and-downloading" rel="external">use specific Ofsted logos</a> to promote its judgement, for example on its website. Schools may only use a logo when it reflects the judgement of the most recent graded inspection of that school. They must remove the logo when the school’s <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> changes, or if their grade changes. More information can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-ofsted-logos-and-copyright">our logo terms of use page</a>.</p>

<h2>Part 2. Explanation of Ofsted’s judgements</h2>

<p>165.	This section of the handbook sets out how we evaluate schools on standard inspections.</p>

<p>166.	Inspectors evaluate schools against the following key judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluating the quality of education</h2>

<h3>The curriculum</h3>

<p>167.	A school’s curriculum sets out the aims of a programme of education. It also sets out the structure for those aims to be implemented, including the knowledge and skills to be gained at each stage. It enables the school to evaluate pupils’ knowledge and skills against those expectations.</p>

<p>168.	All pupils in independent schools are entitled to receive a broad, rich curriculum – this is a requirement of paragraph 2(2)(a) of the independent school standards. Schools should therefore provide inspectors with evidence that the minimum requirements for the intended coverage and ambition of an independent school’s curriculum are met.</p>

<p>169.	All schools that include early years provision must comply with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">early years statutory framework for foundation years</a>.</p>

<p>170.	In key stage 1, pupils should be able to read, write and use mathematical knowledge, ideas and operations so that they are able to access a broad curriculum at key stage 2. Some schools are exempt from the learning and development requirements of the early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>). Where this is the case, the expectation would be that pupils are able to read and write fluently by Years 5 to 6 (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#EIF-early-reading">paragraphs 210 to 215</a>).</p>

<p>171.	In secondary education, schools need to provide a broad, rich curriculum. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hmcis-commentary-october-2017">Our research into the curriculum</a> shows that these stages are particularly susceptable to a narrow curriculum, and that this has a disproportionately negative effect on the most disadvantaged pupils. If a school has shortened key stage 3, inspectors will look for evidence that the school has made provision to ensure that pupils still have the opportunity to study a broad range of subjects in Years 7 to 9.</p>

<p>172.	All schools are also required to promote the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society; and prepare pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.</p>

<p>173.	If remote education is in place, schools should ensure that it is well integrated within their course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating the curriculum</h3>

<p>174.	Inspectors will consider the knowledge and skills that pupils will gain at each stage through the school’s curriculum (we call this ‘intent’). They will look at the scope of the curriculum, including how carefully leaders have thought about what end points the curriculum is building towards (where relevant, with reference to the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>). They will also look at how leaders have broken down the content into components and sequenced that content in a logical progression, systematically and explicitly, for all pupils to acquire the intended knowledge and skills. Inspectors will also consider the rigour of subject-specific planning.</p>

<p>175.	Inspectors will consider the how the curriculum developed or adopted by the school is taught and assessed in order to support pupils to build their knowledge and to apply that knowledge as skills (we call this ‘implementation’). This includes how well the subject curriculum is presented to ensure that pupils understand key concepts, and that they can transfer key knowledge to long-term memory and can apply it fluently. This includes the use of assessment to check pupils’ understanding of what the curriculum intent says they should know, and to identify and correct misunderstandings and inform teaching. It also includes whether teachers either have expert knowledge of the subjects that they teach, or are supported to address gaps in their knowledge so that pupils are not disadvantaged by ineffective teaching.</p>

<p>176.	Finally, inspectors will consider the outcomes that pupils achieve as a result of the education they have received (we call this ‘impact’). This will include their view on how those pupils are progressing through the curriculum, and their view on schemes of work or other long-term planning (in whatever form subject leaders normally use them).</p>

<p>177.	Inspectors will focus on what our inspection experience and research show are the most important factors to consider: These are the extent to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>is ambitious and designed to give pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, the knowledge they need to take advantage of opportunities, responsibilities and experiences in later life</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>is planned and sequenced so that the end points that it is building towards are clear and that pupils develop the knowledge and skills, building on what has been taught before, to be able to reach those end points</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has rigour, where relevant, so that pupils learn the knowledge that they need to answer subject-specific questions and to gain disciplinary knowledge of how the subject works (this should not prevent a topic-based or thematic approach, however)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>accounts for delays and gaps in learning that have arisen and continue to arise as a result of the pandemic</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>remains as broad as possible for as long as possible, including when delivered remotely. The school does not offer disadvantaged pupils or pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> an ungraded curriculum</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teachers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>have expert knowledge of the subjects that they teach and are supported, where necessary, to address gaps in their knowledge so that pupils are not disadvantaged by ineffective teaching</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>present information clearly, promote appropriate discussion, check pupils’ understanding systematically, and identify misunderstandings and adapt teaching as neccesary to correct these</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>deliver the subject curriculum in a way that allows pupils to transfer key knowledge to long-term memory. Teaching is sequenced so that new knowledge and skills build on what has been taught before and pupils can work towards clearly defined end points</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>use assessment to check pupils’ understanding to inform teaching, and to help pupils embed key concepts, use knowledge fluently and develop their understanding, and not simply memorise disconnected facts</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>consider the most important knowledge or concepts that pupils need to know and focus on these, and prioritise feedback, retrieval practice and assessment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ensure that remote education, if needed, enables all pupils to access lessons and learn, and monitor pupils’ engagement and communicate with parents and colleagues effectively if there are concerns</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>all</strong> pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>acquire the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>make progress, in that they know more, remember more and are able to do more. They are learning what is intended in the curriculum</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>produce work of high quality</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>achieve well in national tests and examinations, where relevant</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>are being prepared for their next stage of education, training or employment at each stage of their learning, including whether pupils in sixth form are ready for the next stage and are going on to appropriate, high-quality destinations</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>are able to read to an age-appropriate level and fluency (if not, they will be incapable of accessing the rest of the curriculum, and they will fall rapidly behind their peers)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>178.	In evaluating the quality of education, inspectors will form a top-level view of the curriculum through conversations with senior leaders and any available data. However, they will want to see first hand the quality of education as experienced by pupils and understand how well leaders know what it is like to be a pupil at the school. Inspectors’ understanding of the school’s curriculum is primarily formed through deep dives. We will look at the curriculum in all the key stages that the school has, through our deep dives.</p>

<p>179.	The number of deep dives will vary depending on the size of the school and the inspection team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in primary schools, inspectors will always carry out a deep dive in reading and deep dives in one or more foundation subjects. In addition, inspectors will often carry out a deep dive in mathematics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in secondary schools, the deep dives will typically focus on a sample of 4 to 6 subjects, looking at a wide variety of pupils in different year groups across that sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in small schools (with fewer than 75 pupils), the methodology will be adapted to reflect the shorter inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for special schools, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Applying-the-EIF">‘Independent special schools and provision for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in other independent schools’ section</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for alternative providers, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#alternative-provision">‘Alternative provision’ section</a> below</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>180.	Deep dives gather evidence of the curriculum within a certain subject, to build an understanding of the curriculum in the school as a whole. They encompass a range of activities including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>talking about the curriculum with leaders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>joint visits to lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work scrutiny</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>talking to and observing pupils in addition to joint visits to lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with teachers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>181.	Inspectors may not always carry out all of these activities on a deep dive. More detail on these activities can be found in the sections below.</p>

<p>182.	Inspectors will not grade intent, implementation and impact separately and will not grade individual lessons or teachers. Instead, inspectors will reach a single graded judgement for the quality of education, drawing on all the evidence they have gathered and using their professional judgement.</p>

<p>183.	Inspectors recognise that there may still be some limited circumstances in which a pupil may need to learn remotely. Where this is the case, it will not be evaluated separately but as part of the wider curriculum. Similarly, where the school is directly deploying tutors to support education recovery from the pandemic, inspectors will consider how this supports the aims of the school curriculum, rather than evaluate the quality of the tutoring. Use of tutors will be integrated into the evaluation of quality of education and leadership and management and will not be inspected separately.</p>

<p>184.	Inspectors will not analyse schools’ internal progress and attainment data during an inspection.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">[footnote 18]</a></sup> That does not mean that schools cannot use data where they consider it appropriate. Inspectors will, however, put more focus on the curriculum and less on schools’ generation, analysis and interpretation of data. Teachers have told us they believe this will help us play our part in reducing unnecessary workload. Inspectors will be interested in the conclusions drawn and actions taken from any internal assessment information, but they will not examine or verify that information first hand. Inspectors will use published national performance data as a starting point on inspection, where it is available.</p>

<p>185.	Inspectors will be alert to unnecessary or excessive attempts to simply prompt pupils to learn glossaries or long lists of disconnected facts. Learning can be defined as an alteration in long-term memory. If nothing has altered in long-term memory, nothing has been learned. However, pupils learn by connecting new knowledge with existing knowledge. Pupils also need to develop fluency and unconsciously apply their knowledge as skills. This must not be reduced to, or confused with, simply memorising disconnected facts. When inspectors evaluate the impact of the education provided by the school, their focus will primarily be on what pupils have learned.</p>

<p>186.	Inspectors will also bear in mind that developing and embedding an effective curriculum takes time, and that leaders may only be part-way through the process of adopting or redeveloping a curriculum. If leaders have an accurate evaluative understanding of current curriculum practice in their school and have identified appropriate next steps (taking into account any impact of COVID-19) to improve curriculum quality and develop curriculum expertise across the school, inspectors will evaluate ‘intent’ favourably when reaching the holistic quality of education judgement. They will recognise that the criteria for a judgement of good are the best fit. Where inspectors consider available national data, they will be mindful of the age of this data, especially around statutory assessment and qualifications, when making judgements. Teacher-assessed grades from 2020 and 2021 will not be used to assess curriculum impact.</p>

<p>187.	As part of making the judgement about the quality of education, inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life. Our understanding of ‘knowledge and cultural capital’ is derived from the following wording in the national curriculum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is the essential knowledge that pupils need to be educated citizens, introducing them to the best that has been thought and said and helping to engender an appreciation of human creativity and achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>188.	National assessments and examinations are useful indicators of pupils’ outcomes, but they only represent a sample of what pupils have learned. Inspectors will consider any published outcomes data, where this is available in published national data (this does not include teacher- or centre-assessed grades from 2020 and 2021). However, it does not constitute a substitute for inspectors’ first-hand inspection activities.</p>

<h4>Talking about the curriculum with leaders</h4>

<p>189.	Talking to relevant leaders is vital to understanding the curriculum within that subject. Inspectors understand that subject leadership works differently in different schools – especially smaller schools – and will work within that context in each school.</p>

<p>190.	Inspectors will want subject leaders to set out the scope of what they intend pupils to learn. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which there are clear end points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether subject content is broken down into appropriately sized steps and sequenced to build towards those end points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the rigour of subject-specific planning, where appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>191.	We define rigour as ensuring that the curriculum keeps to subject-specific questions, methods, conventions, rules and practices and how the subject discipline builds new knowledge. This should not prevent a topic-based or thematic approach, however. Inspectors will also want to understand the approach to teaching and assessing whether pupils have understood the content they have been taught.</p>

<h4>Joint visits to lessons</h4>

<p>192.	Inspectors will not take a random sample of lessons to visit. Instead, they will connect lesson visits to other evidence, such as discussions with curriculum leaders, teachers and pupils, and work scrutiny.</p>

<p>193.	Inspectors will discuss with leaders what lessons will be visited as part of the deep dive to see the curriculum in action. Where possible, inspectors will visit several lessons in which the same curriculum area or subject, including from different year groups. They will invite the proprietor, headteacher, subject leaders and/or other leaders to take part in joint visits to lessons.</p>

<p>194.	When a school offers a specialist curriculum, inspectors will normally visit lessons in both the specialist and the non-specialist aspects of the school’s provision (see the section <a class="govuk-link" href="#specialist-curriculum">‘Schools with a specialist curriculum’</a> in part 2 of this document).</p>

<p>195.	Lesson visits are not about evaluating individual teachers or their teaching. Teaching will not be graded. Inspectors will connect evidence from lesson visits with what they learn from other deep dive activities, to form a rounded view of the quality of education.</p>

<p>196.	Lesson visits are also useful for gathering evidence that contributes to the ‘behaviour and attitudes’ judgement by providing direct evidence about how behaviour is managed within individual classrooms and how pupils respond. This evidence will complement the other evidence that inspectors gather about behaviour during inspection.</p>

<p>197.	Alongside other evidence, inspectors will also use evidence gathered from visits to lessons to inform their judgements about whether the school meets the independent school standards. These include the standard about teaching (paragraph 3), the requirement to effectively implement a policy that promotes good behaviour among pupils (paragraph 9(b)) and the standard about the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils (paragraph 5).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">[footnote 19]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Work scrutiny</h4>

<p>198.	Inspectors will look at pupils’ work. Work scrutiny will help inspectors to form a view of whether pupils know more and can do more, and whether the knowledge and skills they have learned are well sequenced and have developed incrementally.</p>

<p>199.	Inspectors will also use evidence gathered from scrutiny of pupils’ work to inform their judgements about whether the school meets the independent school standards. These include the standard about teaching (paragraph 3) and the standard about the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils (paragraph 5).<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">[footnote 20]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Talking to and observing pupils in addition to joint visits to lessons</h4>

<p>200.	Inspectors will ask to speak to groups of pupils, including about the subjects they have been looking at. They will want to understand what pupils have learned and how their teachers help them to learn new curriculum content. Inspectors will take advantage of opportunities to gather evidence from a wide range of pupils, both formally and informally.</p>

<p>201.	Inspectors will also talk to and observe pupils in a range of situations outside of normal lessons to evaluate other aspects of personal development, behaviour and attitudes, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at the start and finish of the school day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during lunchtime, including in the dining hall, and breaktimes or playtimes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during assemblies and tutor periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when moving between lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during enrichment activities (including clubs and activities outside of the normal timetabled curriculum)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>202.	During informal conversations with pupils, inspectors must ask them about their experiences of teaching, learning and behaviour in the school, including the prevention of bullying and how the school deals with any form of harassment and violence, discrimination and prejudiced behaviour, if they happen. Inspectors will ensure that all questions are appropriate.</p>

<p>203.	During the inspection, it is important that pupils are able to express their views freely to inspectors. Therefore, inspectors must have the opportunity to speak to pupils with no other adults present. This is particularly important when inspectors ask pupils questions around safeguarding. Inspectors will also try to ensure that they speak to at least some single-sex pupil groups to provide the opportunity for pupils to speak more freely about issues such as sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence. If it is not possible to speak to pupils, it is unlikely that the school will be able to provide inspectors with the evidence they need to be able to conclude that these aspects of the school’s provision meet the requirements of the independent school standards. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspectors-talking-to-pupils-on-inspection">‘Inspectors talking to pupils on inspection’</a>.</p>

<h4>Discussions with staff</h4>

<p>204.	Inspectors will discuss with staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how the school’s curriculum informs their choices about content and sequencing to support pupils’ learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the training and support that they receive helps them to deliver the content effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their workload, including whether assessment practices create any unnecessary burdens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other matters, including those related to safeguarding and pupils’ behaviour</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Schools with a specialist curriculum</h4>

<p>205.	Some non-association independent schools offer a specialist curriculum and Ofsted recognises their autonomy to do so. For example, some schools offer a specialist faith-based curriculum, while others offer a specialist education in the performing arts.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">[footnote 21]</a></sup> Other independent schools, such as Steiner schools, take a distinct approach to the curriculum, even though the majority of the subjects on offer to do not differ significantly from other schools.</p>

<p>206.	Alongside any specialist education provided, it is important that pupils study a broad, rich curriculum. This is supported by Ofsted’s research, and is a requirement of paragraph 2(2)(a) of the independent school standards.</p>

<p>207.	Inspectors will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when assessing compliance with the independent school standards<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">[footnote 22]</a></sup> and when reaching judgements in the following areas: overall effectiveness; behaviour and attitudes; personal development; and leadership and management.</p>

<p>208.	When reaching a judgement under the quality of education judgement area, inspectors will work with school leaders to understand how the curriculum as a whole is structured, and where they can find evidence that the quality of education criteria are met. We expect that, in most schools, much of the evidence in support of the criteria will be drawn from the non-specialist curriculum, as most schools structure their curriculum such that the specialist curriculum supplements rather than directly delivers the academic core of subjects.</p>

<p>209.	However, we will judge fairly those schools that take radically different approaches to the curriculum, including, for example, schools that teach a range of academic subjects through a faith-based curriculum. Inspectors will assess any school’s curriculum favourably when leaders have built a curriculum with appropriate coverage, content, structure and sequencing and implemented it effectively. They are, however, likely to assess it negatively where the specialist curriculum is being delivered in a way that limits pupils’ opportunities to study a broad range of subjects, or which fails to prepare them for life in modern Britain.</p>

<h4>Early stages of learning to read in schools with pupils up to Year 3 (or up to Years 5 to 6 for those schools where early reading is delayed due to an exemption)</h4>

<p>210.	During all inspections, inspectors will be interested in how the school supports pupils who are at the early stages of learning to read, including older pupils. This is especially the case because of the disruption to learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>211.	On inspections of schools with pupils up to Year 3 (or up to Years 5 to 6 for those schools where early reading is delayed due to an exemption), inspectors <strong>will</strong> carry out a deep dive to evaluate how well pupils are taught to read. They will pay particular attention to pupils who are reading below age-related expectations (the lowest 20%) to assess how well the school is teaching phonics and supporting all children to become confident, fluent readers. This will include understanding how reading is taught remotely, where applicable.</p>

<p>212.	Except where <a class="govuk-link" href="#formal-teaching-of-reading-delayed">paragraph 214</a> applies, inspectors will listen to several low-attaining pupils in Years 1 to 3 read from unseen books that are appropriate to their stage of progress. They should also draw on information from the school’s policy for teaching reading, phonics assessments, phonics screening check results and lesson visits.</p>

<p>213.	Wherever possible, inspectors should listen to children read to a familiar adult in a classroom or in an open area that the pupils are familiar with. They will take into consideration the length of time a pupil has attended the school.</p>

<p>214.	The formal teaching of reading may be delayed by an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers">exemption from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr></a>. In these cases, inspectors will hear children from Years 5 to 6 read instead of Years 1 to 3. They will listen to pupils read from unseen books appropriate to their stage of progress to see whether they have the reading knowledge and skills, including the phonic knowledge, appropriate for a child in Years 5 to 6. This will inform the quality of education judgement.</p>

<p>215.	In reaching an evaluation against the ‘quality of education’ judgement, and taking account of any relevant exemption from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, inspectors will consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school is determined that every pupil will learn to read, regardless of their background, needs or abilities. All pupils, including the weakest readers, make sufficient progress to meet or exceed age-related expectations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stories, poems, rhymes and non-fiction are chosen for reading to develop pupils’ vocabulary, language comprehension and love of reading. Pupils are familiar with and enjoy listening to a wide range of stories, poems, rhymes and non-fiction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s phonics programme matches or exceeds the expectations of the national curriculum and the early learning goals. The school has clear expectations of pupils’ phonics progress term by term, particularly from Reception to Year 2 (except where <a class="govuk-link" href="#formal-teaching-of-reading-delayed">paragraph 214</a> applies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sequence of reading books shows a cumulative progression in phonics knowledge that is matched closely to the school’s phonics programme. Teachers give pupils sufficient practice in reading and re-reading books that match the grapheme–phoneme correspondences they know, both at school and at home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reading, including the teaching of systematic, synthetic phonics, is taught from the beginning of Reception (except where <a class="govuk-link" href="#formal-teaching-of-reading-delayed">paragraph 214</a> applies)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in Reception, staff teach children to read systematically by using synthetic phonics and books that match the children’s phonic knowledge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ongoing assessment of pupils’ phonics progress is sufficiently frequent and detailed to identify any pupil who is falling behind the programme’s pace. If they do fall behind, targeted support is given immediately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school has developed sufficient expertise in the teaching of phonics and reading</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Mathematics</h4>

<p>216.	When inspectors look at mathematics, they will evaluate the quality of a school’s mathematics education through lesson visits, discussions with pupils and scrutiny of their work, discussions with subject leaders, and examining any published data. This will include understanding how mathematics is taught remotely, where applicable.</p>

<p>217.	Inspectors will consider what steps the school has taken to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pupils understand and remember the mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures appropriate for their starting points, including knowledge of efficient algorithms. This should also ensure that pupils are ready for the next stage, whether that is the next lesson, unit of work, year or key stage, including post-16 mathematics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum planning for mathematics carefully sequences knowledge, concepts and procedures to build mathematical knowledge and skills systematically and, over time, the curriculum draws connections across different ways of looking at mathematical ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the curriculum divides new material into manageable steps lesson by lesson</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum identifies opportunities when mathematical reasoning and solving problems will allow pupils to make useful connections between identified mathematical ideas or to anticipate practical problems they are likely to encounter in adult life. Pupils have sufficient understanding of and unconscious competence in, prerequisite mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures that are necessary to succeed in the specific tasks set</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within the curriculum, there are sufficient opportunities planned to revisit previously learned knowledge, concepts and procedures; this is to ensure that, once learned, mathematical knowledge becomes deeply embedded in pupils’ memories. This then allows rapid and accurate recall and frees pupils’ attention so they can work with increasing independence, apply their mathematical knowledge to more complex concepts and procedures and gain enjoyment through a growing self-confidence in their ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is flexibility in curriculum planning so that the school can address identified gaps in pupils’ mathematical knowledge that hinder their capacity to learn and apply new content. Those pupils behind age-related expectations are provided with the opportunities to learn the mathematical knowledge and skills necessary to catch up with their peers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are objective assessments that can identify when all pupils have gained the intended understanding and unconscious competence in knowledge, concepts and procedures necessary before they move on to new or more complex content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teaching models new procedures and uses resources and approaches that enable pupils to understand the mathematics they are learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all teachers of mathematics, including non-specialist teachers of mathematics, have sufficient mathematical and teaching content knowledge to deliver topics effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupils’ mathematical knowledge is developed and used, where appropriate, across the curriculum</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Independent special schools and provision for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in other independent schools</h3>

<p>218.	All parts of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> apply to independent special schools, and to <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> provision in mainstream independent schools. However, as with all provision, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> provision has some specific factors that should be taken into account.</p>

<p>219.	Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> have a range of different needs and starting points. Pupils will have unique, individual needs, even where their needs may fall under the same umbrella term, such as autism. Some pupils have severe, complex or profound needs that have a significant impact on their cognitive development, especially the way that they are able to make alterations to their long-term memory. Other pupils have starting points at least as high as other pupils of their age, for instance some pupils with sensory impairments.</p>

<p>220.	Inspectors will gather and evaluate evidence about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders are suitably ambitious for all pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders identify, assess and meet the needs of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, including when pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are self-isolating and/or receiving remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that the curriculum is coherently sequenced to meet all pupils’ needs, starting points and aspirations for the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how successfully leaders involve parents, carers and, as necessary, other professionals/specialist services in deciding how best to support pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, including when agreeing the approach to remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders include pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in all aspects of school life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of any different or additional provision being made for them, including any reasonable adjustments in remote education provision. This covers outcomes in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>communication and interaction</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cognition and learning</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>physical health and development</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>social, emotional and mental health</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are prepared for their next steps in education, employment and training, and their adult lives including further/higher education and employment, independent living, participating in society and being as healthy as possible in adult life. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">‘Special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years’</a>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>221.	Because of the wide range of pupils’ needs, inspectors will not compare the outcomes achieved by pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> with those achieved by other pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in the school, locally or nationally.</p>

<p>222.	Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> often have significant and complex vulnerabilities and can face additional safeguarding challenges. This includes understanding and pre-empting increased risks that pupils may be drawn into harmful situations as a result of grooming, be more likely to experience abuse from other pupils or adults and may experience additional barriers in reporting abuse and having abuse recognised by professionals. Inspectors will evaluate the ways in which leaders have made appropriate and effective safeguarding arrangements that reflect these additional vulnerabilities, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>223.	In special schools, the curriculum may be very specialised. For this reason, in special schools, deep dive areas may not be traditional subject areas. The lead inspector will seek to understand the school’s curriculum during the initial phone call with the headteacher. Once the lead inspector has understood the school’s curriculum design, the areas for a deep dive will be agreed. These may include national curriculum subjects, may derive from the 4 broad areas of need (for example, communication and interaction or physical development), may be a curriculum area very specific to that school or may be a combination of these examples. Inspectors will work closely with leaders and staff to understand how the curriculum area they are looking at is designed and implemented to meet the needs of pupils in the school. Inspectors will evaluate if pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of the curriculum.</p>

<h3>Independent special schools with section 41 approval</h3>

<p>224.	Independent schools that are organised to cater specifically for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are normally registered with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> as an ‘independent special school’; however, there is no legal definition of this term.</p>

<p>225.	Under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/section/41" rel="external">section 41 of the Children and Families Act 2014</a>, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> can approve independent schools that are organised to cater specifically for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> for the purpose of enabling the school <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-special-schools-and-colleges">‘to be the subject of a request for it to be named in an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan’</a>.</p>

<p>226.	Independent schools that are not approved under section 41 can still admit pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>227.	If an approved independent special school is named in an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan, the local authority must comply with the request to place the pupil at the school, and the school must admit the pupil. If a school is not approved under section 41, and is named in an <abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr> plan, there is no duty for the local authority to place the pupil in the school.</p>

<h3>Evaluating alternative provision used by any type of independent school</h3>

<p>228.	If pupils in registered independent schools attend off-site alternative provision, inspectors will evaluate the extent to which these placements are safe and effective in promoting pupils’ progress. Inspectors must visit a sample of the alternative providers used by the school. Inspectors will want to understand how providers ensure that pupils who attend multiple settings or part time are kept safe when they are not on site for the whole school day.</p>

<h3>Alternative provision registered as an independent school</h3>

<p>229.	Alternative providers that are registered as an independent school may differ from other independent schools in that they are often intended to provide short-term interventions to secure the successful re-engagement into education.</p>

<p>230.	All parts of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> apply to alternative providers registered as an independent school, and these providers must meet all the independent school standards.</p>

<p>231.	In these settings, inspectors will gather and evaluate evidence about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders identify, assess and meet the needs of pupils when they first begin to attend the school, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that the curriculum meets the requirements of the independent school standards, is coherently sequenced and meets all pupils’ needs, starting points and aspirations for the future, including through remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how successfully leaders involve parents, carers and, as necessary, other professionals or specialist services in deciding how best to support pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders are ambitious for all pupils, and the extent to which those responsible for governance understand the particular context of the provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders include pupils in all aspects of school life, giving particular emphasis to how well they are prepared for their next steps in education, employment and training, and adult lives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that schools assess pupils’ learning and development, and whether pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of the different or additional provision being made for them, including outcomes for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>232.	Pupils in alternative provision registered as an independent school often have significant, complex vulnerabilities. In the same way as with other schools, inspectors will evaluate the ways in which leaders have made appropriate and effective safeguarding arrangements for pupils in the light of their higher vulnerability to safeguarding risks, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will expect providers to understand their unique contextual safeguarding factors and outline how they proactively work, including with other agencies, to mitigate the specific factors that affect their pupils and the community that they serve.</p>

<p>233.	Alternative providers may have different objectives in their work, related to the reasons why a pupil is placed in alternative provision, the needs of the pupil, the duration of placements and the proportion of time that pupils stay with the provider each week. For instance, in alternative provision that provides short-term placements for excluded pupils or those at risk of exclusion, the core work may emphasise specific improvements in pupils’ attitudes, behaviour and/or attendance alongside their academic/vocational/technical achievement or be aiming to reintegrate pupils into mainstream independent schools. Alternative providers may also offer services to registered independent schools and other educational settings to help them support children with additional needs in their settings. An alternative provision setting may be the permanent destination for some pupils. Inspectors will evaluate schools’ success in these areas while bearing in mind that we expect high academic/vocational/technical aspirations for all pupils.</p>

<p>234.	Transitions into alternative providers registered as independent schools are often complex, involving dual registration, periods of non-attendance and meetings with a range of services and families. When evaluating pupils’ attainment and progress, inspectors will consider the ways in which leaders have identified, assessed and met the needs of pupils. They will evaluate the progress that pupils have made since they began to attend the alternative provision.</p>

<p>235.	For pupils who have left the school, inspectors will consider how well the progress they made there enabled them to move on to suitable destinations and, post-16, to take courses at an appropriately demanding level. They will also look closely at how effective liaison is with other schools to ensure that there are appropriately high expectations and, as far as reasonably possible, continuity in pupils’ education programmes. Inspectors will also look at whether the provider works closely with families, schools and other agencies to ensure a smooth transition to and from any external alternative provision. They will look at whether it sets expectations that reintegration back into mainstream education is a key component of a placement. Inspectors will also look at whether the provider has adapted its approach to transition in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>236.	The behaviour and attitudes judgement considers how leaders and staff create a safe, calm, orderly and positive environment in the school and the impact this has on the behaviour and attitudes of pupils.</p>

<p>237.	The judgement focuses on the factors that <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hmci-commentary-curriculum-and-the-new-education-inspection-framework">research and inspection evidence</a> indicate contribute most strongly to pupils’ positive behaviour and attitudes, thereby giving them the greatest possible opportunity to achieve positive outcomes. These factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>having a calm and orderly environment in the school and the classroom, as this is essential for pupils to be able to learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>setting clear routines and expectations for the behaviour of pupils across all aspects of school life, not just in the classroom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having a strong focus on attendance and punctuality that disruption is minimised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having clear and effective behaviour and attendance policies, with clearly defined consequences that are applied consistently and fairly by all staff; children, and particularly adolescents, often have particularly strong concepts of fairness that may be challenged by different treatment by different teachers or of different pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing pupils’ motivation and positive attitudes to learning as important predictors of attainment. Developing positive attitudes can also have a longer-term impact on how pupils approach learning tasks in later stages of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fostering a positive and respectful school culture in which staff know and care about pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>creating an environment in which pupils feel safe, and in which bullying, discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and sexual violence – online or offline – are not accepted and are dealt with quickly, consistently and effectively whenever they occur</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>238.	Inspectors’ evidence for the importance of each of these factors comes from our inspection experience, areas of agreement in academic research and our own research. A full note of how the criteria relate to the available research can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework-overview-of-research"><abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> research commentary</a>.</p>

<p>239.	Additionally, inspectors will expect schools to have effective behaviour policies in place regarding harmful sexual behaviour. The policies should include details of appropriate sanctions that should be consistently applied and that reflect the messages that are taught across the curriculum.</p>

<p>240.	Inspectors will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when reaching a judgement about behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h3>

<h4>Pupils who have particular needs, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>
</h4>

<p>241.	The school may be working with pupils with particular needs in order to improve their behaviour or their attendance. When this is the case, behaviour and conduct that reflects the school’s high expectations and their consistent, fair implementation are likely to include demonstrable improvement in the attendance and behaviour of these pupils, taking account of the individual circumstances of the school.</p>

<h4>Pupils who are not in the school during the inspection</h4>

<p>242.	Inspectors will gather evidence about the typical behaviour of all the pupils who attend the school, including those who are not present on the day of inspection. If there is evidence that a school has deliberately removed pupils from the school site on the day of inspection, or has arranged for them to be absent, and inspectors reasonably believe that this was done in order to have an impact on the inspection, then inspectors are likely to judge both behaviour and attitudes and leadership and management to be inadequate.</p>

<h4>Suspensions and exclusions</h4>

<p>243.	If a school uses suspensions, inspectors will evaluate their effectiveness, including the rates, patterns and reasons for exclusion and whether any pupils are repeatedly excluded. Schools should have a strategy for reintegrating a pupil who returns to school following a suspension and for managing their future behaviour. Inspectors will consider how well the school is recognising and acting to address any patterns that exist. This is because disruptive behaviour or sudden changes in behaviour can be an indication of unmet needs or a change in another aspect of a young person’s life.</p>

<p>244.	Headteachers have the right to exclude pupils when there are legitimate reasons for them to do so. Used correctly, exclusion is a vital measure for headteachers to use. Exclusions must be legal and justified. Permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach or persistent breaches of the school’s behaviour policy, and when allowing the pupil to remain in school would seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others in the school.</p>

<p>245.	Inspectors will consider whether the school is developing the use of alternative strategies to exclusion and taking account of any safeguarding risks to pupils who may be excluded. Inspectors will recognise when schools are doing all that they can to support pupils at risk of exclusion, including through tenacious attempts to engage local support services.</p>

<h4>Evaluating behaviour and attitudes in alternative provision registered as an independent school</h4>

<p>246.	Inspectors will take the school’s official records as a starting point for discussions about attendance. They must evaluate pupils’ attendance as a percentage of a full-time timetable, even when temporary part-time arrangements are in place. Leaders may have a range of ways of evaluating pupils’ attendance, given that pupils may join and leave the school roll at different times of the year. Inspectors will take into account the turnover of pupils in the provision when considering evidence for attitudes and behaviour. Inspectors will evaluate the impact of strategies that leaders use to improve pupils’ attendance.</p>

<p>247.	Often, pupils attending alternative providers registered as independent schools, have had poor attendance in the past. Inspectors will evaluate the improvement in pupils’ attendance from their starting points when this is relevant. Inspectors will also evaluate the ways in which leaders take account of pupils’ weak attendance in their safeguarding systems and the clarity of their attendance recording. If schools use part-time timetables, and pupils are not attending other provision or placements in addition to their school, inspectors will evaluate the extent to which schools monitor these situations and are aspirational and effective in getting pupils into education full time, quickly and in line with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance. Part-time timetables should not be open-ended and should result in swift full-time education for the pupils.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h3>

<p>248.	Inspectors will hold discussions with pupils and staff to gather evidence about school culture and practice in relation to pupils’ behaviour, support for staff and other systems. In setting up discussions, inspectors will select a sample of staff, as research suggests that staff are most affected by pupils’ challenging behaviour. These discussions will include trainees, supply staff, <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, administrative support staff and catering staff, as well as other members of staff. The discussions will provide inspectors with valuable information that includes the views of those who most urgently require the school’s support in managing pupils’ behaviour. Where practically possible, inspectors should carry out discussions with individuals, not groups, to allow members of staff to give clear evidence without being influenced by the views or expectations of others in the group when talking about a sensitive issue.</p>

<p>249.	Inspectors will speak to pupils from a range of different backgrounds and who have different experiences of the school’s approach to behaviour. This should include pupils who have experienced sanctions under the school’s behaviour policy. Inspectors will take into account the views of these pupils, their experiences of others’ behaviour and attitudes towards them, and their understanding of the importance of positive behaviour in school and beyond school.</p>

<p>250.	Inspectors will evaluate the experience of particular individuals and groups, such as pupils for whom referrals have been made to the local authority (and check for a small sample of these pupils, how the referral was made and the thoroughness of the follow-up), pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, children looked after, those with medical needs and those with mental health needs. In order to do this, inspectors will look at the experience of a small sample of these pupils and consider the way the school is working with the multi-agency group to ensure that the child receives the support they need. For pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, this will include ensuring that appropriate reasonable adjustments are made in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 and the <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> code of practice.</p>

<p>251.	The pupil and staff surveys used in inspection contain questions about safeguarding, behaviour and discipline, bullying, how respondents feel about the school and how well supported and respected they feel they are in the school. Inspectors will meet school leaders to account for the results of the interviews and surveys of pupils and staff.</p>

<p>252.	Over the course of inspection, inspectors will carry out evidence-gathering activities. In some cases, inspectors will be able to gather this evidence as part of other activities they are carrying out. The activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ behaviour in a range of different classes at different times of the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils at breaktimes, lunchtimes, between lessons and, where they are led and managed by the school, before- and after-school clubs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ punctuality in arriving at school and at lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ respect for, and courtesy and good manners towards each other and adults, and their pride in themselves and their school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the school’s analysis of, and response to, pupils’ behaviour over time, in whatever format the school already has</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysing absence and persistent absence rates for all pupils, and for different groups compared with national averages for all pupils; this includes the extent to which low attenders are improving their attendance over time and whether attendance is consistently low</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the prevalence of permanent exclusion, the procedures surrounding this and the reasons for it, and the support given to make sure that it is a last resort</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the effectiveness of suspensions, including the rates and reasons for exclusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assessing the school’s work to follow up and support suspended pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering the views of parents, staff, those with responsibility for governance and other stakeholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering evidence about the typical behaviour of pupils who are not in school during the inspection, for example whether they have had suspensions in the 2 years before inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>balancing evidence seen during the inspection and also evidence of trends over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visiting any off-site unit that the school runs (on its own or in partnership with other schools) for pupils whose behaviour is poor or who have low attendance. Inspectors will assess safeguarding procedures, the quality of education and how effectively the unit helps to improve pupils’ behaviour, learning and attendance. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#off-site-provision">‘Inspecting alternative provision used by any type of independent school’ section (paragraphs 317 to 323)</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>253.	Inspectors will recognise that the context in which schools operate has changed as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, they will consider the specific context and the steps school leaders have taken to ensure the best possible rates of attendance since the school opened to all pupils in March 2021. Attendance between March 2020 and March 2021 will not impact on our judgement of the school.</p>

<h2>Evaluating personal development</h2>

<p>254.	The curriculum provided by schools should extend beyond the academic, technical or vocational. Schools support pupils to develop in many diverse aspects of life. The personal development judgement is used by inspectors to evaluate the school’s intent to provide for the personal development of all pupils, and the quality with which the school implements this work. Inspectors will recognise that the impact of the school’s provision for personal development will often not be assessable during pupils’ time at school.</p>

<p>255.	At the same time as the school is working with pupils, those pupils are also being influenced by other factors in their home environment, their community and elsewhere. Schools can teach pupils how to build their confidence and resilience, for example, but they cannot always determine how well young people draw on this. Schools are crucial in preparing pupils for their adult lives, teaching them to understand how to engage with society and providing them with plentiful opportunities to do so. In this judgement, therefore, inspectors will seek to evaluate the quality and intent of what a school provides (either directly or by drawing on high-quality agencies and providers, for example the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme, Cadet Forces and the National Citizenship Service), but will not attempt to measure the impact of the school’s work on the lives of individual pupils.</p>

<p>256.	Where usual opportunities have been disrupted by the pandemic, inspectors will look at whether the school has found alternative approaches to providing a rich range of personal development opportunities since the school reopened to all pupils in March 2021.</p>

<p>257.	This judgement focuses on the dimensions of the personal development of pupils that our education system has agreed, either by consensus or statute, are the most significant. These include how the school:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensures that curriculum subjects such as citizenship, RE, and other areas such as personal, social, health and economic education, and relationships and sex education, contribute to pupils’ personal development – including by considering the provision, quality and take-up of extra-curricular activities offered by the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils to become responsible, respectful and active citizens who are able to play their part and become actively involved in public life as adults</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>through the curriculum, assemblies, wider opportunities, visits, discussions and literature, develops and deepens pupils’ understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law and mutual respect and tolerance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promotes equality of opportunity so that all pupils can thrive together, understanding that difference is a positive, not a negative, and that individual characteristics make people unique. This includes, but is not limited to, pupils’ understanding of the protected characteristics and how equality and diversity are promoted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensures an inclusive environment that meets the needs of all pupils, irrespective of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation and where no discrimination exists, for example in respect of wider opportunities for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ characters, which we define as a set of positive personal traits, dispositions and virtues that informs pupils’ motivation and guides their conduct so that they reflect wisely, learn eagerly, behave with integrity and cooperate consistently well with others. This gives pupils the qualities they need to flourish in our society</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ confidence, resilience and knowledge so that they can keep themselves mentally healthy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enables pupils to recognise online and offline risks to their well-being – for example from criminal and sexual exploitation, domestic abuse, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, substance misuse, gang activity, radicalisation and extremism – and making them aware of the support available to them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enables pupils to recognise the dangers of inappropriate use of mobile technology and social media</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ understanding of how to keep physically healthy, eat healthily and maintain an active lifestyle, including giving ample opportunities for pupils to be active during the school day and through extra-curricular activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ age-appropriate understanding of healthy relationships through appropriate relationships and sex education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provides an effective careers programme in line with the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-provision-for-young-people-in-schools">statutory guidance on careers advice</a> that offers pupils:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>unbiased careers advice</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>experience of work, and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>contact with employers</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>to encourage pupils to aspire, make good choices and understand what they need to do to reach and succeed in the careers to which they aspire</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supports readiness for the next phase of education, training or employment so that pupils are equipped to make the transition successfully</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in special schools, enriches the curriculum, taking into account specific factors such as the local area’s arrangements for providing home-to-school transport for children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>258.	We will expect the school’s relationships, sex and health education curriculum (and wider curriculum) to specifically address sexual harassment, online abuse and sexual violence. The curriculum should also address safeguarding risks (including online risks), issues of consent, and what constitutes a healthy relationship both online and offline. We will also expect schools to provide effective pastoral support. This includes being alert to factors that increase a child’s vulnerability, or potential vulnerability, such as mental ill health, domestic abuse, having additional needs, and being at greater risk of exploitation and/or of feeling unable to report abuse (for example, girls and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children).</p>

<p>259.	Inspectors will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when reaching a judgement about personal development.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating personal development</h3>

<h4>Relationships, sex and health education</h4>

<p>260.	Relationships education is compulsory for all primary school pupils and relationships and sex education is compulsory for all secondary school pupils. Health education is also compulsory for pupils in state-funded schools only. Independent schools are already required to teach health education as part of the requirement to teach personal, social, health and economic education in paragraph 2(2)(d) of the independent school standards.</p>

<p>261.	If a school is failing to meet its obligations, inspectors will consider this when reaching the personal development and leadership and management judgements.</p>

<p>262.	See the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools">‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics’</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development</h4>

<p>263.	Inspectors will evaluate the effectiveness of the school’s provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural education. This is a broad concept that can be seen across the school’s activities, but draws together many of the areas covered by the personal development judgement.</p>

<p>264.	Provision for the spiritual development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ability to be reflective about their own beliefs (religious or otherwise), and perspective on life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of, and respect for, different people’s faiths, feelings and values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sense of enjoyment and fascination in learning about themselves, others and the world around them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use of imagination and creativity in their learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to reflect on their experiences</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>265.	Provision for the moral development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ability to recognise the difference between right and wrong and to readily apply this understanding in their own lives, and to recognise legal boundaries and, in doing so, respect the civil and criminal law of England</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understanding of the consequences of their behaviour and actions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interest in investigating and offering reasoned views about moral and ethical issues and ability to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others on these issues</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>266.	Provision for the social development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use of a range of social skills in different contexts, for example working and socialising with other pupils, including those from different religious, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to participate in a variety of communities and social settings, including by volunteering, cooperating well with others and being able to resolve conflicts effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>acceptance of and engagement with the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. They will develop and demonstrate skills and attitudes that will allow them to participate fully in and contribute positively to life in modern Britain</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>267.	Provision for the cultural development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understanding and appreciation of the wide range of cultural influences that have shaped their own heritage and that of others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understanding and appreciation of the range of different cultures in the school and further afield as an essential element of their preparation for life in modern Britain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ability to recognise, and value, the things we share in common across cultural, religious, ethnic and socio-economic communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of Britain’s democratic Parliamentary system and its central role in shaping our history and values, and in continuing to develop Britain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to participate in and respond positively to artistic, musical, sporting and cultural opportunities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interest in exploring, improving understanding of and showing respect for different faiths and cultural diversity and the extent to which they understand, accept and respect diversity. This is shown by their respect and attitudes towards different religious, ethnic and socio-economic groups in the local, national and global communities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>268.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">‘The independent school standards: guidance for independent schools’</a>. This includes previously published non-statutory advice to help schools understand their obligations relating to a school’s provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating personal development</h3>

<p>269.	Much of the evidence that inspectors will consider in making the personal development judgement will be drawn from across the deep dives carried out, and conversations with leaders, staff, pupils and governors. Inspectors will also draw on any other evidence they consider as part of the inspection.</p>

<h2>Evaluating leadership and management</h2>

<p>270.	The leadership and management judgement is about how proprietors, leaders, managers and those responsible for governance ensure that the education that the school provides has a positive impact on all its pupils. It focuses on the areas where inspection and research indicate that leaders and managers can have the strongest effect on the quality of the education provided by the school. Important factors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders’ high expectations of all pupils in the school, and the extent to which these are embodied in leaders’ and staff’s day-to-day interactions with pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders focus their attention on the education provided by the school. There are many demands on leaders, but a greater focus on this area is associated with better outcomes for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether continuing professional development for teachers and staff is aligned with the curriculum, and the extent to which this develops teachers’ content knowledge and teaching content knowledge over time, so that they are able to deliver better teaching for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders create coherence and consistency across the school so that pupils benefit from effective teaching and consistent expectations, wherever they are in the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders seek to engage parents and their community thoughtfully and positively in a way that supports pupils’ education. Also, whether leaders are thoughtful in drawing boundaries and resisting inappropriate attempts to influence what is taught and the day-to-day life of the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders take into account the workload and well-being of their staff, while also developing and strengthening the quality of the workforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders’ and managers’ high ambitions are for all pupils, including those who are harder to reach. This includes ensuring that practices such as ‘off-rolling’ do not take place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders and those responsible for governance all understand their respective roles and perform these in a way that enhances the effectiveness of the school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>271.	Our evidence for the importance of each of these factors comes from our inspection experience, areas of consensus in academic research and our own research. A full note of how the criteria relate to the available research can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework-overview-of-research"><abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> research commentary</a>.</p>

<p>272.	<a class="govuk-link" href="#safeguarding">The ‘safeguarding’ section</a> sets out the importance of safeguarding and its place on inspection.</p>

<p>273.	In reaching a judgement about the school’s leadership and management, inspectors will take account of any of the independent school standards that are not met and consider what this means for the quality and effectiveness of each aspect of the school’s work. The grade descriptors make clear that for leadership and management to be judged good or outstanding, all of the standards must be met. However, the grade descriptors do not replace the professional judgement of inspectors, and it is down to the inspection team to determine if the impact of any unmet standards is such that the leadership and management should be judged requires improvement or inadequate as a result.</p>

<p>274.	Inspectors will also consider whether leaders are fulfilling all of their legal responsibilities associated with the running of the school, for example in relation to any international students.</p>

<p>275.	Inspectors will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when reaching a judgement about leadership and management.</p>

<h3>Different levels of leadership</h3>

<h4>Leadership and management in school</h4>

<p>276.	Inspectors will look at the work of headteachers, senior leaders, subject leaders and others with leadership and management roles when reaching this judgement.</p>

<h4>Leadership and management in independent schools that are part of a group of schools</h4>

<p>277.	Where a school is part of a group of schools, it is important for inspectors to remember that the proprietor will be the head of this group and they are responsible for the quality of education provided in all the schools in the group.</p>

<p>278.	It is highly likely that parts of some of the leadership functions described in the grade criteria are performed by school leaders, although the proprietor may have responsibility for local governance. It is the responsibility of school leaders to give inspectors accurate and appropriate information about those roles and responsibilities. Inspectors will expect to speak directly with the proprietor during the inspection.</p>

<p>279.	Leaders of groups of schools (for example, the chief executive or an education director) may request to meet inspectors during the inspection. They may also request to attend key inspection team meetings at the end of each inspection day. These are appropriate requests and should be accommodated. These individuals, however, should abide by the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">code of conduct</a> as all others involved in the inspection.</p>

<h4>Governance</h4>

<p>280.	Inspectors will seek evidence of the impact of those responsible for governance. This includes the impact of the proprietor. Where there is a proprietor body and/or governing body, inspectors will speak to as many members as possible.</p>

<p>281.	Inspectors will consider whether those responsible for governance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold senior leaders to account for the educational performance of the organisation and its pupils, and the performance management of staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>oversee the financial performance of the organisation and make sure that its money is well spent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>282.	Inspectors will explore how the proprietor and, where relevant, governors carry out each of these functions. For example, the clarity of the school’s vision, ethos and strategic direction will have a significant impact on the decisions that leaders make about the curriculum. Inspectors will consider whether the work of the proprietor and, where relevant, governors in this respect is supporting the school to provide a high-quality education for its pupils.</p>

<p>283.	The proprietor is responsible for ensuring that the school meets all paragraphs in all parts of the independent school standards. In addition, the proprietor and those responsible for governance are responsible for ensuring that the school fulfils its statutory duties, for example under the Equality Act 2010, and other duties, such as in relation to the ‘Prevent’ duty and safeguarding. Please note that, when inspectors consider whether the proprietor and, where relevant, governors are fulfilling this responsibility, they are not expected to construct or review a list of duties.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating leadership and management</h3>

<h4>Use of catch-up funding for independent special schools</h4>

<p>284.	Inspectors will gather evidence about the use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/catch-up-premium-coronavirus-covid-19/catch-up-premium">catch-up premium for independent special schools</a>, particularly regarding how leaders have spent the funding, their rationale for this spending and its intended impact on the learning and progress of pupils.</p>

<h4>External support</h4>

<p>285.	If the school has received external support, inspectors will not evaluate or report on the quality or the impact of the support and challenge on improvement in the school. Instead, they will comment on the action that the school has taken and the impact that this has had on the quality of the school’s work.</p>

<h4>Separation by sex</h4>

<p>286.	It is unlawful for schools to separate pupils on the basis of any protected characteristics such as sex, race or religion or belief while at school, unless permitted by the Equality Act 2010, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>positive action to alleviate a disadvantage associated with a certain characteristic. This could, for example, include pupils of one race or sex getting additional work experience in a sector in which they are under-represented, or separating the pupils by sex for teaching in subjects if the school has evidence that this improves their academic outcomes (section 158)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>competitive sport, games or other competitive activities in which physical strength, stamina or physique are significant factors in determining success or failure. A school is allowed to organise separate events for boys and girls (section 195)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>287.	If an inspector believes that a school may be separating pupils unlawfully, they will contact the duty desk. If unlawful discrimination is taking place, inspectors will write about this clearly in the inspection report. The separation may have an impact on the schools grade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a school is unlikely to be judged as good or outstanding in leadership and management if it is segregating pupils unlawfully</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the school has genuine and imminent plans to reintegrate pupils, a judgement of requires improvement will normally be appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in other cases, the grade will likely be inadequate for leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>288.	Where appropriate, inspectors will also refer to the following guidance:</p>

<ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics</h4>

<p>289.	How a school meets the expectations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance on relationships education, relationships and sex education and health education</a> contributes to the leadership and management judgement.</p>

<p>290.		If a primary school does not teach about lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships, this will not have an impact on the leadership and management judgement as long as the school can satisfy inspectors that it has still fulfilled the requirements of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance. If it cannot do this, for example if it has failed to consult with parents, inspectors will consider this when making the leadership and management judgement. In those circumstances, the school will not ordinarily receive a judgement for this better than requires improvement.</p>

<p>291.		If a secondary school does not teach about lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships, it will not be meeting the expectations of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance. Inspectors will consider this when making the leadership and management judgement. In those circumstances, the school will not ordinarily receive a judgement for this better than requires improvement.</p>

<p>292.	See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools">‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics’</a> for further guidance.</p>

<h4>Workload</h4>

<p>293.	When used effectively, assessment helps pupils to embed knowledge and use it fluently, and assists teachers in producing clear next steps for pupils. However, assessment is too often carried out in a way that creates unnecessary burdens for staff and pupils. It is therefore important that leaders and teachers understand its limitations and avoid misuse and overuse.</p>

<p>294.	Assessment should support the teaching of the curriculum, but not substantially increase teachers’ workloads by necessitating too much one-to-one teaching or overly demanding programmes that are almost impossible to deliver without lowering expectations of some pupils.</p>

<p>295.	Collecting data can also create an additional workload for leaders and staff. Inspectors will look at whether schools’ collections of attainment or progress data are proportionate, represent an efficient use of school resources and are sustainable for staff. The Teacher Workload Advisory Group’s report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response">‘Making data work’</a>, recommends that school leaders should not have more than 2 or 3 data collection points a year, and that these should be used to inform clear actions.</p>

<p>296.	Schools choosing to use more than 2 or 3 data collection points a year should have clear reasoning for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what interpretations and actions are informed by the frequency of collection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time taken to set assessments, collate, analyse and interpret the data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time taken to then act on the findings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>297.	We understand that assessment arrangements may have been altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will seek to understand how staff are supported and the steps that are being taken to remove the risk of additional workload. If a school’s system for data collection is disproportionate, inefficient or unsustainable for staff, inspectors will reflect this in the inspection report.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>298.	All schools should have a culture of safeguarding. This means they should have effective arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>always act in the best interests of children, pupils and students to protect them online and offline, including when they are receiving remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>identify</strong> children, pupils and students who may need early help, and who are at risk of harm or have been harmed. This can include, but is not limited to, neglect, abuse (including by their peers), grooming or exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secure the <strong>help</strong> that children, pupils and students need and, if required, refer in a timely way to those who have the expertise to help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>manage</strong> safe recruitment and allegations about adults who may be a risk to children, pupils, students and vulnerable adults</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>299.	Inspectors will not grade this aspect of a school’s work. However, inspectors will always make a written judgement under ‘leadership and management’ in the report about whether the arrangements for safeguarding children and pupils are effective.</p>

<p>300.	Inspectors must go beyond ensuring that schools meet statutory requirements, and beyond simply reviewing documents, to evaluate the safeguarding culture that has been established in the school.</p>

<p>301.	Inspectors will also ensure that proper arrangements are in place to share information appropriately with relevant parties, including forwarding information to schools and post-16 or post-18 providers.</p>

<p>302.	As well as understanding Ofsted’s inspecting safeguarding policies, inspectors will be familiar with the relevant guidance on safeguarding, including statutory guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education: statutory guidance for schools and colleges’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">‘Working together to safeguard children’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-environments-where-children-can-flourish">‘Positive environments where children can flourish’</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>303.	On all inspections, inspectors will determine whether there have been any safeguarding incidents or allegations since the last inspection, and whether the school has taken <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">appropriate action</a> to safeguard the children affected and/or deal with allegations.</p>

<p>304.	On a very small number of occasions, inspectors come across evidence or allegations of child abuse during an inspection. Inspectors must not attempt to investigate any incident of child abuse but will satisfy themselves that concerns about a child’s safety are referred, as appropriate, to the relevant local authority’s children’s services department. The referral will normally be made by the safeguarding lead for the school (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-concerns-guidance-for-inspectors">‘Safeguarding concerns: guidance for inspectors</a>. Inspectors must be satisfied that the correct referral has taken place and record this in their evidence base.</p>

<p>305.	If a child discloses to an inspector that they are suffering or at risk of abuse, the inspector will stop all other activity and focus on ensuring that the child receives the help they need. Specific guidance on what to do in this situation can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-concerns-guidance-for-inspectors">‘Safeguarding concerns: guidance for inspectors’</a>.</p>

<p>306.	The guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a> explains how incidents will be covered in the inspection report.</p>

<p>307.	Safeguarding is ineffective when there are serious or widespread failures in the school’s or setting’s safeguarding arrangements that give cause for concern because children are not protected and statutory requirements are not being met, or because insufficient action is being taken to remedy weaknesses following a serious failure of safeguarding arrangements.</p>

<p>308.	The following are examples of what ineffective safeguarding might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>safeguarding allegations about staff members are not being handled appropriately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children, pupils and students or particular groups of children, pupils and students do not feel safe in school or the setting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children, pupils and students have little confidence that the school or setting will address concerns about their safety, including risk of abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupils are frequently missing from school (including for part of the school day), but this is not addressed appropriately by staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incidents of bullying or prejudiced and discriminatory behaviour are common</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>309.	The school must provide opportunities for inspectors to speak to pupils with no other adults present, as it is important that pupils are able to express their views freely to inspectors. This is set out in our guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspectors-talking-to-pupils-on-inspection">‘Inspectors talking to pupils on inspection’</a>.</p>

<p>310.	If inspectors cannot corroborate the evidence that they gather about the effectiveness of the school’s arrangements to safeguard pupils, by talking to pupils during the inspection, then they will judge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>safeguarding as ineffective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the relevant independent school standards as not met</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>311.	If inspectors judge that standard 7 of the independent school standards is not met (for any reason; not solely if inspectors have not been able to talk to pupils), then they will judge safeguarding as ineffective.</p>

<h4>Allegations of sexual harassment, abuse or violence</h4>

<p>312.	Inspectors will not investigate allegations of sexual harassment, abuse or violence, but will ensure that allegations are reported to the appropriate authority.</p>

<p>313.	As set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a>, inspectors will consider how schools handle allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and violence, including whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff have appropriate knowledge of part 5 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff also have good awareness of the signs that a child is being neglected or abused, as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused--2">‘What to do if you’re worried a child is being abused’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all pupils are supported to report concerns about harmful sexual behaviour, and barriers that could prevent a pupil from making a disclosure, for example communication needs, are identified and addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff are confident and well trained in handling reports of sexual harassment, abuse or violence in line with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance, including incidents between children and those off school premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all allegations are taken seriously, comprehensively recorded and dealt with swiftly and appropriately, and pupils are confident that this is the case</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>314.	If schools do not have adequate processes in place, it is likely that safeguarding will be considered ineffective.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating leadership and management</h3>

<p>315.	Evidence used to evaluate the impact of leaders’ work, both currently and over time, includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meetings with leaders, including the proprietor, to discuss how well they know the school and the quality of education that it provides for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meetings with the proprietor and those responsible for governance as appropriate to evaluate how well they fulfil their statutory duties, including their duties under the Equality Act 2010 and in relation to safeguarding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documentary evidence provided by the school that demonstrates the effectiveness of the school’s provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interviews with staff and pupils to evidence how well leaders have created a positive culture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first-hand evidence gathered during the course of inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responses to the staff and pupil questionnaires and Ofsted Parent View; these will be particularly useful for judging the culture that has been established in the school by leaders and managers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any evidence the school has from regularly surveying its staff and the way in which leaders and managers have responded to concerns raised by staff or parents, for example about how senior leaders support teachers to tackle low-level disruptive behaviour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are unusual patterns of pupil movement, discussions with school leaders and the local authority about those movements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>316.	Inspectors will always report on the school’s activity to gather the views of staff, whether through its internal procedures or through it using the Ofsted questionnaire. They will do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="link">‘Information about this inspection’ section</a>.</p>

<h4>Inspecting alternative provision used by any type of independent school</h4>

<p>317.	Inspectors will evaluate how well a school continues to take responsibility for its pupils who attend alternative or off-site provision. Inspectors need to be assured that the proprietor has ensured that the alternative provision is a suitable and safe placement that will meet pupils’ academic/vocational/technical and, if appropriate, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> needs. Inspectors will speak to a selection of pupils who attend off-site provision, where possible, including through video/telephone calls.</p>

<p>318.	Inspectors must ask the school about the registration status of any alternative providers that they use. Any provider of alternative provision must be registered as an independent school if it caters full time for 5 or more pupils of compulsory school age, or one pupil who is looked after or has an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plan. If a school uses alternative provision that should be registered but is not, inspectors will carefully consider the likelihood that pupils are safeguarded effectively.</p>

<p>319.	Inspectors will normally visit a sample of any part-time unregistered alternative providers during the inspection, as directed by the relevant Ofsted region. This may be completed remotely. This is to assess the adequacy of the school’s quality assurance process. Inspectors will visit any registered alternative provision site that Ofsted has not yet inspected to assess the adequacy of the school’s quality assurance process.</p>

<p>320.	Inspectors will consider the quality of registered alternative provision using Ofsted’s latest inspection report and assess its impact on the overall quality of education for pupils in a proportionate way.</p>

<p>321.	Inspectors will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the reasons why the proprietor considered off-site provision to be the best option for the pupils concerned, and whether leaders have kept that under review</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the proprietor has made the appropriate checks on the registration status of the provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what safeguarding checks the proprietor has made and continues to make to ensure that the provision is a safe place for their pupils to attend</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which the proprietor ensures that the school’s pupils benefit from a well-planned and sequenced, well-taught, broad curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the attendance and behaviour of the pupils who attend the provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well the provision promotes the pupils’ personal development</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>322.	If a school uses a provider that is not registered, the inspector must contact the duty desk so that they can notify Ofsted’s unregistered schools team. Following the inspection, the team will determine if we need to take further action because there is reasonable cause to believe that the setting is operating as an unregistered school.</p>

<p>323.	A school is likely to be judged inadequate for leadership and management if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is making ineffective or inappropriate use of alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is using inappropriate alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proprietor has not taken the necessary steps to assure themselves of the suitability of a provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proprietor is not aware of how many of their pupils attend alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proprietor is not taking responsibility for their pupils who attend alternative provision</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Gaming</h4>

<p>324.	Inspectors will challenge leaders and managers about unusual patterns of examination entry that appear to ‘game the system’, for example if they are entering pupils for courses that are not in their educational best interest. If inspectors uncover evidence that deliberate gaming is taking place, the leadership and management judgement is likely to be inadequate.</p>

<p>325.	Inspectors will also challenge leaders and managers about unusual patterns in the way that the school records attendance, including the use of inaccurate register codes or changes to when the register is taken. For example, if inspectors reasonably believe that a school is inaccurately recording attendance, has changed the timing of session registration to game attendance rates or is using part-time timetables inappropriately, then inspectors are likely to judge leadership and management to be inadequate.</p>

<h4>Inclusion and off-rolling</h4>

<p>326.	Schools should have an inclusive culture that supports arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identify early those pupils who may be disadvantaged or have additional needs or barriers to learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the needs of those pupils, drawing on more specialist support when necessary, and help those pupils to engage positively with the curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that pupils have a positive experience of learning, and achieve positive outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure, during the pandemic, that pupils are returned to school as soon as is appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>327.	There is no legal definition of ‘off-rolling’. However, we define ‘off-rolling’ as:</p>

<p>The practice of removing a pupil from the school roll without a formal, permanent exclusion or by encouraging a parent to remove their child from the school roll, when the removal is primarily in the interests of the school rather than in the best interests of the pupil. Off-rolling in these circumstances is a form of <a class="govuk-link" href="#gaming">gaming</a>.</p>

<p>328.	When inspectors finds evidence of off-rolling taking place by our definition, they will always address this in the inspection report. They may, depending on the scale and impact, need to consider it when reaching the judgement. If a decision is lawful, but still meets our definition of off-rolling, inspectors must be careful to consider the context of the decision and the integrity of the leaders’ actions. They should be clear about what impact the off-rolling has had on pupils involved, and on the school. There are many different activities that can constitute off-rolling, so there can be no hard and fast rules as to how it should be addressed. However, if inspectors determine the school to be off-rolling according to our definition, then the leadership and management of the school are likely to be judged inadequate.</p>

<p>329.	There are reasons why a school might remove a pupil from the school roll, such as when a pupil moves house or a parent decides, without encouragement or coercion by the school, to home educate their child. This is not off-rolling. If the pupil transfers to the roll of their alternative provision, and this is genuinely in the best interest of the pupil, this is not off-rolling. If a school appropriately removes a pupil from the roll due to a formal permanent exclusion and follows the proper processes, this is not off-rolling. Headteachers have the right to exclude pupils when there are legitimate reasons for them to do so. Used correctly, exclusion is a vital measure for headteachers to use.</p>

<p>330.	Dual-registering or dual-coding a pupil in 2 schools or providers, or using alternative provision while they remain registered at the school, is not off-rolling because the pupil has not left the roll of their school. However, this may still be a form of gaming if it is not in the best interests of the pupil. Managed moves can be an effective tool in breaking a cycle of poor pupil behaviour, but they can also be a form of off-rolling. Managed moves are not off-rolling only when they are genuinely used in a pupil’s best interests, within the statutory guidance. If a school uses managed moves, inspectors may ask to see evidence of the ways in which these have been carried out.</p>

<p>331.	Inspectors will be interested if there are high numbers of pupils moving on- and off-roll, but this may not in itself mean that off-rolling is taking place.</p>

<h4>The impact of safeguarding on the leadership and management judgement</h4>

<p>332.	When safeguarding is ineffective, this is likely to lead to an inadequate leadership and management judgement. However, there may be circumstances when it is appropriate to judge a setting as requires improvement, rather than inadequate, if there are minor weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements that are easy to put right and do not leave children either being harmed or at risk of harm.</p>

<h2>Evaluating early years and sixth-form provision</h2>

<h3>Early years provision in schools</h3>

<p>333.	Inspectors are required to grade the standards of education and care in any early years provision in schools and to write about its effectiveness in the inspection report. Inspectors’ judgement on the effectiveness of early years provision includes evaluation of the provision for 2- and 3-year-olds. Inspectors should also note if any children receive additional funding.</p>

<p>334.	We recognise that the disruption to learning caused by the pandemic may have impacted on what children have learned. This could result in some children having a wider than usual range of starting points and gaps in their knowledge. Inspectors will pay close attention to how schools identify and address any of these delays and gaps and what the school is doing to address disruption to learning to ensure that children are well prepared for their next stage of education. Inspectors must use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a child in the early years provision, taking account of the ages of the children and whether they attend part time or full time.</p>

<p>335.	The effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding children is reflected in the main judgement for the school.</p>

<p>336.	Inspectors should take account of all the judgements made across the evaluation schedule. In particular, they should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders and staff plan, design and implement the curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which the curriculum and care practices meet the needs of the range of children who attend, particularly any children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the progress all children make in their learning and development relative to their starting points and their readiness for the next stage of their education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children’s personal, social and emotional development, including whether they feel safe and are secure, stimulated and happy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>337.	Inspectors will particularly consider the intent, implementation and impact of the school’s early years curriculum. They will evaluate the impact that the quality of education has on children, particularly the most disadvantaged and those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>338.	Inspectors will look at the children’s achievements at the end of Reception over time, by the proportions reaching a good level of development. However, inspectors need to get beyond the data as quickly as possible to ascertain how well the curriculum is meeting children’s needs. This will be evident in how well children know and remember more. Inspectors need to make careful inferences about children’s current progress by drawing together evidence from a range of sources.</p>

<p>339.	Inspectors will consider, taking into account any exemptions from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, how well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders assure themselves that the aims of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> are met and that it is sufficiently challenging for the children it serves. Staff ensure that the content, sequencing and progression in the 7 areas of learning are secured as appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the content of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> curriculum is taught in a logical progression, systematically and in a way that is explained effectively so that it gives children the necessary foundations for the rest of their schooling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children develop, consolidate and deepen their knowledge, understanding and skills across all the areas of learning in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff develop children’s communication and language through singing songs, nursery rhymes and playing games</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff develop children’s love of reading, through reading aloud and telling stories and rhymes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children demonstrate their attitudes and behaviours through the key characteristics of effective learning:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>playing and exploring</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>active learning</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>creative thinking and thinking critically</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>340.	Teaching should not be taken to imply a ‘top down’ or formal way of working. It is a broad term that covers the many different ways in which adults help young children learn. It includes their interactions with children during planned and child-initiated play and activities, communicating and modelling language, showing, explaining, demonstrating, exploring ideas, encouraging, questioning, recalling, providing a narrative for what they are doing, facilitating and setting challenges. It takes account of the equipment that adults provide and the attention given to the physical environment, as well as the structure and routines of the day that establish expectations. Integral to teaching is how practitioners assess what children know, understand and can do, as well as taking account of their interests and dispositions to learn (characteristics of effective learning), and how practitioners use this information to plan children’s next steps in learning and to monitor their progress.</p>

<p>341.	In addition, when observing provision for 2- and 3-year-olds, inspectors will consider the extent to which leaders and staff are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>knowledgeable about the typical development and characteristics of learning for 2- and 3-year-olds, including their emotional and physical dependence on adults</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aware of the large difference in development between children who are just 2 and those approaching their fourth birthday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responsive when children need comforting, and provide support appropriate to the individual needs of the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attentive to children’s care needs and use times caring for them as an opportunity to help children’s learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>giving children time to be in familiar, small groups and opportunities to be in smaller, quieter areas for play</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patient and attentive when allowing 2- and 3-year-olds to express their ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>listening to children and responding to their verbal and non-verbal communication rather than interrupting them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Independent schools with exemptions from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>
</h3>

<p>342.	Section 46 of the Childcare Act 2006 gives the Secretary of State the power to confer exemptions from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> in prescribed circumstances.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">[footnote 23]</a></sup></p>

<p>343.	All independent schools that have early years provision must deliver the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> in full, unless they have an exemption or have applied for an exemption through the independent schools route and meet the quality threshold.</p>

<p>344.	There are 2 routes for applying for an exemption: the independent schools route and the established principles route.</p>

<h4>Independent schools route</h4>

<p>345.	Registered independent schools that meet the 4 conditions below can take up an exemption from all of the learning and development requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Quality threshold – in the most recent standard inspection report the school must have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>a separate judgement of good or outstanding for the early years provision, or</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>met all the requirements in the standard in part 2, and the requirement in paragraph 2(2)(f) in part 1 of the independent school standards<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">[footnote 24]</a></sup></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other 3 conditions (seeking the views of parents, informing the local authority and notifying the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) are set out in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers">‘The early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) learning and development requirements: guidance on exemptions for early years providers’</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>346.	Exemptions will only be granted for pupils aged 3 and upwards; however, pupils who are ‘rising 3’ (that is, children who will turn 3 within the first term that they attend the school) should be treated in the same way as 3-year-olds.</p>

<p>347.	An exemption via the independent schools route is ‘taken up’ on the date that the school notifies the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, provided that it has met all the conditions. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will contact the school to confirm that it has received the notification.</p>

<h4>Established principles route</h4>

<p>348.	Some independent schools are governed by ‘established principles’ that cannot be reconciled with some or all of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements. Such schools can be granted exemption from some or all of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements via the established principles route, if they meet the following conditions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In their application to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, the school must explain why its established principles cannot be reconciled with one or more of the learning and development requirements. The school must set out how the early learning goals, educational programmes, or aspects of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> profile assessment conflict with its established principles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other 3 conditions (seeking the views of parents, informing the local authority and notifying the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) are set out in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-early-years-foundation-stage-eyfs-learning-and-development-requirements-guidance-on-exemptions-for-early-years-providers">‘The early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>) learning and development requirements: guidance on exemptions for early years providers’</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>349.	Under the established principles route, exemptions can be granted, and modifications can be made, against the learning and development requirements. These in turn may be classified as educational programmes, early learning goals and assessment arrangements.</p>

<p>350.	If an exemption is granted under the established principles route, it will take effect from the date of the letter from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> granting the provider exemption. During the period between applying and receiving the response, the school is not exempt from the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements.</p>

<h4>What happens after exemption?</h4>

<p>351.	Schools that have taken up an exemption must continue to meet the conditions. They must notify the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and the local authority if, after taking up an exemption, they cease to meet the conditions and therefore are no longer eligible for an exemption. Any school that is no longer eligible for an exemption will be required to re-introduce and meet the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>352.	Independent schools that take up full exemption from the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements can still practise in a way that meets the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements but they will be classified officially as exempt and will not be subject to local authority moderation.</p>

<h4>Before an inspection</h4>

<p>353.	During the on-site preparation, the lead inspector will ask the headteacher whether the school has, or has applied for, an exemption from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, and if so, whether the exemption is via the independent schools route or the established principles route and, if the latter, whether the exemption covers all or part of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements.</p>

<p>354.	If the school has applied for an exemption under the independent schools route and meets the quality threshold, the inspection will proceed as if the exemption has been granted.</p>

<p>355.	However, if the school has applied through the established principles route, and has not yet received a letter from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> granting the exemption, the school is not exempt from the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> learning and development requirements, and will therefore be inspected against them.</p>

<h4>On-site inspection activity</h4>

<p>356.	Where an independent school has an exemption (or has applied through the independent schools route and meets the quality threshold), <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> provision for children aged 3 and over will only be inspected against the independent school standards, rather than the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>357.	Exempted independent schools must continue to comply with the independent school standards for children aged 3 and over and the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> safeguarding and welfare requirements. The Childcare Act 2006 does not allow for any exemptions from the safeguarding and welfare requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>.</p>

<p>358.	Inspectors are likely to ask to see copies of letters granting exemptions via the established principles route.</p>

<h2>Sixth-form provision in schools</h2>

<p>359.	Inspectors are required to grade the quality of education in any sixth-form provision in schools and to write about the sixth form in the inspection report. Inspectors must use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a student in the sixth form.</p>

<p>360.	The effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding students is reflected in the main judgement for the school.</p>

<p>361.	Inspectors should take account of the key judgement areas in the evaluation schedule. They should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders and teachers have high expectations for attainment and progress and the effectiveness of the systems they use to monitor and develop the quality of sixth-form programmes for all students, including the most disadvantaged and those with high needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how leaders and teachers develop a curriculum that provides progression, stretch and challenge for those pupils who do not have GCSE mathematics and English at grades 9 to 4 (or legacy grades A* to C); this may also include opportunities for work experience or industry placements and non-qualification activities (which may include tutorials, work to develop study, leadership teamwork, self-management skills and volunteering)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effectiveness of high-quality, impartial careers guidance in enabling all students to make progress and move on to a higher level of qualification, employment or further training when they are ready to do so</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>362.	Through observing teaching and training activities and by holding discussions with students, teachers and support staff, inspectors will consider how well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>students develop personal, social and independent learning skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>students achieve high levels of punctuality and attendance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>students’ conduct and attitudes, including in non-qualification or enrichment activities and/or work experience, prepare them for employment or progress to higher levels of study</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>363.	Inspection of apprenticeships training and T-level technical education programmes are not in the scope of standard inspections of independent schools.</p>

<h3>Provision for students aged 19 and over</h3>

<p>364.	An independent school may have students aged 19 and over on roll. Inspectors will only inspect and take account of provision for these students if they began their studies before the age of 18. However, as these students are essentially adults studying alongside children, inspectors will always report on whether safeguarding is effective in this context.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">[footnote 25]</a></sup></p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Part 3. Grade descriptors</h2>

<p>365.	This part sets out the grade descriptors that inspectors will use in coming to judgements on standard inspections.</p>

<h2>Reaching a judgement</h2>

<p>366.	Inspectors will make 4 key judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>367.	Where relevant, inspectors will also make 2 provision judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>early years provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth-form provision</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>368.	Inspectors will also make a judgement on the school’s overall effectiveness.</p>

<p>369.	The grade descriptors are not exhaustive. They do not replace inspectors’ professional judgements. Inspectors will interpret the way that grades are described according to pupils’ age, stage and phase of education.</p>

<h2>Ofsted judgements</h2>

<p>370.	Inspectors use the following 4-point scale to make all judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grade 1: outstanding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 2: good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 3: requires improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grade 4: inadequate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>371.	Outstanding is a challenging and exacting judgement. In order to reach this standard, inspectors will determine whether the school meets <strong>all</strong> the criteria for good under that judgement, and does so securely and consistently.</p>

<p>372.	In other words, it is not enough that the school is strong against some aspects of the judgement and not against others, but it must meet each and every good criterion. In addition, there are further criteria set out under the outstanding judgement, which the school will also need to meet.</p>

<p>373.	When considering a judgement of good or requires improvement, inspectors will look at whether the overall quality of the school is most closely aligned to the descriptors set out.</p>

<p>374.	A school will be inadequate under a particular judgement if one or more of the inadequate criteria applies.</p>

<h3>Reaching judgements about schools with a specialist curriculum</h3>

<p>375.	In inspections of schools with a specialist curriculum, inspectors may not gather evidence for the quality of education judgement from the school’s specialist provision (see the section <a class="govuk-link" href="#specialist-curriculum">‘Schools with a specialist curriculum’</a>). However, they will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when reaching judgements in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>overall effectiveness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for quality of education</h2>

<p>376.	In order for the quality of education judgement to be outstanding, the school must meet all of the good criteria securely and consistently and it must also meet the additional outstanding criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school meets all the criteria for a good quality of education securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of education provided is exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum intent and implementation are embedded securely and consistently across the school. It is evident from what teachers do that they have a firm and common understanding of the school’s curriculum intent and what it means for their practice. Across all parts of the school, series of lessons contribute well to delivering the curriculum intent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work given enables pupils, over time and across the school, to consistently achieve the aims of the curriculum, which is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ work across the curriculum is consistently of a high quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils consistently achieve highly, particularly the most disadvantaged. Pupils with SEND achieve exceptionally well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>377.	In order to judge whether a school is good or requires improvement inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the inspection team’s professional judgement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders adopt or construct a broad, rich curriculum that is ambitious and designed to give all pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and pupils with SEND, the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life. Ofsted’s definition of this is a curriculum that is of comparable breadth and ambition to the national curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum may undergo necessary changes (for example, following a review by senior leaders or to take account of COVID-19) and certain aspects may be more developed than others. Where this is the case, these changes do not prevent all pupils having access to an appropriately broad and ambitious curriculum. Where adaptations to curriculum breadth are made for particular pupils, there is a clear rationale for why this is in those pupils’ interest, and, where appropriate, there is a clear plan for returning all pupils to studying the full curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment across a broad range of career options.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils study the full curriculum (as it is described in paragraph 2(2)(a) of the independent school standards); it is not narrowed. Where the school teaches a specialist curriculum, it also teaches the full range of subjects for as long as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum is successfully adapted, designed or developed to be ambitious and meet the needs of pupils with SEND, developing their knowledge, skills and abilities to apply what they know and can do with increasing fluency and independence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work given enables pupils to achieve the aims and ambition of the curriculum, which is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers have good knowledge of the subject(s) and courses they teach. Leaders provide effective support, including for those teaching outside their main areas of expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers present subject matter clearly, promoting appropriate discussion about the subject matter being taught. They check pupils’ understanding systematically, identify misconceptions accurately and provide clear, direct feedback. In so doing, they respond and adapt their teaching as necessary without unnecessarily elaborate or individualised approaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of study, teaching is designed to help pupils to remember long term the content they have been taught and to integrate new knowledge into larger ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any remote education is well integrated within course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers and leaders use assessment well. For example, they use it to help pupils embed and use knowledge fluently, or to check understanding and inform teaching, or to understand different starting points and gaps as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and do not use it in a way that creates unnecessary burdens on staff or pupils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers create an environment that focuses on pupils. The textbooks and other teaching materials that teachers select – in a way that does not create unnecessary workload for staff – reflect the school’s ambitious intentions for the course of study. These materials clearly support the intent of a coherently planned curriculum, sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading is prioritised to allow pupils to access the full curriculum offer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rigorous and sequential approach to the reading curriculum develops pupils’ fluency, confidence and enjoyment in reading. At all stages, reading attainment is assessed and gaps are addressed quickly and effectively for all pupils. Reading books connect closely to the phonics knowledge that pupils are taught when they are learning to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sharp focus on ensuring that younger children and those at the early stages of reading gain the phonics knowledge and language comprehension necessary to read, and the skills to communicate, gives them the foundations for future learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers ensure that their own speaking, listening, writing and reading of English support pupils in developing their language and vocabulary well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils develop detailed knowledge and skills across the curriculum and, as a result, achieve well. This is reflected in the work that pupils produce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where available, impact is reflected in results from examinations, or in the qualifications obtained. Teacher assessed grades from 2020 and 2021 will not be used to assess impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils are ready for the next stage of education, employment or training. They have the knowledge and skills they need and, where relevant, they gain qualifications that allow them to go on to destinations that meet their interests and aspirations and the intention of their course of study. Pupils with SEND achieve the best possible outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils read widely and often, with fluency and comprehension appropriate to their age. They are able to apply mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures appropriately for their age.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Requires improvement (3)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The quality of education provided by the school is not good.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<p>The quality of education is likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum has limited ambition, little or no structure or coherence, and leaders have not appropriately considered content and sequencing. Pupils experience a jumbled, disconnected series of lessons that do not build their knowledge, skills or understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pupils’ experiences in lessons contribute weakly to their learning of the intended curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The range of subjects is narrow and does not prepare pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of life in modern Britain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils cannot communicate, read, write or apply mathematics sufficiently well for their age and are therefore unable to succeed in the next year or stage of education, or in training or employment. (This does not apply for some pupils with SEND.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The progress that disadvantaged pupils make is consistently well below that of other pupils nationally and shows little or no improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils with SEND do not benefit from a good-quality education. Expectations of them are low, and their needs are not accurately identified, assessed or met.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils have not attained the qualifications appropriate for them to progress to their next stages of education, training or employment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>378.	In order for the behaviour and attitudes judgement to be outstanding, it must meet all of the good criteria securely and consistently and it must also meet the additional outstanding criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school meets all the criteria for good in behaviour and attitudes securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behaviour and attitudes are exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils behave with consistently high levels of respect for others. They play a highly positive role in creating a school environment in which commonalities are identified and celebrated, difference is valued and nurtured, and bullying, harassment and violence are never tolerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils consistently have highly positive attitudes and commitment to their education. They are highly motivated and persistent in the face of difficulties. Pupils make a highly positive, tangible contribution to the life of the school and/or the wider community. Pupils actively support the well-being of other pupils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils behave consistently well, demonstrating high levels of self-control and consistently positive attitudes to their education. If pupils struggle with this, the school takes intelligent, fair and highly effective action to support them to succeed in their education.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>379.	In order to judge whether a school is good or requires improvement, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the inspection team’s professional judgement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school has high expectations for pupils’ behaviour and conduct. These expectations are commonly understood and applied consistently and fairly. This is reflected in pupils’ positive behaviour and conduct. Low-level disruption is not tolerated and pupils’ behaviour does not disrupt lessons or the day-to-day life of the school. Leaders support all staff well in managing pupils’ behaviour. Staff make sure that pupils follow appropriate routines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders, staff and pupils create a positive environment in which bullying is not tolerated. If bullying, aggression, discrimination and derogatory language occur, they are dealt with quickly and effectively and are not allowed to spread.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is demonstrable improvement in the behaviour and attendance of pupils who have particular needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ attitudes to their education are positive. They are committed to their learning, know how to study effectively and do so, are resilient to setbacks and take pride in their achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils have high attendance within the context of the pandemic. They come to school on time and are punctual to lessons. When this is not the case, the school takes appropriate, swift and effective action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suspensions are used appropriately. The school reintegrates excluded pupils on their return and manages their behaviour effectively. Permanent exclusions are used appropriately as a last resort (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusion">statutory guidance on school exclusion</a>).</p>

<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<p>Behaviour and attitudes are likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders are not taking effective steps to secure good behaviour from pupils and a consistent approach to discipline. They do not support staff adequately in managing behaviour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ lack of engagement and persistent low-level and/or high-level wilful disruption contribute to reduced learning and/or disorderly classrooms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A significant minority of pupils show a lack of respect for each other and/or staff and a lack of self-discipline. Pupils frequently ignore or rebut requests from teachers to moderate their conduct. This results in poor behaviour around the school.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils show negative attitudes towards the value of good manners and behaviour as important factors in school life, adult life and work.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidents of bullying or prejudiced and discriminatory behaviour, both direct and indirect, are frequent.</p>

<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum extends beyond the academic, vocational or technical and provides for pupils’ broader development. The school’s work to enhance pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is of a high quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum and the school’s effective wider work support pupils to be confident, resilient and independent, and to develop strength of character.</p>

<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders adopt or construct a curriculum that is ambitious and designed to give children, particularly the most disadvantaged, the knowledge, self-belief and cultural capital they need to succeed in life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced. It builds on what children know and can do, towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for their future learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a sharp focus on ensuring that children acquire a wide vocabulary, communicate effectively and, in Reception, secure a knowledge of phonics, which gives them the foundations for future learning, especially in preparation for them to become confident and fluent readers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s approach to teaching early reading and synthetic phonics is systematic and ensures that all children learn to read words and simple sentences accurately by the end of Reception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school has the same academic ambitions for almost all children. For children with particular needs, such as those with SEND, their curriculum is designed to be ambitious and to meet their needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children benefit from meaningful learning across the curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff are knowledgeable about the areas of learning they teach. They manage the EYFS curriculum and pedagogy in relation to the learning needs of their children. Staff are expert in teaching systematic, synthetic phonics and ensure that children practise their reading from books that match their phonics knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff present information clearly to children, promoting appropriate discussion about the subject matter being taught. They communicate well to check children’s understanding, identify misconceptions and provide clear explanations to improve their learning. In so doing, they respond and adapt their teaching as necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff read to children in a way that excites and engages them, introducing new ideas, concepts and vocabulary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff are knowledgeable about the teaching of early mathematics. They ensure that children have sufficient practice to be confident in using and understanding numbers. The mathematics curriculum provides a strong basis for more complex learning later on. Over the EYFS, teaching is designed to help children remember long term what they have been taught and to integrate new knowledge into larger concepts. This is checked well by staff and leaders. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and avoid unnecessary burdens on staff or children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff create an environment that supports the intent of an ambitious, coherently planned and sequenced curriculum. The resources are chosen to meet the children’s needs and promote learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum and care practices promote and support children’s emotional security and development of their character. Staff teach children the language of feelings, helping them to appropriately develop their emotional literacy (see pages 8 to 9 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">‘Statutory framework for the early years foundation stage’</a>, which set out the personal, social and emotional development (PSED) area of learning). Leaders and staff are particularly attentive to the youngest children’s needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff give clear messages to children about why it is important to eat, drink, rest, exercise and be kind to each other. They teach children to take managed risks and challenges as they play and learn, supporting them to be active and develop physically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff provide information for parents about their children’s progress, in line with the requirements of the EYFS. They provide information to parents about supporting their child’s learning at home, including detail about the school’s method of teaching reading and how to help their children learn to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children develop detailed knowledge and skills across the 7 areas of learning in an age-appropriate way. Children develop their vocabulary and use it across the EYFS curriculum. By the end of Reception, children use their knowledge of phonics to read accurately and with increasing speed and fluency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children are ready for the next stage of education, especially Year 1 in school, if applicable. They have the knowledge and skills they need to benefit from what school has to offer when it is time to move on. By the end of Reception, children achieve well, particularly those children with lower starting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of Reception, children have the personal, physical and social skills they need to succeed in the next stage of their education. Most children achieve the early learning goals, particularly in mathematics and literacy.</p>

    <p>Children enjoy, listen attentively and respond with comprehension to familiar stories, rhymes and songs that are appropriate to their age and stage of development. Children develop their vocabulary and understanding of language across the 7 areas of learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children demonstrate their positive attitudes to learning through high levels of curiosity, concentration and enjoyment. They listen intently and respond positively to adults and each other. Children are developing their resilience to setbacks and take pride in their achievements.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixth-form students study the intended curriculum. The school ensures this by teaching all components of the full programmes of study. Any remote education is integrated into course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum. Changes may have been made to the intended curriculum to have a short-term specific focus for some or all students. Where this is the case, there is a clear rationale for why it is in those students’ best interests, and there is a clear plan for returning all students to studying to their full programme.</p>
  </li>

For example, they use it to help students embed and use knowledge fluently and flexibly, to evaluate the application of skills, or to check understanding and inform teaching or to understand different starting points and gaps as a result of the pandemic. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and do not use it in a way that creates unnecessary burdens on staff or students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers create an environment that allows sixth-form students to focus on learning. The resources and materials that teachers select and produce – in a way that does not create unnecessary workload for staff – reflect the school’s ambitious intentions for the course of study.

<h2>Grade descriptors for overall effectiveness</h2>

<p>387.	Inspectors will use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to attend the school. In making their judgements about a school’s overall effectiveness, inspectors will consider whether the standard of education is good or whether it exceeds good and is outstanding. If it is not good, then inspectors will consider whether it requires improvement or is inadequate.</p>

<p>388.	In judging the school’s overall effectiveness, inspectors will take account of the 4 key judgements.</p>

<p>389.	In coming to each of these key judgements, inspectors will also draw on evidence from the inspection of any early years provision or sixth-form provision and consider its impact in the wider context of the school.</p>

<p>390.	Inspectors will judge the effectiveness of any early years provision or sixth-form provision. For either case or both, inspectors will give a grade, summarise the key findings and explain the effectiveness grading in the inspection report. However, inspectors may decide not to give a grade and not to report on early years or sixth-form provision if there is the risk that it is possible to identify individual pupils because numbers are so small. Typically, this will be when there are fewer than 5 pupils.</p>

<p>391.	The grade for early years and/or the grade for the sixth-form provision may be the same as, or higher or lower than, the overall effectiveness grade. Inspectors will take into account the size of the early years and sixth-form provision in relation to the size of the school when considering the impact of these judgements on the overall effectiveness grade. Inspectors will explain any difference between the early years and/or sixth-form provision grade(s) and the overall effectiveness grades in the report.</p>

<p>392.	Inspectors will always make a written judgement about the effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding pupils.</p>

<p>393.	Before making the final judgement on overall effectiveness, inspectors will always consider the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils at the school, and evaluate the extent to which the school’s education provision meets different pupils’ needs, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>394.	Inspectors will assess a school’s entire provision, including any specialist provision offered, when reaching a judgement about overall effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Part 4. Inspecting against the independent school standards and other requirements</h2>

<h2>Technical information about the standards</h2>

<p>395.	The standards are set out in the schedule to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3283/contents/made" rel="external">Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014</a>. Since 2014, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has introduced minor amendments to the standards, most of which can be seen on the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.legislation.gov.uk">legislation website</a>.</p>

<p>396.	The standards are structured in 8 parts. Each part contains one or more standards relating to that particular part. For example, part 1 contains 3 standards, and part 2 contains one standard. Each standard is set out in one or more paragraphs. For example, paragraph 12 contains a standard in its own right, and paragraph 5(a) is an element of the standard in paragraph 5. Schools must comply with each requirement in each paragraph to meet the standard.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/156030/ISS_flowchart__Non-association_independent_school_handbook__July_2022_update.svg"></div></figure>

<p>397.	Inspectors check schools’ compliance with the requirements of the paragraphs of the standards. They report to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> on a school’s compliance with the standards, setting out which requirements of which paragraph the school does not meet.</p>

<h3>Recording compliance and non-compliance</h3>

<p>398.	In standard inspections, inspectors check compliance with all paragraphs of the standards, and record ‘met’, ‘not met’ or ‘not applicable’ in the ‘independent school standards compliance record’. For pre-registration inspections, inspectors report whether the school is likely to meet all of the standards should the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> decide to register it. In the rare case that it is not possible to gather sufficient evidence to make a secure judgement on whether a standard is met or likely to be met, inspectors will record ‘insufficient evidence’. On a standard inspection, this might happen where there are no pupils on roll, and in pre-registration inspections, in respect of the standard about teaching.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">[footnote 26]</a></sup></p>

<p>399.	In material change, emergency and progress monitoring inspections, inspectors only check compliance with the paragraphs of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/conducting-additional-inspections-of-independent-schools">the standards specified by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>400.	For all inspection types, where the requirement of a paragraph is not met and the paragraph is introduced by a stem, inspectors will record non-compliance with the stem itself, in addition to non-compliance with the specific paragraph, as illustrated in the examples below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where a school does not comply with paragraph 3(c), this means that it does not meet the standard contained in paragraph 3. Both paragraphs must be reported as not being met:</li>
</ul>

<p>3 The standard in this paragraph is met if the proprietor ensures that the 	teaching at the school –
3(c) involves well planned lessons and effective teaching methods, 	activities and management of class time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If paragraph 18(2)(c)(ii) is not met, inspectors will record non-compliance with 18(2)(c)(ii), 18(2)(c) (which contains the stem) and 18(2) (which contains the standard). All 3 paragraphs must be reported as not being met.</li>
</ul>

<p>401.	Where there are several elements to a paragraph of the standards, connected by ‘and’, all elements of the paragraph must be fulfilled for the requirement to be met. For example, paragraph 3(c) requires the proprietor to ensure that the teaching at the school ‘involves well planned lessons and effective teaching methods, activities and management of class time’. If the school fails to meet one element of a ‘multi-element’ paragraph, inspectors will record that the school does not comply with the whole paragraph, and record supporting evidence about the extent of non-compliance, for example explaining that effective teaching methods are not always used and the impact that this has on the pupils.</p>

<h3>Gathering and recording evidence</h3>

<p>402.	Inspectors consider each paragraph of the standards on its own. Particular strengths in one area of a school cannot be used to compensate for evidence that a standard is not met elsewhere.</p>

<p>403.	When inspectors judge that a school does not meet a requirement, they will record in the independent school standards compliance record and the inspection report that both the requirement of the particular paragraph of the standards, and the standard to which it relates, have not been met. For example, if paragraph 3(c) is not met, they will record that the standard in paragraph 3 is not met because the requirement in paragraph 3(c) is not met.</p>

<p>404.	Inspectors record their evidence to support the judgement that requirements and standards are not met in the evidence base. Evidence to support the judgement that standards are met is only recorded in the evidence base, not the inspection report.</p>

<p>405.	Inspectors will be clear in their feedback to schools, written evidence and the report about the evidence gathered that led to the judgement that a standard is not met. The evidence will be linked directly to the wording of the standard.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs of the standards where compliance is not recorded</h3>

<p>406.	Compliance is sometimes not recorded against paragraphs that provide information about other paragraphs in the standards. For example, in part 4, paragraphs 18(4)(a) to 18(4)(c) set out the instances when the checks specified in paragraphs 18(2)(d) to 18(2)(f) do not need to be carried out.</p>

<p>407.	Some paragraphs in part 4 – for example 20(1) to 20(5)(b)(iii) – set out the checks that the Secretary of State carries out in relation to a proprietor of an independent school.</p>

<p>408.	Some paragraphs provide an introduction to other paragraphs. For example, paragraph 1 states that the standards about the quality of education are contained in part 1.</p>

<p>409.	There is normally no action for inspectors to take in relation to these paragraphs.</p>

<h3>Definitions of terms used in the standards</h3>

<p>410.	Regulation 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3283/regulation/2/made" rel="external">Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014</a> provides the definition of some of the terms used in the standards.</p>

<h2>References made in the standards, other published resources for schools and technical notes</h2>

<p>411.	In checking compliance with the standards, inspectors will refer to the non-statutory <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">‘The independent school standards: guidance for independent schools’</a>. Although this document is non-statutory, its aim is to set out the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s understanding of the standards, provide supplementary guidance on best practice in complying with the standards and give additional detail in some areas for which questions are sometimes raised by schools.</p>

<p>412.	Inspectors may also refer to the published resources referred to below. The published resources include pieces of legislation, statutory frameworks of guidance, non-statutory guidance or departmental advice, as indicated in brackets below.</p>

<p>413.	Some of the resources referred to in paragraph 412 are statutory guidance, with which the standards require schools to comply. Other resources are good practice guides that are available to advise schools. Schools do not have to follow them. Inspectors will not deem a standard to be unmet only because the school has not followed exactly what is set out in a published non-statutory guidance document; these documents provide best practice in complying with requirements. They will be clear about how the evidence gathered – for example the school’s action, or inaction – means that the standard is not met. It is the standards that schools have to comply with, not non-statutory departmental guidance and advice.</p>

<p>414.	If appropriate, inspectors may also refer to the following Ofsted guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Groups of schools</h3>

<p>415.	The standards require schools to have and implement several policies. Some schools that are part of a group may have policies that are common to the group. This is acceptable to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, provided that the policies are tailored so far as needed to each individual school – for example, by giving contacts in relevant local authorities – and are fully implemented. If there are separate websites for the schools, the policies should be available on the schools’ websites. However, if there is only one website for the group, which is clearly identifiable as the only website for the schools, it is acceptable to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> that the policies are published there.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>416.	The school must meet all the requirements in paragraphs 2A(1)(a) to (g) in order to meet the standard in paragraph 2A(1), except paragraph 2A(1)(c), which only applies to academies.</p>

<p>417.	If an independent secondary school does not teach about lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships, it will not be meeting the expectations of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance, and will therefore not meet paragraph 2A(1)(d). It will also not meet the requirements to encourage respect for the protected characteristics in paragraph 2(2)(d)(ii) and paragraph 5(b)(vi).</p>

<h4>Paragraph 3(a)</h4>

<p>418.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s expectation set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-independent-schools">‘The independent school standards: guidance for independent schools</a> (non-statutory guidance) is that a child making ‘good progress’ is not just ‘getting by’ or ‘coasting’ but is being actively supported towards increased achievement by the teaching he or she receives. Meeting the requirement of paragraph 3(a) therefore requires that pupils in general and according to their ability, make good progress. An effective system to track pupil progress will help provide evidence for meeting this standard.</p>

<p>419.	The requirement in paragraph 3(a) of the standards is not the same as the criteria set out in Ofsted’s quality of education judgement.</p>

<h4>Paragraph 18(2)(b), 20(6)(a)(ii)</h4>

<p>427.	Under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/142" rel="external">section 142(1)(a) of the Education Act 2002</a>, the Secretary of State may direct that a person may not provide education at an independent school (legislation).</p>

<p>428.	The authority for making a prohibition order is section 141B(2) Education Act 2002 (as inserted by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/21/part/3/enacted" rel="external">section 8 of the Education Act 2011</a>. Any person that is subject to a prohibition order is prohibited from carrying out teaching work in an independent school (legislation).</p>

<p>429.	The Secretary of State may make a direction under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/section/128" rel="external">section 128 of the Education and Skills Act 2008</a> prohibiting an individual from taking part in the management of independent educational institutions in England (legislation).</p>

<h3>Checks on non-proprietor governors</h3>

<p>430.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s view is that any governor is part of the management arrangements for a school, even if they are not part of the proprietor body. Therefore, all governors must be subject to a section 128 prohibition from participation in management check (paragraph 18(2)(b)). This includes unpaid governors working on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>431.	Any governors who are paid by a school must also be subject to a <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> check (paragraph 18(2)(d)). The definition of ‘staff’ in regulation 2 of the independent school standards makes it clear that this includes people without a contract of employment.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">[footnote 27]</a></sup></p>

<p>432.	Paid governors should also be subject to a barred list check (paragraph 18(2)(a)) if they have regular unsupervised contact with the children. This will normally be the case.</p>

<p>433.	A <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> certificate with a barred list check is also required for any unpaid governors who are engaged in regulated activity. (This falls under paragraph 7 of the standards, but not paragraph 18(2)(a) or 18(2)(d) – the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s view is that unpaid governors do not fall into the definition of staff because they work on a voluntary basis.)</p>

<h3>Teaching prohibition orders and prohibition from management of independent schools orders</h3>

<p>434.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> wrote to all independent schools in May 2018 to set out the arrangements for making the checks in 18(2)(b) and 20(6)(a)(ii).</p>

The standard relating to checks for staff is only met provided that no-one works at the school in contravention of a teacher prohibition order issued by the Teaching Regulation Agency on behalf of the Secretary of State. This effectively means that schools need to make checks for such orders when appointing into teaching positions. If a school has not previously done so they should also check that no existing members of teaching staff are subject to such orders, which began to be made from April 2012. <br><br>3. The standard relating to checks is also only met provided that no-one works at the school in contravention of a direction made by the Secretary of State under s.128 of the Education and Skills Act 2008 barring an individual from taking part in the management of an independent school. This effectively means that schools need to make checks for such directions when appointing into management positions, either from outside the school or by internal promotion. <a class="govuk-link" href="#relevant-records">See paragraph 7</a> for information about the position of existing staff in management positions. <br><br>4. When a Disclosure and Barring Service check, which includes children’s barred list information, is made for any member of staff, details of any s.128 direction made by the Secretary of State will also be disclosed as part of that check. As <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> barred list checks can only be made if an individual is engaging in regulated activity, s.128 direction checks for all “management in independent schools” roles can also be made using the TRA’s Secure Access Portal via the Teacher Services’ web page. <br><br>What constitutes taking part in the management of an independent school?<br><br>5. Individuals taking part in ‘management’ are likely to include individuals who are members of proprietor bodies (including governors…), and such staff positions as: head teacher, any teaching positions on the senior leadership team, and any teaching positions which carry a department headship. Whether other individuals such as teachers with additional responsibilities could be prohibited from ‘taking part in management’ depends on the facts of each case – so schools may wish to check them anyway. For non-teaching staff, posts which are part of the senior leadership team are likely to be regarded as ‘management’ for the purposes of checking for the existence of a barring direction. However, whether non-teaching staff are ‘taking part in management’ depends on the facts of each case. All employed school staff who work regularly in the school during school hours may be regarded as being in ‘regulated activity’ for the purposes of these checks. <br><br>7. Except where a person is being promoted internally to a management post, it is not necessary to carry out checks for s.128 directions for existing staff or members of the proprietor bodies. If an individual already at a school is the subject of a s.128 direction, that would be taken up by the department with the school concerned. If an individual barred under s.128 occupies a management position at an independent school, then that may be grounds for removal of the school from the register of independent schools (s.119 of the Act), leading to closure. <br><br>15. Any enquiries about barring directions and section 128 should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:registration.enquiries@education.gov.uk">registration.enquiries@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>437.	The check in paragraph 18(2)(c)(iii) has been required by the independent school standards since 1 May 2007.</p>

<p>438.	The check in paragraph 18(2)(d) has been required by the independent school standards since 1 September 2003. Until 1 May 2007, an enhanced check was only required for staff regularly caring for, training, supervising or in sole charge of children. From 1 September 2003 to 30 November 2012, enhanced criminal records checks were performed by the Criminal Records Bureau. Since 1 December 2012, they have been carried out by the <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>.</p>

<p>439.	The check required in paragraph 18(2)(f) has been required by the independent school standards since 1 September 2003.</p>

<p>440.	Paragraph 18(3) sets out that the checks in paragraphs 18(2)(c) and, except where paragraph 18(4) applies, paragraph 18(2)(e) must be completed before a person’s appointment. However, 18(2)(c)(ii) – checks on medical fitness – should not be made before the person is appointed. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has issued the following advice to proprietors of independent schools.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">From 1 October 2010, in accordance with Section 60 of the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful for employers to ask health-related questions of applicants before job offer, unless the questions are specifically related to an intrinsic function of the work. This means that schools should no longer, as a matter of course, require job applicants to complete a generic health questionnaire as part of the application procedure. Independent schools are advised to review their existing practices to ensure they are complying with both the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 and Section 60 of the Equality Act. Schools may decide to ask necessary health questions after job offer. In any case, they should ensure that any health-related questions are targeted, necessary and relevant to the job applied for.</p>

<p>441.	Refer to paragraph 327 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education’</a> for information on checks for existing staff (as opposed to new staff).</p>

<h4>Suitability of all members of supply staff</h4>

<div class="example">
<p>Paragraphs to be checked by inspectors: 19(2) to (3).</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In order to meet paragraph 19(2)(a)(i)(aa), the checks in paragraphs 21(3)(a)(i) to (iv),(vii) and 21(3)(b) must have been made in respect of each member of supply staff appointed.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In order to meet paragraph 19(2)(a)(i)(dd), additional checks for the relevant countries must have been made by the employment business as appropriate, and written confirmation to that effect must be obtained from the employment business for any member of staff supplied by the business who has lived abroad.</p>

<p>There are some countries for which checks are not possible. The school should ensure that the employment business has considered this and notified the school accordingly. As with the UK checks already needed for supply staff, it will be for the school to decide whether to accept supply of the staff member, given the outcome of checks (or the lack of them).</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In order to meet paragraph 19(2)(d)(i), the ‘contract or other arrangements which the proprietor makes with any employment business’ must require the employment business to provide the notification from the employment business referred to in paragraph 19(2)(a)(i).</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<p>In order to meet paragraph 19(3), the certificate in paragraph 19(2)(a)(i)(bb) ‘must have been obtained not more than 3 months before the date on which the person is due to begin work at the school’, except where paragraph 19(4) applies.</p>
</div>

<h4>Suitability of proprietors</h4>

<p>442.	Paragraphs 20(3)(b)(i) to (iii) and 20(5)(b)(i) to (iii) set out the checks on proprietors that are carried out by the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>. Normally inspectors do not check compliance with these paragraphs. If there has been a recent change in the proprietor and it appears that the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has not been notified, the inspector will record this to inform the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Suitability of all members of the proprietor body</h4>

<p>443.	Where there is a proprietor body, the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> will only have checked the chairperson, and it is for the chairperson to carry out checks on other members of that body. Inspectors will ensure that all checks in 20(6) to 20(6)(c) have been carried out for all members of the proprietor body, with the exception of the chairperson.</p>

<p>444.	Refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#paragraph-18-2-b">paragraphs 18(2)(b) to 20(6)(a)(ii)</a> regarding the checks in paragraph 20(6)(a)(ii) of the standards.</p>

<p>Paragraph 20(6)(b) is treated as being complied with, where paragraphs 20(7) (pre-registration inspection) or 20(8) (standard inspection) apply.</p>
</div>

<h4>Single central record</h4>

<p>446.	The standards require the proprietor of the school to keep a ‘single central register’, (also known as a single central record). The single central record must show the information referred to in paragraph 21(3) to (7) (as applicable for the school) for staff, supply staff or a member of the body corporate or unincorporated that is the proprietor (but not the chair of the school).</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Paragraphs to be checked by inspectors: 21(1) to (7)(b).</p>

<p>Paragraph 32(1)(g) applies to standard, progress monitoring and emergency inspections (not pre-registration inspections, which are carried out under section 99 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, or material change inspections, which are carried out under section 162(4) of the Education Act 2002). However, under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1751/contents/made" rel="external">Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006</a>, independent schools are required to keep admission and attendance registers and make them available to inspectors during any type of inspection.</p>

<p>449.	In order to meet the standards in part 6, the school must provide the information specified in the paragraphs. The content and the quality of the information itself, or its implementation, do not influence compliance with the standards in part 6. These are covered by other parts of the standards. The only exceptions are where the school has provided information that is irrelevant to the requirement of the paragraph, or where the information is relevant but is significantly out of date.</p>

<p>450.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has confirmed that the requirement of paragraph 32(1)(a) and 32(1)(b) is met if a school has placed the information on the school’s website (where one exists) and has told parents that this is where it can be found. If a school does not have a website or has decided not to place a copy on its website, then it must make a copy available in the school, inform parents of its availability and provide the required information on request. Schools with boarding pupils frequently have additional information, such as a booklet for boarders, aimed specifically at boarders or their parents.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Paragraph 33(k). The reference to ‘an inspection under section 109 of the 2008 Act’ means that the school’s complaints procedure must reflect that ‘correspondence, statements and records relating to individual complaints’ (which must normally be ‘kept confidential’) must be shared with inspectors if requested on standard, progress monitoring or emergency inspections.</p>

</div>

<p>451.	If there are any unmet standards in parts 1 to 7 of the independent school standards, paragraphs 34(1)(a) and 34(1)(b) are also unmet, and so too is 34(1).</p>

<p>452.	The quality of leadership and management standard is not met automatically if all the other standards are met. The school must demonstrate that it can consistently meet standards.</p>
