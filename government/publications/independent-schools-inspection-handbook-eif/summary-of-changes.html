<p>This sets out changes we have made to reflect our inspection practice. It does not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity.</p>

<h2>July 2022 (for September 2022 version)</h2>

<p>Paragraph 3: Parts 2 and 3 of the handbook have been renamed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Part 2. Explanation of our judgements</li>
  <li>Part 3. Grade descriptors (previously the evaluation schedule and applying the EIF in different contexts).</li>
</ul>

<p>Paragraph 7 to 11: ‘Privacy notice’ heading renamed ‘Gathering personal information on inspection’. Information in this section has been updated to focus on inspectors’ powers to gather, use and store evidence.</p>

<p>Paragraph 12: New paragraph added to explain that Ofsted may carry out research as part of our inspection activities.</p>

<p>Paragraph 75: New paragraph on inspections of schools that appear to no longer be operating.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 76 to 82: Updated information on deferral and cancellation requests.</p>

<p>Part 1 (paragraph 83): Information in this section has been updated.</p>

<p>Paragraph 88 to 98: Information in this section has been re-structured and updated.</p>

<p>Paragraph 99: Updates to the information schools must provide by the start of the inspection and when inspectors arrive at the school.</p>

<p>Paragraph 108: Information in this section has been re-structured and updated.</p>

<p>Paragraph 131 to 133: New section added setting out how inspectors consider complaints as part of an inspection.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 136 to 142: Updated section on inspecting schools with no pupils on roll.</p>

<p>Paragraph 167 onwards: Information in this section has been re-structured and updated.</p>

<p>Paragraph 273: New paragraph clarifies impact of any unmet standards on the leadership and management judgement.</p>

<p>In the good grade descriptors for ‘quality of education’, we have removed the previous transitional arrangements and instead added a new grade descriptor to make it clear that we understand schools will change their curriculum and so some aspects will be more developed than others.</p>

<h2>February 2022</h2>

<p>Footnote 2, footnote 3 and paragraphs 229 to 231: clarification about transitional arrangements.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 59, 236, 253 and 313 to 315: updated to clarify Ofsted’s approach to harmful sexual behaviour and allegations of sexual harassment, abuse or violence.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 98, 101 and 103: revised to reflect that we will inform (rather than consult) the Department for Education if we grant a deferral.</p>

<p>Paragraph 105 to 109: relocated ‘Seeking the views of registered parents and other stakeholders’ to before ‘Pupils and staff questionnaire’ for better sequencing.</p>

<p>Paragraph 127 to 128 and 243: replaced ‘newly qualified teachers’ with ‘early career teachers’.</p>

<p>Paragraph 183: clarified how inspectors will gather evidence for the quality of education judgement in inspections of schools with specialist provision.</p>

<p>Paragraph 369: removed reference to ‘curriculum plans’.</p>

<p>Paragraph 386 to 394: changes to reflect Ofsted’s policy on inspecting boarding and residential special schools and schools registered as children’s homes.</p>

<h2>October 1 2021</h2>

<p>Added separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/aligned-inspections-of-schools-with-boarding-or-residential-provision-from-october-2021">guidance on aligned inspections of schools with boarding or residential provision</a> from October 2021.  This temporarily replaces the guidance in paragraphs 380 to 390 of the independent schools inspection handbook.</p>

<h2>September 2021</h2>

<p>Removed previous version of the handbook. The September handbook is now in force.</p>

<h2>June 2021 (for September 2021 version)</h2>

<p>This section outlines changes to inspection practice. This does not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity in how the framework is written.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 10 to 31: updated the ‘Inspection and the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic’ section to reflect that this now covers the transitional period, and made other minor changes for clarity.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 32 to 38: changes to reflect the current situation on <abbr title="Early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> requirements.</p>

<p>Paragraph 44: added to explain the impact of the pandemic on the inspection cycle.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 61 and 62: updated to clarify that inspection fees will be charged unless a deferral is granted in line with our deferral policy prior to the start of on-site inspection activity, or – in the case of pre-registration inspections – unless the school withdraws their application prior to being notified that an inspection will take place.</p>

<p>Paragraph 207: clarified that inspectors will take transitional provision into account.</p>

<p>Paragraph 220: clarified that nationally published data does not include teacher or centre assessed grades.</p>

<p>Quality of education – implementation ‘Good’ grade descriptor: clarification that leaders provide effective support including for those teaching outside their expertise. Clarification on those at the early stage of reading.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 305 to 309: added new section codifying Ofsted’s position on harmful sexual behaviour.</p>

<p>Leadership and management – ‘Good’ grade descriptor: clarification that vision and proactive management of staff needs to be maintained beyond recovery from the pandemic.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 359 to 362: clarified how settings with an <abbr title="Early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> exemption are inspected in teaching early reading.</p>

<h2>April 2021</h2>

<p>Changes and additions have been made throughout the handbook in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A new section on ‘Inspection during the COVID-19 pandemic’ has been included, covering how we will reflect the COVID-19 context and the disruption it has caused to all education providers when making judgements.</p>

<p>Another new section covers ‘Disapplication and modifications of the early years foundation stage’ to support early years providers and schools during the pandemic.</p>

<p>A new section sets out scenarios in which the <abbr title="Department of Education">DfE</abbr> may decide to bring forward a school’s next standard inspection, following an additional inspection, to update the school’s graded judgements.</p>

<p>Arrangements and timescales for publishing reports and handling concerns and complaints have been updated.</p>

<p>Sections on ‘Relationships and sex education’ and ‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics’ have been updated to reflect revised expectations in light of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The ‘Safeguarding’ section has been updated to clarify the impact on judgements if inspectors are prevented from talking to pupils on inspection. It also now clarifies that if the safeguarding requirements of the independent school standards are judged to be not met, safeguarding will be judged ineffective.</p>

<p>We have removed the criterion relating to compliance with the independent school standards (<abbr title="independent school standards">ISS</abbr>) from the overall effectiveness grade descriptors. Compliance with the <abbr title="independent school standards">ISS</abbr> impacts the leadership and management judgement, because it is the proprietor’s responsibility to comply with the standards. There is no change to the leadership and management judgement criteria.</p>
