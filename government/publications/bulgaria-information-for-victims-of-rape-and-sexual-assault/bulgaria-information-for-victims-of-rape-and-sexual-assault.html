<p>If you’ve been sexually assaulted it’s important to remember that it was not your fault. Rape and sexual assault is always wrong – no matter who commits it or where it happens. It is traumatic and it can affect you both physically and emotionally. Do not be afraid to get help.</p>

<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make informed decisions about whether and how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>seek medical advice and attention</li>
  <li>report to local police</li>
  <li>engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 112</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-sofia">British Embassy in Sofia</a> (+44 20 7136 6857). Embassy staff will be empathetic, and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</li>
  <li>contact Vselena Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) in Burgas on their 24 hour free call helpline 0800 18 017 or arrange a visit. Vselena is designed to be a comfortable place, providing a private space for examinations and counselling services</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Bulgaria</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you are in an area where there is a British embassy or consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you, where timing and location allow. You will always be able to speak to trained consular staff on the telephone 24/7.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British embassy or consulate on +44 20 7136 6857 and they can offer you consular support.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</li>
  <li>insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reporting the crime to the local police does not hold any risks for you. That is why the police work in co-operation with a number of crisis centres, shelters and the Vselena SARC in Burgas. Extramarital sex, homosexuality and use of alcohol are not considered criminal offences in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>In most large cities in Bulgaria, both male and female police officers who are trained in dealing with sexual assault cases are available. Those who are not fluent in English will be supported by an interpreter. In smaller towns, you may have to wait for an interpreter to arrive at the police station before you can give a full statement.</p>

<p>Should you wish to report the incident to the police, you may be asked to provide information about your identity and details of the incident, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if there was sexual intercourse (if yes, was it forceful)</li>
  <li>if you have sustained injuries</li>
  <li>description of the crime scene (time of incident, location, if known, vehicles, etc.)</li>
  <li>description of the attacker</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to report the incident to the police, we may be able to accompany you. If you prefer to be interviewed by a female police officer we can request that from the local authorities. We can also provide details of local lawyers and interpreters. However, only you can decide if you want to take legal action: we cannot make this decision for you. Whatever you choose, we will support you.</p>

<p>You will not be asked to surrender your passport while the investigation is carried out.</p>

<h3>Lawyers</h3>

<p>You can appoint a lawyer for yourself at any time. Normally, if you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=bulgaria" rel="external">hire a private lawyer</a>, they are likely to ask for a cash advance on their estimated legal fees before they take your case on. The British embassy cannot pay legal fees or guarantee to a lawyer that you will pay them.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford a private lawyer, one will be appointed for you by the State. This will be free of charge but public defenders rarely speak English.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Bulgaria</h2>

<p>The British embassy will be able to help you. This includes helping you to contact your insurance company, your family, making arrangements to travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK.</p>

<p>You can find a list of:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bulgaria-list-of-medical-facilities">English-speaking medical facilities</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=bulgaria" rel="external">English-speaking lawyers</a></li>
  <li>translators</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on location and timing, a member of consular staff may be able to accompany you</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can also report the incident to them and ask them for assistance. If you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is your choice whether to report the crime. If you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated</li>
  <li>if you don’t report it immediately but decide to report at a later stage, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence</li>
  <li>if you decide not to report the crime to the local police, you will still be able to get medical assistance locally. Depending on the choice of the medical facility, charges for the forensic examination may apply</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>The support available to you, and your access to justice may vary according to where you report the crime. In many countries, you need to report the crime before you leave the country, if you want it to be investigated and police to obtain important evidence.</p>

<p>If you are staying in the country where the crime took place, you should report the crime in that country. If you are a British national and you need help to report the crime, you can contact the nearest <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a>, or the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London</p>

<p>If you do not report the crime in the country where it happened and you return to the UK, you can still report the matter to your local UK police.  The UK police should send the information you provide to the country where the crime happened.  However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action.</p>

<p>You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in the country where it happened. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Bulgaria: next steps</h2>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence.</p>
</div>

<p>If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts and social media messages</p>

<p>You will be expected to give a full statement about the incident, including giving a description of the attacker, the crime scene and all the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>tell the police if you think you have been drugged</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>insist you get a police report, and request a translation in English if applicable</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DNA evidence from sexual assault can be collected from the crime scene, but it can also be collected from your body, clothes, and other personal belongings. You may want to bring a spare change of clothes with you to the police station as the clothing you wore during the incident will be kept by the police as forensic evidence.</p>

<p>If you choose to have a forensic medical examination, the police will take you to the nearest hospital where the examination will take place.</p>

<p>Local police will not inform UK police about the crime.</p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>The medical examination is carried out by a qualified forensic physician only in hospitals with a forensic unit. Therefore, you may be referred to another medical establishment if necessary.</p>

<p>If the forensic examination is carried out through a police referral, the results of the tests will be automatically reported to the investigating officer who will inform you of the outcome. If the police haven’t been involved at this stage, the forensic physician will send the results directly to you.</p>

<p>The aim of the examination is to collect and document evidence. This may include documenting your general health, including menstrual cycle (where appropriate), potential allergies and pregnancy status; trauma assessment; taking fingernail clippings or scrapings; taking samples for sperm or seminal fluid; collection of bloody, torn, or stained clothing; taking samples for blood typing, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and DNA screening.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can ask them to accompany you to the hospital. If you want, we may be able to come with you as well (depending on timing and location). We can help you deal with the local authorities in arranging a medical examination, where possible with a female doctor if you prefer. We can also arrange for you to see a doctor who can give advice on sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, pregnancy, abortion or emergency contraception (the morning after pill). We can provide a list of local hospitals and English-speaking doctors.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The post-exposure prophylaxis treatment that can prevent HIV infection (HIV PEP) is not available in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you can purchase emergency contraception from any licensed pharmacy without prescription or medical referral. Prices may vary.  Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the forensic examination will be carried out for free if it is done through a police referral. If there is no police investigation and you wish to be forensically examined, the cost will be 60 BGN or approximately £30</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you have had medication administered overseas, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Police investigations in Bulgaria: what to expect</h2>

<p>Although it is not mandatory, you may be asked by the police to return to the scene of the crime or where you believe the attacker is located. Please note that your wellbeing and safety are of utmost importance to the police so if you consider returning to the crime scene a traumatic experience, you will not be expected to do so.</p>

<p>In the first stage of the investigation you will be presented with a list of people from the sex offenders register in order to try and identify the attacker. Throughout the investigation, however, if a suspect is brought to the police station you may be asked again to make identification.</p>

<p>If a suspect is brought to detention, it may last up to 72 hours. This time is used by the police to gather enough evidence to present to the observing prosecutor for the suspect to remain under arrest. If there is not enough evidence present or the suspect received a temporary measure instead of detention, the suspect will be released and summoned before the police and the prosecutor only after the necessary evidence is gathered.</p>

<p>In the pre-court proceedings you will not be expected to make a statement in front of the public prosecutor. Your initial statement will be taken at the police station and the investigating officer will communicate it to the observing prosecutor. After the investigation has been concluded, the prosecutor will file your statement to the criminal court and thus initiate a criminal court case; please note you will be allowed to receive copies of all case materials with the written agreement of the prosecutor. You may consider contacting a qualified lawyer at any stage of the investigation to get legal advice and representation if the case goes to court. Some of them may offer an initial pro bono service but please note the disclaimer.</p>

<p>You will not face any travel restrictions once the case is filed with the police, and you will be allowed to leave the country at any point.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>If a suspect is ordered to trial you may be asked to testify in court. You will be given the option to testify from the UK using a video conferencing tool.</p>

<p>If you haven’t appointed a lawyer, you will be kept informed of the case development by the investigating officer. If you wish all correspondence to be sent to another person, this should be mentioned to the investigating officer in the initial stage of the investigation.</p>

<p>Depending on the circumstances, the case may be referred back to the police for further investigation. There may be occasions when you will be expected to give an additional statement.</p>

<p>According to Bulgarian legislation, the charge of rape requires mandatory state prosecution which cannot be dropped.</p>

<p>The alleged assailant may press counter charges claiming false allegations. The competent authorities will review the charges separately.</p>

<p>You can usually apply for compensation if you have been injured because of a violent crime in another country. You should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-crime-abroad">EU Compensation Assistance Team</a> to apply for compensation.</p>

<h3>Trial procedures</h3>

<p>You will be informed about the next stages of the pre-trial and court proceedings by the investigation authorities – the prosecutor and the police. The trial will be conducted in Bulgarian language and an English-speaking interpreter can be appointed by court.</p>

<p>Failure to be present at every court session will not be considered an obstacle to the court hearing. Your legal representative, if you decide to appoint one, will attend the court hearings on your behalf.  If you are summoned to attend a trial in Bulgaria, the local authorities will not be able to assist with travel or accommodation arrangements. Their level of support is strictly administrative – issuing case reports, providing documentary services and etc.</p>

<p>Your case should be forwarded to a prosecutor within two months from the date you report the incident to the police. Throughout the investigation, the prosecutor may request an extension in order to gather additional evidence, however this extension cannot exceed two months.</p>

<h3>Hiring a lawyer</h3>

<p>A privately-hired lawyer can support and represent you at any stage of the criminal proceedings, can file applications and receive notifications on your behalf.  Lawyers who specialise in rape and sexual assault cases are not common in Bulgaria. You may be referred to a lawyer who has more experience in dealing with such cases.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers&amp;country=bulgaria" rel="external">find a list of English-speaking lawyers in Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<h3>Updates about your case</h3>

<p>Your lawyer as well as the investigating authorities will communicate with you throughout all stages of the investigation and trial. The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOI) has authorised investigating officers and victim support organisations to notify you of your rights. The observing prosecutor also ensures that the investigating authorities provide all this information throughout the criminal proceedings.</p>

<p>You will need to provide a local address but if you are not resident in Bulgaria, you can use your lawyer’s address. If you have not appointed a local lawyer and you have no residential address in Bulgaria, the proceedings will continue without your participation.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to appoint a lawyer, you can get regular updates from the investigating officer or the observing prosecutor.</p>

<h3>Legal aid</h3>

<p>You may be entitled to legal aid. You can send your application to the National Legal Aid Bureau or to the court. The conditions of the Legal Aid Act and the conditions of being unprivileged are means tested.</p>

<p>Legal aid covers lawyer’s fees. You will not be charged for the legal service before or after the case goes to court.</p>

<h3>Sentencing</h3>

<p>Sentences depend on the gravity of the case and the personality of the accused perpetrator.</p>

<p>The perpetrator would be guilty of ‘offence against morality’ and ‘crime against the person’.</p>

<p>Depending on the severity of the case, judges are able to pass down the following sentences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>imprisonment of 2-8 years</li>
