<p>The UK and Spain are major business partners. Total trade in goods and services (exports plus imports) between the UK and Spain was £34.2 billion in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2021, making Spain the UK’s ninth largest trading partner.</p>

<p>The UK is the largest European investor in Spain (FDI stock) with £84 bilion in 2020.</p>

<p>The latest Business Barometer report from the British Chamber of Commerce (November 2021) estimates that British companies are responsible for 227,000  direct and indirect jobs in Spain. Spain is the tenth largest investor in the UK (FDI stock) with £49 billion worth of investment in 2020.  Key Spanish companies such as Ferrovial, Iberdrola, FCC, Inditex and Santander all have significant operations in the UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political overview</h2>

<p>Spain is a member of the EU, WTO, OECD,  OSCE and Council of Europe and permanent guest at the G20. The Constitution of 1978 established Spain as a parliamentary monarchy with a multi-party democracy. Executive power resides with the government (elected every four years) presided over by the Prime Minister while legislative power sits with the bi-cameral Parliament, made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.</p>

<p>The 3-tier political system (comprising central, regional and local government) makes Spain one of the most de-centralised states in Europe. While the centre sets the broad parameters, the country’s 19 devolved administrations are responsible for the provision of basic public services including health, education and social services, and have significant influence over the regulatory environment for business.</p>

<p>Over the last thirty years there has been an increase in the number of services provided by regional and local governments, although that central-regional balance has come under pressure as revenues have tightened. The municipal tier of government also plays a key role. The 50 county councils, and 8,000 plus town halls account for c.13% of all spending and are responsible for delivering a wide range of public services (e.g. waste collection).</p>

<p>The last general elections were held in November 2019, following inconclusive elections in April 2019.  The centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) again won the most votes, but fell short of the 176 needed for an absolute majority, with 120 of the 350 seats. The PSOE established a minority coalition government, together with the left-wing party Unidas Podemos, and with parliamentary support from smaller regional parties.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Economic overview</h2>

<p>Spain is the fourth largest economy in the EU and, before the current economic crisis precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic, one of the fastest growing in the euro area. The economy has historically been boosted by UK tourists (18 million visits in 2019 from the UK) and UK residents (over 400,000 residents registered in Spain as of June 2021), especially in coastal areas.</p>

<p>Spain is one of the advanced economies hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, with 2020 GDP falling 11%. The economy rebounded by 5% in 2021, but GDP may not recover to pre-crisis levels until late 2022. Public finances remain under pressure as a legacy of the global financial crisis and as a result of economic support measures to combat the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>The government’s package of support measures focused on preserving employment and avoiding firm bankruptcies. This included a furlough scheme, support for the self-employed, and a state-backed loan guarantee scheme administered via the banking sector.</p>

<p>The government published its economic recovery plan in October 2020, to guide the execution of around €140 billion from the Next Generation EU recovery fund. The plan commits to spending at least 37% of the funds on green and climate related projects and 33% on digital transformation.</p>

<p>The investment plan is complemented by a series of structural reforms agreed the European Commission. Reforms that aim to maintain the purchasing power of the pension system and to address high unemployment and temporality of contracts in the labour market have been passed. Further measures are expected to address the sustainability of the pension system and make adjustments to the tax system.</p>

<p>Previous administrations undertook deep structural reforms in various areas, including some measures that have been particularly welcomed by British companies. For instance, legislation now requires public administrations to pay bills within 30 days and private companies to pay bills within 60 days (both as yet only partly successful). There have also been moves to facilitate outsourcing of the delivery of public services.</p>

<p>One of the most important reforms for businesses operating in Spain has been the introduction of the Single Internal Market Law, now up and running, which aims to iron out market inconsistencies between regions and make it easier to set up and trade in Spain. Companies that encounter internal market barriers within Spain now have online access to a central government-led resolution mechanism that ensures regulation at regional government level (which can differ between regions) does not interfere with the domestic single market.</p>

<p>The reform of the public and local administration has included the removal of administrative duplications (e.g. regional ombudsmen or weather prediction services), elimination of bureaucratic procedures (e.g. simplified “express” licences for small businesses), centralised services, and pooling of resources and services among smaller local authorities.</p>

<p>Spain’s headline rate of corporation tax is 25%. From 2022 there is a new minimum corporate income tax of 15% (10% for newly created companies, whose general rate is 15%). The minimum tax applies to corporations with a net turnover of €20 million or more and those that pay tax under the consolidated tax regime, regardless of the amount of their turnover.</p>

<p>In 2021 the Spanish government introduced new investment screening measures for direct foreign investments. Non-EU and non-EFTA investors must be authorised before they can invest more than €1 million in specific strategic sectors when the investment would amount to at least 10% of the Spanish company’s capital or mean that the investor participates in the management of the firm. This measure also temporarily applies until the end of 2022 to certain investments from EU and EFTA investors.</p>

<p>In terms of areas for improvement, UK companies in Spain have cited the need for improvements to the judicial system (in terms of speed and predictability of decisions), regulatory burden, and R&amp;D incentives. Political uncertainty at a national and regional level is also cited as an area of concern by UK businesses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Human rights</h2>

<p>Spain is signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

<p>Spain is a strong supporter of gender equality and same sex marriage has been legal in Spain since 2005. The four human rights pillars in Spain’s external action strategy 2021-24 are people; feminism; diversity and human trafficking.</p>

<p>In addition to these, the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Portal/en/PoliticaExteriorCooperacion/DerechosHumanos/Paginas/inicioHR.aspx" rel="external">Spanish MFA states</a> that other priorities are the fight against the death penalty (the Secretariat of the International Commission against the Death Penalty has its headquarters in Madrid); non-discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation; rights of persons with disabilities; the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; and business and human rights. Moreover, in a cross-cutting manner, Spain is currently in the process of joining the Global Media Freedom Coalition and special attention is paid to human rights defenders, for whom there is a temporary shelter programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal.  It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or as Scottish partnership to bribe anywhere in the world.  In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national or resident in the UK or a body incorporated or formed in the UK.  In this case, it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Organised crime</h2>

<p>As in many other major European countries, international organised criminal activity takes place in parts of Spain, in particular linked to drugs and firearms trafficking and organised immigration crime. There has been government action to tackle these issues and the UK and Spain work closely together in this area.</p>

<p>There have been complaints about scams, often related to lottery prizes and inheritances, in which a person receives what appears to be an official notification from a Spanish government department or lawyer and are required to make advanced payments or deposit sums in a bank account.</p>
