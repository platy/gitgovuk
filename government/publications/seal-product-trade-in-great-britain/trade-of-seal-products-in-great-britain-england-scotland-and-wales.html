<p>The UK government shares the British public’s high regard for animal welfare and will retain the legislation banning the importation of seal products.</p>

<p>The inhumane nature of seal hunting practices in certain parts of the world caused considerable concern to members of the public, animal welfare organisations, non-government organisations,&nbsp;and governments.</p>

<p>Controls on seal (pinnipeds) products are enforced in Great Britain by the Seal Products Regulations 2010 and retained Council Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 (as amended). Retained Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1850 (as amended) lays down detailed rules for implementing retained Regulation 1007/2009.</p>

<p>The regulations introduced a ban on commercially importing and marketing all seal products and any related products. This includes products from seals, walruses and sea lions (for example, fur skin pelts, clothing and accessories).</p>

<p>The trade ban applies to seal products produced in Great Britain and to imported seal products unless they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>result from traditional hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities and contribute to their subsistence</li>
  <li>are exclusively for the personal use of travellers or their families and only occasionally imported</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the exemption for traditional hunts by Inuit and other indigenous communities, the seal product must be supported by a seal catch attestation (certificate). This must be issued by the relevant recognised authorities where the pinniped was killed.</p>

<p>Customs authorities in Great Britain will check and certify these documents. Territories or countries that are qualified to provide these attestation documents are called recognised authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Countries and territories authorised to export seal products to Great Britain</h2>

<p>Currently there are 3 recognised authorities for the export of seal products to Great Britain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greenland Department of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture</li>
  <li>Government of Northwest Territories of Canada</li>
  <li>Department of Environment, Government of Nunavut</li>
</ul>

<p>These authorities are approved to issue attesting compliance documentation through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retained Commission Decision of 26 October 2015 for The Greenland Department of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture</li>
  <li>Retained Commission Decision (EU) 2017/265 of 14 February 2017 for the Government of Northwest Territories of Canada</li>
</ul>

<p>Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/2125 of 16 December 2020 recognised the Government of Nunavut as a recognised authority following its name change from the Department of Environment, Government of Nunavut. The UK government is in the process of recognising this name change for Great Britain. The Department of Environment, Government of Nunavut continues to be recognised during this process.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Additional bans on seal products</h2>

<p>The seal product ban is in addition to the Import of Seal Skins Regulations 1996.  The 1996 regulations prohibit the commercial importation of whitecoat pups of species:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phoca (Pagophilus)</li>
  <li>groenlandica (harp seal)</li>
  <li>Cystophora cristata (hooded seal)</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes raw, tanned or dressed fur skins and any products made from, or including the fur skin of these seals.</p>

<p>This prohibition does not apply to products resulting from traditional hunting by the Inuit people and other indigenous communities.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland follows the comparable EU regime for seal products under Article 5(4) and Annex 2 of the Northern Ireland Protocol.</p>
