<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>General points on testing</h2>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) does not accredit or advise on individual coronavirus (COVID-19) point of care testing devices or platforms, but has contributed to and led Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) commissioned evaluations of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/lateral-flow-devices-results" class="govuk-link">specific devices</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4262" class="govuk-link">published relevant findings</a>.</p>

<p>There are a different types of test for COVID-19. They are not interchangeable, and care should be taken with terminology.</p>

<p>The results of COVID-19 tests that detect different parts of the virus or immune response provide different clinical information that often overlaps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nucleic acid tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests, indicate whether there is viral <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> present in the tested specimen. The majority of those with positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results are infectious but the <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> of the virus can persist in some individuals for many weeks and therefore a repeat <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is not recommended within 90 days in someone whose symptoms have resolved</li>
  <li>coronavirus virus protein antigen tests such as lateral flow devices  for antigens (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr>) indicate whether a person has the virus now and is likely to be infectious to others</li>
  <li>tests for coronavirus antibodies (antibodies produced by the patient in response to the infection) are performed on  blood sent to a laboratory or by dropping a fingerprick blood specimen into an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> test for antibodies (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> Ab)</li>
</ul>

<p>A point of care (<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>) test provides a result near to the person being tested, instead of sending their specimen to a laboratory. A <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test may be used within a healthcare setting, or in other settings such as a residential care home, a school, or in a person’s home. Generally, results from <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> testing are much more rapid than traditional laboratory testing.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of  <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> testing that mirror the other types of testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests that detect viral genomic material through amplification. These tests are similar in sensitivity to laboratory-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests which detect viral protein, such as <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests. These are less sensitive compared to a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for detecting virus at a lower viral load, such as at the start of an infection, but are very good at detecting infectious virus later in the infective episode.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests that detect antibodies against the coronavirus (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> Ab)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) has published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-patients-the-public-and-professional-users-a-guide-to-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits" class="govuk-link">guide to COVID-19 tests and testing kits</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Types of testing available and recent evaluations</h2>

<p>The standard <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for current infection is performed on machines by expert laboratory staff in a central laboratory. Other nucleic acid based tests use portable devices to provide rapid testing outside a laboratory. A list of all validated technology and their validation reports is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-serology-and-viral-detection-testing-uk-procurement-overview#products-in-the-pipeline-tvg" class="govuk-link">available</a>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test uses a colour change on a test strip, to directly detect non-nucleic acid antigens of coronavirus.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test sensitivity varies with viral load. When used for regular testing of asymptomatic people they are effective at identifying people with the virus when <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lateral-flow-device-performance-data">they are at their most infectious</a>. Test sensitivity is around 88% for nasal-only swabs and 92% for throat and nose at high viral load, independent of whether administered by experienced or inexperienced users. An <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">initial laboratory evaluation of the <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests for COVID-19</a> in current use in the UK, showed that these devices have similar sensitivity for detecting Omicron, the newest variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to previous strains of SARS-CoV2.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00204-2/fulltext#coronavirus-linkback-header">Validation experiments</a> performed by the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and academics from the University of Oxford estimated a high specificity of the Innova <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen test of 99.7%. However, analysis of real-world positivity rates for the Innova <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> devices found the specificity of these devices to be greater than 99.97%.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody tests have also been developed. These indicate whether a person has had infection with COVID-19 at some point in the past, but cannot diagnose current infection. They can also not yet detect vaccine-derived antibodies.</p>

<p>Many <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests are now available and there is great variation in their performance. When compared with laboratory <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> antibody tests, the most promising <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody tests have so far shown to be less sensitive (<a rel="external" href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-139" class="govuk-link">study 1</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4262" rel="external">study 2</a>).</p>

<p>There are postal self-sampling kits used in various circumstances such as for returning travellers, and in some care settings. These self-sampling kits are used by someone to take their specimen and return it to a central laboratory for testing; the samples can be tested by a variety of testing techniques depending on the purpose and laboratory that processes the swab.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Relevant regulations and guidance</h2>

<p>A COVID-19 <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test must have a valid <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking" class="govuk-link">CE mark</a> to ensure its design and manufacture achieves the performance specified for its purpose and is safe to use.</p>

<p>Obtaining a CE mark includes preparation of ‘Instructions for Use’ that specify whether a test should be performed by a trained professional or may be done by a lay person.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has provided specific guidance on how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-declare-as-a-private-sector-covid-19-testing-provider" class="govuk-link">self-declare as a private COVID-19 testing provider</a>. Following registration with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>, the manufacturer places a CE mark on the product, thereby declaring that the test meets the required legal criteria.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/371800/In_vitro_diagnostic_point-of-care_test_devices.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> guidance</a> on the principles to be followed for the management and use of <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test devices emphasises that the local hospital laboratory should play a key role in developing and supporting a <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> testing service.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr>) has provisionally classified SARS-CoV-2 as a Hazard Group 3 (<abbr title="Hazard Group 3">HG3</abbr>) pathogen. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-guidance-for-clinical-diagnostic-laboratories/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-handling-and-processing-of-laboratory-specimens#section9" class="govuk-link">Interim guidance</a> has been issued for the safe handling and processing of specimens from patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19. It specifies that <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests should only be used if a proper risk assessment has been performed.</p>

<p>From December 2020, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1549/introduction/made" rel="external" class="govuk-link">2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus, Testing Requirements and Standards) (England) Regulations</a> require all private coronavirus test providers to be engaged with the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>), and to have achieved <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation for coronavirus testing, no later than June 2021. Also, coronavirus testing is now exempted as a regulated activity under the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111117613/contents">Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The Health Protection Regulations have been amended to require the reporting of positive, indeterminate, negative and void COVID-19 and influenza test results by <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> service providers. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-and-influenza-point-of-care-testing-results-how-to-report" class="govuk-link">reporting guidance</a> for further information. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season" class="govuk-link">Weekly surveillance reports</a> are published on the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> webpage.</p>

<p><abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has issued an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-exceptional-use-authorisation-for-nhs-test-and-trace-covid-19-self-test-device">exceptional use authorisation</a> to <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to allow the use of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> testing of asymptomatic people. <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests are available for free to anybody through online ordering or pharmacy collect.</p>

<p>Detailed <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing guidance and toolkits, including standard operating procedures and instructional videos, are available separately for the <a class="govuk-link" href="">NHS</a>, local authority Directors of Public Health and other organisations such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges">schools and colleges</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Managing <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> (antigen or antibody) <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test results</h2>

<p>The following is general guidance for managing the results of COVID-19 <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> and antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests used as part of a clinical service.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests can be taken by people at home (self-reported tests) or under the supervision of a trained operator who processes the test, reads and reports the result (assisted tests).</p>

<p>A range of factors may affect what an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result means, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the level of training of the person conducting the test</li>
  <li>the presence or absence of possible COVID-19 symptoms</li>
  <li>whether the person tested has had prior laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection</li>
  <li>whether the person is a contact of someone with recent laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection</li>
  <li>whether the person is being tested as part of a COVID-19 outbreak investigation</li>
  <li>whether the person has been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>
<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen test results in those with COVID-19 symptoms</h3>

<p>Anyone with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">main symptoms of COVID-19</a> should begin self-isolation immediately and should request a laboratory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test through NHS Test and Trace and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>. They can take a test by either <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#who-can-be-tested" class="govuk-link">attending a testing centre or by registering and receiving a home sampling kit</a>.</p>

<p>In the event that someone with any of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms" class="govuk-link">main COVID-19 symptoms</a> has a positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result they should follow the advice in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>
<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen test results in those without symptoms</h3>

<p>If an asymptomatic person has a positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result they must begin self-isolation immediately. Advice on self-isolation after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Anyone who receives a negative <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result should follow the advice on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do" class="govuk-link">how to stay safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>. This includes getting tested by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> if they develop COVID-19 symptoms. Anyone who receives a negative <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result as part of daily testing for contacts of confirmed cases should follow the advice in the guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">household</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">non-household</a> contacts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>
<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody test results in those who may have had COVID-19 infection previously</h3>

<p>The use of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> tests to assist in the diagnosis and management of individual patients is not recommended at present, unless as a formal part of one of the programmes or pilot studies within the National Testing Programme.</p>

<p>Should an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> test result, whether positive or negative, be influencing the clinical management of an individual patient, it is essential that a more reliable laboratory <abbr title="enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay">ELISA</abbr> antibody test is performed.</p>

<p>Though evidence is increasing that the presence of antibodies is protective in the short-term, it does not necessarily mean that someone is immune from catching COVID-19 infection again, particularly over longer time periods. <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody tests to detect vaccine induced antibodies have not been evaluated and the tests should not be used for this purpose.</p>
