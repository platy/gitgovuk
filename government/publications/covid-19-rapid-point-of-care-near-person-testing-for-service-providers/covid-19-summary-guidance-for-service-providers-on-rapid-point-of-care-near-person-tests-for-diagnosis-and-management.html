<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>General points on testing</h2>

<p>Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) does not accredit nor does it advise on individual COVID-19 point of care testing devices or platforms, but has contributed to and led Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) commissioned evaluations of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/lateral-flow-devices-results" class="govuk-link">specific devices</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4262">published relevant findings</a>.</p>

<p>There are a variety of terms in common use to describe COVID-19 tests. They are not interchangeable, and care should be taken with terminology. A point of care (<abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>) or near-person (<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr>) test provides a result near to the person being tested, instead of sending their specimen to a laboratory. A <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test may be used within a healthcare setting such as a hospital, a general practice or a pharmacy, or in other settings such as a residential care home, a school, or in a person’s home. Generally, results from <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing are much more rapid (around 30 minutes) than traditional laboratory testing.</p>

<p>The results of COVID-19 tests that detect different parts of the virus or immune response provide different clinical information that often overlaps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nucleic acid tests (for example, polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests) indicate whether an individual has or recently had infectious virus. The majority of those with positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> results are infectious but the virus can persist in some individuals for many weeks and therefore a repeat test is not recommended in someone whose symptoms have resolved</li>
  <li>coronavirus virus protein antigen tests (for example, lateral flow devices (<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr>) for antigens (<abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr>)) indicate whether a person has the virus now and is likely to be infectious to others</li>
  <li>tests for coronavirus antibodies (proteins produced in response to the infection) are conducted on convalescent blood sent to a laboratory or by dropping a fingerprick blood specimen into an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> test for antibodies. They indicate if someone has had the virus before - see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-tests/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-tests">guidance on coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a range of technologies that are used to provide <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing. <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests which detect viral genomic material through amplification are similar in sensitivity to laboratory-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr>) tests, whereas <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests which detect viral protein, such as <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests are less sensitive compared to <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> for detecting any virus. However, <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests are simpler to perform and detect similar proportions of those individuals with high amounts of virus.</p>

<p>The Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-tests-and-testing-kits-for-coronavirus-covid-19-work/for-patients-the-public-and-professional-users-a-guide-to-covid-19-tests-and-testing-kits" class="govuk-link">guide to COVID-19 tests and testing kits</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Types of testing available and recent evaluations</h2>

<p>The standard <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test for current infection is performed on machines by expert laboratory staff in a central laboratory. Other nucleic acid based tests use portable devices to provide rapid <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr> testing outside a laboratory, such as the Simple Amplification Based Assay (<abbr title="Simple Amplification Based Assay">SAMBA II</abbr>), the DNA Nudge platform, and various loop-mediated isothermal amplification (<abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr>) platforms and assays.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen (<abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr>) test uses a colour change on a test strip, without amplification, to directly detect non-nucleic acid antigens of coronavirus. To independently and robustly evaluate the suitability of COVID-19 <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests for comprehensive and repeated testing of whole populations, there is an agreed established <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/protocol-for-evaluation-of-rapid-diagnostic-assays-for-specific-sars-cov-2-antigens-lateral-flow-devices" class="govuk-link">process</a>. By November 2020, four <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests were shown to have a sensitivity of over 70% of all <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> positives and, critically, <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/media_wysiwyg/UK%20evaluation_PHE%20Porton%20Down%20University%20of%20Oxford_final.pdf">these tests detected almost all (over 95%) with high viral loads</a> (the current infections that are most infectious when tested). Sensitivity was not affected by the presence or absence of symptoms in those tested, although test performance was closely related to the level of training of those conducting the test. Five <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests have been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sars-cov-2-lateral-flow-antigen-tests-evaluation-of-vui-20201201/sars-cov-2-lateral-flow-antigen-tests-evaluation-of-vui-20201201">shown to detect</a> the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/new-sars-cov-2-variant">new variant of SARS-CoV-2</a> that became widespread in South-East England and London in December 2020.</p>

<p>Results of field evaluations of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests for testing asymptomatic persons in England are available. Although test sensitivity in a subset of samples in the <a rel="external" href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/coronavirus/Liverpool,Community,Testing,Pilot,Interim,Evaluation.pdf" class="govuk-link">large-scale SMART city-wide testing programme</a> in Liverpool was 40% when compared to <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr>, <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing identified two-thirds of persons with higher <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and around a quarter of the almost 3,800 infectious people were detected solely through <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing. The report highlighted that the sensitivity of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests should be considered alongside the faster time taken to get a test result. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evidence-on-the-accuracy-of-lateral-flow-device-testing/evidence-summary-for-lateral-flow-devices-lfd-in-relation-to-care-homes" class="govuk-link">evaluation</a> of a pilot <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing service for visitors to 20 care homes in low coronavirus prevalence areas as a risk reduction measure highlighted service improvements that should be implemented.</p>

<p>A recent <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm695152a3-H.pdf">field study of university students</a> in the United States who were symptomatic and <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> positive reported <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test sensitivity to be 80%. In students who were asymptomatic and <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> positive, <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> sensitivity was 41%, despite the prevalence overall of SARS-CoV-2 infection being 5%. <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing detected almost 90% of the <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> positives with a high viral load as indicated by having a cycle threshold of 30 or under.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody tests have also been developed. These indicate whether a person has had infection with COVID-19 at some point in the past and cannot diagnose current infection. A phased evaluation process for <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests is being established, similar to that for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assessment-and-procurement-of-coronavirus-covid-19-tests/protocol-for-evaluation-of-rapid-diagnostic-assays-for-specific-sars-cov-2-antigens-lateral-flow-devices" class="govuk-link">antigen tests</a>.</p>

<p>Both <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen and antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests should be distinguished from the postal self-sampling kits that are being sent to homes. These self-sampling kits are used by someone to take their specimen and return it to a central laboratory for testing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Relevant regulations and guidance</h2>

<p>A COVID-19 <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test must have a valid <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ce-marking">CE mark</a> to ensure its design and manufacture achieves the performance specified for its purpose and is safe to use. Following registration with the UK Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-a-non-compliant-medical-device-enforcement-process/how-mhra-ensures-the-safety-and-quality-of-medical-devices"><abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr></a>) or other competent body, the manufacturer places a CE mark on the product thereby declaring that the test meets the required legal criteria. Obtaining a CE mark includes preparation of ‘Instructions for Use’ that specify whether a test should be performed by a trained professional or may be done by a lay person. <abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has provided specific guidance on how to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-declare-as-a-private-sector-covid-19-testing-provider" class="govuk-link">self-declare as a private COVID-19 testing provider</a>.</p>

The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://ukneqasmicro.org.uk/">UK National <abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr> Service</a> for microbiology will have an <abbr title="external quality assessment">EQA</abbr> scheme for <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests in place by end January 2021.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (<abbr title="Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens">ACDP</abbr>) has provisionally classified SARS-CoV-2 as a Hazard Group 3 (<abbr title="Hazard Group 3">HG3</abbr>) pathogen. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-guidance-for-clinical-diagnostic-laboratories/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-handling-and-processing-of-laboratory-specimens#section9" class="govuk-link">Interim guidance</a> has been issued for the safe handling and processing of specimens from patients with possible or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (see Section 3 about risk assessment and <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing).</p>

<p>From December, the <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1549/introduction/made" class="govuk-link">2020 Health Protection (Coronavirus, Testing Requirements and Standards) (England) Regulations</a> require all private coronavirus test providers to be engaged with the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>), and to have achieved <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation for coronavirus testing, no later than June 2021. Also, coronavirus testing is now exempted as a regulated activity under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.</p>

<p>The Health Protection Regulations have been amended to require the reporting of positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 and influenza test results by <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> service providers. <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has issued <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-and-influenza-point-of-care-testing-results-how-to-report">reporting guidance</a> and built a secure <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test reporting web portal to capture these data. A template with a specific format is available from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing support team (<a href="mailto:poct.contact@phe.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">poct.contact@phe.gov.uk</a>) and organisations providing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing services should register to notify results.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span>Managing COVID-19 <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> (antigen or antibody) <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test results</h2>

<p>The following is general guidance for managing the results of coronavirus <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr>, <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen and antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests used on persons with current or recent symptoms as part of a clinical service.</p>

<p>A range of factors may affect what an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result means including: the level of training of the person conducting the test, the presence or not of possible COVID-19 symptoms, whether the person tested has had prior laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether the person is a contact of someone with recent laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether the person has contacts in a setting that is experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, and whether the person has had COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>
<abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> Antigen test results in those with COVID-19 symptoms</h2>

<p>Anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should begin self-isolation immediately (as should other members of their household) and should request a laboratory <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test through NHS Test and Trace. They can take a test by either <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#who-can-be-tested" class="govuk-link">attending a testing centre or by registering and receiving a home sampling kit</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test result is positive, this means they are infected and likely to be infectious. They must complete 10 days isolation; the isolation period includes the day the symptoms started and the next 10 full days (or 14-days if hospitalised). Other household members should complete their 10 day contact isolation period</li>
  <li>coronavirus RNA is usually detected by <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> from two days prior to illness onset to 14 days after. In some individuals <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> testing will detect remnants of viral RNA for much longer and so repeat <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> or other testing is not recommended within 90 days</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test is negative, there is no evidence of virus RNA at the time of testing and the person is highly unlikely to be infected or infectious. False negative <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test results can occur early or late in the illness. If the person is unwell and admitted to hospital with a compatible syndrome and abnormal X-ray findings, further sampling should occur before removing from isolation. A negative test can occur with poor sampling or very early or late in the illness</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event that someone with COVID-19 symptoms has an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result is positive, this means that viral antigens are present, so they are infected and highly likely to be infectious. The likelihood of the test giving a false positive result is low. False positives are an important consideration if testing asymptomatic individuals when the prevalence of disease in the community is low</li>
  <li>in some cases, including for self-reported positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test results, they may be asked to take an <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test. In these situations, they, and other members of their household, should self-isolate immediately they become aware of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> test result. The legal duty to self-isolate and the tracing of non-household contacts are triggered by a positive result from the <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test</li>
  <li>if the <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test is negative, this means that no viral antigens have been detected, and they are highly unlikely to have very high levels of virus at the time the test was done. However, they may have low levels of coronavirus and they, and other members of their household, should continue to self-isolate until a <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test has been undertaken. Further management will depend on the investigatory <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test result. A negative <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test is essential for them to be released from self-isolation</li>
</ul>

<p>Occasionally an individual with COVID-19 like symptoms will begin self-isolation, recover within one to two days and have a negative <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test on the third day or later. Conducting a prompt investigatory <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test is the best way to inform both the likelihood that their recent symptoms were COVID-19 related and how their contacts should be managed.</p>

<p>Invalid <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test results should be repeated with a new test. If a person with COVID-19 symptoms has two invalid <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests, they should have an <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible.</p>

<p>NHS COVID-19 <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> tests are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">free</a> for those with symptoms, those asked to have a test by a local council or by their hospital, or when a test is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-initial-investigation-of-possible-cases/investigation-and-initial-clinical-management-of-possible-cases-of-wuhan-novel-coronavirus-wn-cov-infection" class="govuk-link">considered necessary</a> by a clinical or public health professional.</p>

<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> Antigen test results in those without symptoms</h2>

<p><abbr title="Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has issued an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-issues-exceptional-use-authorisation-for-nhs-test-and-trace-covid-19-self-test-device" class="govuk-link">exceptional use authorisation</a> to the <abbr title="Department for Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to allow use of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing of asymptomatic persons as part of the COVID-19 National Testing Programme. As a risk reduction/mitigation measure, <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> tests are mainly being used in this programme to test large numbers of people without symptoms. By making testing more available and having rapid results, additional asymptomatic infectious people can be detected and isolated immediately. Large groups including staff, residents and patients in health and social care settings, as well as whole city populations, are being tested by different services including the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/asymptomatic-nhs-staff-testing/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-rapid-covid-19-tests-to-be-rolled-out-across-england" class="govuk-link">local authorities</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers-and-third-party-healthcare-providers" class="govuk-link">employers and third-parties</a>.</p>

<p>For those involved in implementing community asymptomatic testing, detailed <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> testing guidance and toolkits, including standard operating procedures and instructional videos for staff, are available separately for the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/asymptomatic-staff-testing-for-covid-19-for-primary-care-staff/">NHS</a>, local authority Directors of Public Health and other organisations such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/947799/schools_and_colleges_testing_handbook.pdf" rel="external">schools and colleges</a>. The toolkits include materials to carry out large-scale testing in various use cases, including schools and colleges, universities and care homes.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> testing of persons without symptoms is currently not recommended unless as a formal part of one of the programmes or pilot studies within the National Testing Programme. When managing the results of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antigen tests used on asymptomatic persons for public health purposes (for example, repeated testing of asymptomatic persons in the community), additional factors apply such as the prevalence of infection in the group tested, and the frequency of testing of members of the group.</p>

<p>If an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result in an asymptomatic person is positive, the person who has been tested may be asked to take an <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test, for instance if disease prevalence is low or where the <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result is self-reported. In these situations, they, and other members of their household, should begin self-isolation immediately they become aware of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> test result. The legal duty to self-isolate and the tracing of non-household contacts will be triggered by a positive result from the follow-up <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test. Where an <abbr title="reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction">RT-PCR</abbr> test is not undertaken, the legal duty to self-isolate and tracing of non-household contacts will begin immediately.</p>

<p>If an asymptomatic individual’s <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result is negative, then the timing of the person’s exposure to coronavirus risk is critical to providing further advice. Given the incubation period for COVID-19 is up to 14 days, a negative test result in someone recently exposed simply means the infection is not manifest yet. If tested as a contact, the person should remain alert for possible COVID-19 symptoms until their contact follow-up period has ended. Anyone who receives a negative <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> <abbr title="antigens">Ag</abbr> test result should continue to observe the [‘Hands, Face, Space’](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-with-others-safely-social-distancing) measures for preventing coronavirus transmission and adhere to any additional guidance that applies to their local area. This includes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/getting-tested-for-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">getting tested if they develop possible COVID-19 symptoms</a>.</p>

<abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody test results in those who may have had COVID-19 infection previously</h2>

<p>Many <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests are now available and there is great variation in their performance. So far, when compared with high-throughput laboratory ELISA antibody tests, which have a <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/898437/Evaluation__of_sensitivity_and_specificity_of_4_commercially_available_SARS-CoV-2_antibody_immunoassays.pdf" class="govuk-link">high level of accuracy, independent evaluations</a> of the most promising <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests have shown each to be less sensitive (<a href="https://d212y8ha88k086.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/17469/181f50b1-8ecf-472f-98c7-aa8c063a592f_15927_-_rosie_mcmahon.pdf?doi=10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15927.1&amp;numberOfBrowsableCollections=8&amp;numberOfBrowsableInstitutionalCollections=0&amp;numberOfBrowsableGateways=14" class="govuk-link" rel="external">study 1</a>, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4262" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study 2</a>).</p>

<p>The use of <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> tests to assist in the diagnosis and management of individual patients is not recommended at present, unless as a formal part of one of the programmes or pilot studies within the National Testing Programme. Should an <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody <abbr title="point of care">POC</abbr>/<abbr title="near-person">NP</abbr> test result, whether positive or negative, be influencing the clinical management of an individual patient’s symptoms, it is essential that a more reliable laboratory ELISA antibody test is performed. Individuals with persistent disease that may be attributable to an earlier COVID-19 infection should be referred to medical care for further investigation.</p>

<p>Though evidence is increasing that the presence of antibodies is protective in the short-term, it does not necessarily mean that someone is immune from catching COVID-19 infection again, particularly over longer time periods. <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody tests to detect vaccine induced antibody has not been evaluated and the tests should not be used for this purpose. Individuals who test positive by <abbr title="lateral flow devices">LFD</abbr> antibody test should be reminded to continue to adhere to all social distancing and public health prevention advice.</p>
