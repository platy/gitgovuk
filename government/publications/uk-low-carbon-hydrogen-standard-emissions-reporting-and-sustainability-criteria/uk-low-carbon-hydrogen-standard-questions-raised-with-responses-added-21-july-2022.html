<h2>General</h2>

<p><strong>1. I have a specific question about the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard that is not covered in the below, where can I ask this?</strong></p>

<p>Please send any questions to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk">hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk</a>, we will review and answer all questions submitted. If applicable to other projects, we may publish a generic answer as an update to this list. Please note the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (“the standard”)  policy and methodology will not change ahead of the next review point.</p>

<p><strong>2. I have emerging evidence that could help inform future iterations of the standard how can I share this with BEIS? When will it be considered, and will I receive feedback?</strong></p>

<p>Please share any emerging evidence you think may help inform future iterations of the standard with the hydrogen production team using <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk">hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk</a>. We will review all evidence submitted and may contact you for further information. If applicable updates may be made to the standard at the agreed review points.</p>

<p><strong>3. Will the standard change / become more stringent over time?</strong></p>

<p>We expect to tighten the standard over time, in line with government’s trajectory to net zero. We will need time to understand how the standard will work in practice as the market develops. We do not have plans to set out the trajectory for the threshold at this stage.</p>

<p><strong>4. When is the next review? If I am already receiving funding and the threshold changes, will the new rules apply to me?</strong></p>

<p>We expect the first review of the standard guidance document to be in early 2023.</p>

<p>Review points for the standard will coincide with future contract awards through the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund and Hydrogen Business Model. Any changes will not be applied retrospectively to contracts that have already been awarded through these schemes.</p>

<p><strong>5. When will the standard be developed into a certification scheme?</strong></p>

<p>As announced in the Energy Security Strategy we aim to launch a hydrogen certification scheme in 2025. Work is ongoing to understand the costs, timeline, and practical implications of introducing such a scheme. We would plan to work with industry on any development.</p>

<h2>Scope and emissions threshold</h2>

<p><strong>6. We are producing hydrogen using a production pathway that is not included in the standard, how can we ensure this pathway is included in future standard iterations?</strong></p>

<p>Production pathways with evidence of compliance with the standard can submit this to BEIS for analysis. All submissions should outline the full methodology used. Please provide as much evidence and background information as possible. The Hydrogen Emissions Calculator may be useful tool for working through the standard methodology. Submit all evidence to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk">hydrogenproduction@beis.gov.uk</a>. BEIS will model the emissions from the pathway proposed. Following thorough scrutiny, new pathway specific guidance may be included in future standard publications.</p>

<p><strong>7. We are using a production pathway not currently listed in the standard, are we eligible to apply for HBM or NZHF funding?</strong></p>

<p>Production pathways not listed in the standard are not eligible for government funding. We have designed the standard review points have with future application windows in mind. We advise any projects seeking government funding to submit evidence of compliance as soon as possible, as per the process above.  Please raise any questions relating to open competitions through the competition specific channels.</p>

<h2>Consignments</h2>

<p><strong>8. Why was the gas day selected as the consignment period for biomass and waste projects?</strong></p>

<p>Under the standard, 1 day is deemed the most appropriate discrete consignment period for most inputs, given data availability and common reporting and sampling frequency. Electricity is the only input where data availability and the significance of more granular carbon intensity data means that shorter consignment periods (30 minutes) are required.</p>

<p><strong>9. When referring to the gas day for discrete consignments made with biomass and waste which day does it relate to, the day of use or the day of arrival at site?</strong></p>

<p>This relates to the day of use. We want to consider the input material that has been used to make the hydrogen product.</p>

<p><strong>10. Will hydrogen producers have flexibility to use different time periods for discrete consignments rather than the time periods set out in the guidance?</strong></p>

<p>The standard does not provide flexibility in consignment size.  The allowable discrete consignment lengths are 30 minutes for low carbon electricity sources and CO2 capture T&amp;S variability, and daily for natural gas, biomass and waste feedstocks. Discrete consignments can be included as part of a monthly averaged consignment.</p>

<p><strong>11. When using biomethane made from multiple sources i.e.: crops, residues and wastes, should the hydrogen made from each input component be separated into discrete consignments?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, biomethane made from different crops, residues and wastes should be broken down into theoretical discrete consignments based on the % of each source in the feedstock, as evidenced by the supplier/sampling.</p>

<p><strong>12. Why are separate discrete hydrogen consignments based on different inputs required if the emissions can be averaged over a month?</strong></p>

<p>It is important that environmental characteristic information is collected for each feedstock, to  ensure that every input complies with the non-GHG criteria set out in the standard. Consignments may then be kept discrete, or averaged, for the purposes of GHG calculations.  This approach was also designed to provide flexibility, allowing as many or as few discrete consignments produced in a calendar month to be included in the monthly averaged consignment.</p>

<h2>Electrolysis</h2>

<p><strong>13. Is on site electricity generation considered as a suitable off grid electricity source under the standard?</strong></p>

<p>Off-grid generation in the standard refers to ‘behind the meter’ arrangements, i.e. on site generation. Both ‘private wire’ and on site generation would be treated in the same way under the standard; provided the technical requirements for electricity input are met, this can be treated as the emissions intensity of the generation asset in real time.</p>

<p>The upstream emissions would need to be calculated and the sustainability criteria of any feedstocks considered. The overall emissions associated with the production of hydrogen including the electricity generation emissions should be taken into account to assess if the hydrogen is compliant with the 20gCO2e/MJ H2 LHV threshold.</p>

<p><strong>14. Is it permissible to use pre rather than post balancing mechanism GHG intensity for grid imported electricity not linked to a specific generation asset, and can we exclude must run gas from grid imported GHG intensity?</strong></p>

<p>We understand the concerns raised about the ability to predict balancing mechanism actions, and therefore the efficiency and cost implications for electrolysers in taking a post-balancing mechanism calculation, however on a principles basis we are keen to ensure system carbon intensity is reflected as accurately as possible in the standard. We intend to provide further detail on this at our next standard review point, which will be reflected in relevant schemes applying the standard for government funding, such as in the Hydrogen Business Model contracts.</p>

<h2>Biomass and waste</h2>

<p><strong>15. Could a mixed fossil and biogenic waste project be compliant with the standard without CCS?</strong></p>

<p>Analysis published alongside our consultation on the standard shows that, without CCS, a mixed waste feedstock would require a high biogenic content for a project’s complete hydrogen output to meet the threshold.</p>

<p>With CCS we expect that most mixed waste feedstocks could meet the standard threshold. Extensive work across government (e.g. the cluster sequencing process), industry and academia is contributing to an effective system for CCS in the UK, into which mixed waste to hydrogen projects can integrate.</p>

<p><strong>16. Do BEIS intend to re-consider the standard’s approach to counterfactuals, with respect to the assignment of upstream emissions to waste streams?</strong></p>

<p>Our decision on the treatment of fossil waste feedstocks will be reviewed as appropriate in light of further evidence, analysis and ongoing work across government on the best accounting methodology to take forward. We will look to the DfT approach to recycled carbon fuels (once finalised), and consider any other useful evidence submitted to us. Any updates to our approach will be made in line with wider review points of the standard.</p>

<p><strong>17. How should upstream emissions for waste streams be accounted for in the standard?</strong></p>

<p>In the guidance document for the standard, we outline that upstream emissions for waste feedstocks only begin at the point of collection. Thereafter, all fossil emissions from the process of conversion to hydrogen are considered in the same way as other fossil emissions in the standard’s methodology.  This means that they are not considered with a counterfactual method, which was outlined as an option in the standard consultation.</p>

<p><strong>18. Under the standard, guarantees of origin or contractual agreements are not accepted as evidence for biomethane, why has this approach been taken when both are required for low carbon electricity sources?</strong></p>

<p>We aim to treat inputs and technologies or low carbon hydrogen production consistently, where possible. However, there are important differences between electricity and biomethane inputs to hydrogen production. These differences are reflected in their treatment under the standard.</p>

<p>There are some practical challenges that make it difficult to prove use of biomethane when delivered by pipeline. There is no existing government-led scheme for guarantees of origin in the UK gas system, as there is for the electricity grid.</p>

<p>We are aware of the mass balancing approach taken under the RTFO and are working with the Department for Transport (DfT) on this topic. This approach is new and complex, requiring significant administrative resource for effective implementation. At this early stage of the standard, we did not see implementing this approach as a proportionate use of resource.</p>

<p>We are open to new evidence in this area, and plan to keep the standard’s treatment of biomethane (and electricity) inputs under review. Any updates to our approach will be made in line with wider review points of the standard.</p>

<p><strong>19. The approach to evidence for biomethane inputs in the standard is different from the approach taken in the RTFO. What impact do you think this will have?</strong></p>

<p>We have worked closely with DfT on biomethane and electricity inputs and will continue to do so. We strive for consistency between policy areas wherever possible.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the objectives and context of the RTFO and the standard differ in important ways. Biomethane supported under the RTFO is used directly as a transport fuel, while the standard is concerned with hydrogen production, for use in a variety of end use sectors. In addition, very little biomethane is currently used in hydrogen production, while biomethane use as a transport fuel is a more established sector.</p>

<p>As such, we don’t expect that the current difference in RTFO and standard approaches for biomethane will have a major negative impact. However, we are open to new evidence on this topic and will keep it under review. Any updates to our approach will be made in line with wider review points of the standard.</p>

<p><strong>20. Can onsite generation of electricity from the combustion of biogenic material, or mixed fossil and biogenic waste, be compliant with the standard?</strong></p>

<p>A project of this kind would be categorised under the standard as electrolytic.</p>

<p>The upstream emissions related to onsite electricity generation from the biogenic or mixed feedstock would have to be calculated and included in the project’s GHG emissions from hydrogen production. Where mixed feedstocks are used, these upstream emissions would have to be calculated separately for each discrete consignment of hydrogen (which would relate to the exact mix of feedstocks). Overall, the emissions relating to each consignment (noting that discrete consignments may then be averaged), alongside all other in-scope emission sources, would need to fall below the standard threshold.</p>

<p>Depending on the exact feedstock, the biogenic portion would also need to comply with the non-GHG criteria in the standard, as laid out in Annexes C &amp; D of the guidance document. Assuming there is sufficient evidence of these criteria being met, and the overall H2 generation process having emissions less than the 20gCO2e/MJ H2 LHV threshold, then this project could be considered compliant with the standard.</p>

<h2>Carbon capture and storage</h2>

<p><strong>21. Why does the standard not consider alternative forms of permanent CO2 sequestration, such as carbon black?</strong></p>

<p>There is currently limited data and no commonly adopted method for the treatment of carbon capture and utilisation. Therefore, CCU is not currently given carbon reduction credits under the standard. We are considering further evidence in this area as it develops and will keep CCU under review. We invite projects with evidence of the permanent nature of CCU processes to submit evidence to support our analysis.</p>
