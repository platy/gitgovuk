<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General Approach to the operation of pharmacovigilance</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> retains responsibility for Pharmacovigilance across the UK.</p>

<p>There are some different requirements for products placed on the market in the UK with respect to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Great Britain is England, Wales and Scotland. For products authorised for sale or supply in Northern Ireland <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> pharmacovigilance requirements will continue to apply in addition to UK requirements as indicated below:</p>

<p>For medicines which are authorised nationally in the UK, you as a Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>), will be required to submit pharmacovigilance data to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, according to UK requirements, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK and non-UK Individual Case Safety Reports (<abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Risk Management Plans (<abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Post-Authorisation Safety Studies (<abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>) protocols and final study reports</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be assessed taking into account all relevant information and decisions will be made reflecting UK clinical practice to best support patient safety in the UK.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000345.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058058f32c#section2">Good Vigilance Practices (<abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>) modules</a> will remain in force but a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptions-and-modifications-to-the-eu-guidance-on-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-that-will-apply-to-uk-mahs-and-the-mhra" class="govuk-link">guidance note on the exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good vigilance practices</a> has been published.</p>

<p>Further guidance on the conversion of Centrally Authorised Products (CAPs) to UK MAs is available on our website. Any conditions or restrictions subject to which the <abbr title="Case Safety Report">CAP</abbr> was granted before 1 January 2021 and have not been fulfilled will apply to the converted MA, as will any post-authorisation obligations prior to that date.</p>

<p>In general, submission of historical data will not be required but we may request this where it is needed for assessment purposes. Where a request is made, the data must be supplied to us within the specified time.</p>

<p>More information on specific areas, including transitional measures, is given below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Actions for submitting and receiving <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We require submission of all UK (including Northern Ireland) <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> (serious and non-serious) and serious <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> from other countries via the new <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Gateway and/or <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Report">ICSR</abbr> Submissions portal which have been developed.</p>

<p>You can register on the MHRA-Gateway and/or ICSR Submissions portal to enable configuration to your systems.</p>

<p>If you have already registered, you do not need to complete this process again.</p>

<p>For products placed on the market in Northern Ireland you should continue to submit <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> according to <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements to the Eudravigilance database including all serious reports from the UK and other countries and non-serious reports that occur in the EEA or in Northern Ireland. These cases should be identified by using the country code âXIâ in the field primary source country for regulatory purposes. Organisations have the option to use either the country code âXIâ or âGBâ as the first two characters of the worldwide case ID and the safety report ID.</p>

<p>For UK cases that relate to Northern Ireland which were initially submitted before 1 January 2021, the worldwide case ID should not be changed, however, in line with <abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> module VI guidance when sending follow-up reports organisations can change the safety report case ID if needed.</p>

<p>The country code âGBâ should be used for all reportable SUSARs occurring in the UK. Although it is possible for organisations to use the country code âXIâ for SUSAR reporting, it will not be a requirement as reporting requirements between Northern Ireland and the rest of UK for clinical trial cases will not differ.</p>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/950178/MHRA_ICSR_Reconciliation_Sheet.xlsx">A list of reports received via the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> from 28 December to 31 December</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Signal detection</h2>

<p>In line with current requirements, your signal detection systems will need to enable you to meet your requirements for cumulative signal detection across all available data sources. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will not require you to conduct signal detection against our own database, as we will make relevant UK data available for inclusion in your systems.</p>

<p>You are reminded that you are obliged to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of signals arising from any data source. This also includes standalone signal notifications submitted by you to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> that are relevant to your products as well as signals raised by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>We request that <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> signal assessment reports are shared with us once the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> recommendation is available. Signal assessment reports should be submitted to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:safetyprojects@mhra.gov.uk">safetyprojects@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>A new or changed risk that requires a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation should in principle be the subject of an application for variation of the terms of marketing authorisation, unless the marketing authorisation holder considers that further analysis by the licensing authority is warranted. Further analysis by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may be sought on signals in the case of validated signals that cannot be refuted nor confirmed as new or changed risks by the marketing authorisation holder based on their assessment. If a <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is due to be submitted within 6-months of the completion of the MA holderâs assessment of the signal, the signal should be reported in the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> and a separate standalone  signal notification is not required unless advised otherwise by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.  However, if the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> includes a signal that corresponds to an important risk (see <abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> Annex 1), you should notify us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk">signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk</a> at the time of submission of the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>. Refuted signals need only be reported in <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>.</p>

<p>The same principles apply where the <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> has been requested to assess a signal by another regulatory authority. Further analysis by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may be sought using the standalone signal notification form, otherwise, a variation should be submittedor the signal reported in the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> asdetailed above . In these circumstances, if the  signal is included within the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>, you should additionally notify us at the time of <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submission.</p>

<p>For products placed on the Northern Ireland market, you are additionally required to report to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> those safety signals that are considered to meet the definition of an emerging safety issue (<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-gvp-module-ix-signal-management-rev-1_en.pdf">see <abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>-Module IX Signal Management</a> ).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will carry out assessment of signals and issue decisions for signals identified by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as well as those highlighted internationally.</p>

<p>You are obliged to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of emerging safety issues within 3 working days after establishing that a signal or a safety issue from any source meets the definition of an emerging safety issue.</p>

<p>You can notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk">signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Risk Management Plans (<abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> continues to accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> versions of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>, but where we have made a specific request for information to be included this may need to be provided in a UK-specific annex using <a rel="external" href="https://mhra-gov.filecamp.com/s/GlW6PJnx3TMFDr55/d" class="govuk-link">this format</a>.</p>

<p>The current approved version of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> should be included in the initiating sequence as part of the conversion process for <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-in-a-no-deal-scenario-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-ch">Conversion of Centrally Authorised Products (<abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr>) to UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> and updates to <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> for products authorised to be sold or supplied in the UK should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, via the appropriate variation procedure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> submitted after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> versions of the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>, but where the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has made a specific request for information or where there is UK-specific information relevant to the benefit/ risk assessment this should be included in a specific annex. We may develop our own submission requirements and develop a list of UK reference dates for products authorised in Great Britain only, but until this happens the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> reference date (<abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr>) list should be followed for .<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submissions to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> should therefore be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> at the same time as to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>The content and format for all <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> will remain the same as currently required in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and the expectation is that where a <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is required to be submitted to both the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, the same <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> will be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. In general, you will not be required to re-submit to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> that have been submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository,prior to 1 January 2021 but we may need to request a copy in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Unless the marketing authorisation specifies differently, <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives/combinations not currently on the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> list and therefore not subject to the single assessment process should be submitted  at least six monthly during the first 2 years following placing on the market, once a year for the following 2 years and every 3 years after that.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> assessment results in an amendment to the product information, we request that you notify us of the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> recommendation as soon as possible and submit a copy of the CMDh Decision or CHMP opinion as soon as available. This information should be submitted by e-mail to <a href="mailto:safetyprojects@mhra.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">safetyprojects@mhra.gov.uk</a>. This will allow us to take the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> recommendation into account in our assessment of anyproduct information updates to avoid any unnecessary divergence. Provided that this information is submitted to us in a timely manner we will inform <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations Holders">MAHs</abbr> if, following our assessment, we have any additional requirements to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. This will be communicated before or shortly after (within 14 days) the publication of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> outcome but otherwise the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> outcome should be implemented. A delay in the providing the necessary information the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may result in additional requests being made outside this timeframe.</p>

<p>We have developed our own submission portal for <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>. More detailed requirements for submission can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-to-make-submissions-to-the-mhra" class="govuk-link">here</a> but <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> can be submitted to the portal in PDF or Word format or as part of a zip file format.  Submissions will not be required as part of the <abbr title="electronic Common Technical Document">eCTD</abbr> lifecycle in the UK and should not be submitted as part of the initiating sequence in the conversion process for centrally authorised to Great Britain -only <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>. Please note that <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> cannot be submitted via the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submission portal and must be submitted via a separate variation submission.</p>

<p>A fee of Â£890 will be payable for the assessment of <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives/ combinations currently listed on the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> (or future UK reference date list) which are submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. There will be a reduction to Â£445 for each <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> where more than one <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is involved in the procedure and submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. .No further fee will be payable for the amendment of the product information as a result of the UK assessment which should be made by a Type IA variation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for products authorised in the UK should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> via the submission portal.Where the product is authorised  in Northern Ireland, you should also submit your <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>  to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository.</p>

<p>As stated above, in the future we may amend reporting requirements for <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for products authorised by Great Britain-only <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>. However, for the time being you should continue to submit according to the timelines set out in the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> list.</p>

<p><abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives authorised via an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> MA (centralised authorisation) which will apply directly in Northern Ireland need only be submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository.</p>

<p>You should continue to submit information regarding the informal PSUSA follow-up procedure to us via the usual procedure (i.e. via CESP not the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> submission portal). Outcomes should be implemented via the same type of variation procedure as in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> and where the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> have additional requirements we will inform you.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> submitted before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is for a product authorised by a UK MA, with respect to both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the procedure will continue in line with the single-assessment procedure.</p>

<p>Where the assessment was concluded but the outcome not implemented before 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will take the necessary steps to implement the outcome. Where this involves a variation to the MA, the application should be submitted taking into account the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-changes">guidance on converting <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> to UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr></a> where this applies (also see section 10).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols and results submitted after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p><strong><abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> Protocols</strong></p>

<p>For non-interventional <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> where the study is a condition of the UK MA, the draft protocol should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> prior to the start of the study.  Where the MA applies in Northern Ireland, the draft study protocol should also be submitted to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (<abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>); with the exception of a study that is only to be conducted in the UK at the request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> in which case the protocol should only be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.  For studies that are a condition of a GB MA or a UK MA, where the study is to be conducted in the UK at the request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will assess the protocol and contact you within 60 days.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> is a condition of the MA, any significant amendments to the draft protocol should also be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and where the MA applies in Northern Ireland additionally to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> unless the study is only being conducted in the UK at the request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. The definition of significant amendment is in line with that provided  in Good Vigilance Practice Module VIII.</p>

<p>There is no specific requirement to submit draft protocols for <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> which are not a condition of the MA but are a requirement of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> (category 3). However, we may request submission where we consider that an assessment is required, in this case the protocol should be submitted as Type II (standard) variation.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> Results</strong></p>

<p>Final study reports for non-interventional <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> (either voluntary or a condition of the MA). that involve collection of safety data from patients/healthcare professionals should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>The final study report should be submitted within 12-months of the end of data collection.</p>

<p>Interim reports for <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> which are a condition of the UK MA should also be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.Interim reports for <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> which are a condition of the MA and all final study report for non-interventional <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>, where the MA applies in Northern Ireland the study report should also be submitted to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (<abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>) (unless the study was only conducted in the UK and not at the request of <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>)</p>

<p>Interim reports for category 3 studies are generally not required, but where we require interim reports for these <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>, we will inform you.</p>

<h4>6.1.2 Submission and fees</h4>

<p><strong>Imposed <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> that are conditions of the MA(category 1 and 2 studies)</strong></p>

<p>Protocol and Final Study reports</p>

<p>Protocol and final study reports which are submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> as Article 107 procedures should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as standalone <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> submissions using a variation procedure as detailed below:</p>

<p>Where protocols and final study reports are also submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will refer to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision and the relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation (assessment report, CHMP opinion etc.) should be included in the submission. The protocol and final study report should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> using a Type II (standard) variation procedure (classification C.I.13) with the corresponding fee of Â£734.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> is to be conducted only in the UK, or relates to a product authorised only in Great Britain and the protocol and final study report have not been submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>, the protocol and final study reports should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> via a Type II (complex) variation procedure (classification C.I.13) with the corresponding fee of Â£8,309.</p>

<p>Significant amendments and interim study reports</p>

<p>Significant amendments to study protocols and interim study reports for category 1 and 2 <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as post authorisation measures/ commitments via the information update route and will not incur a fee (please section 9). It should be clearly stated in the cover letter that the amendment or interim report relates to a category 1 or 2 <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>.</p>

<p><strong>Non-imposed <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> (category 3 studies)</strong></p>

<p>Where draft protocols are requested, they should be submitted via the Type II (standard) variation route
Final study reports for category 3 studies should be submitted as a Type II (standard) variation.</p>

<p>Where protocols and final study reports are also submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will refer to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision and the relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation (assessment report, CHMP opinion etc.) should be included in the submission</p>

<p>Where interim reports are required these should be submitted to us as post authorisation measures/ commitments via the information update route and will not incur a fee (please see section 9)</p>

<h4>6.1.3 Updates to product information to reflect study results</h4>

<p>Where the results of any <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> study affect the product information, the amendments should be submitted via a separate type II variation. The reliance procedure can be used where you wish to make the same amendments to the product information as those agreed for the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> MA (see section 10).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Ongoing issues regarding <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) either endorsed a draft study protocol or made a substantial amendment to a draft protocol before 1 January 2021, we will accept the draft or the amended draft study protocol but may request that further information is submitted to us within a specified time.</p>

<p>Where a non-interventional <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> was proposed or imposed but the draft protocol was not endorsed prior to 1 January 2021, the assessment will be concluded by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> but any information required by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>, together with any information required by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> regarding the protocol, should be submitted directly to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This must happen even if the information was submitted via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure prior to 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Ongoing issues with <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> final study reports after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Where a final study report was submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> before 1 January 2021 but no recommendation was made before that date, we will accept the conclusion made by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> but may request that the study report and abstract of the study report are submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> together with any further information relating to the study. In any event you should evaluate the impact of the results on the authorisation and submit a variation application as necessary.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> made a recommendation prior to 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will implement the agreed measures in line with the agreed timetable. You should submit any variation to us (for converted <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> please refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-changes" class="govuk-link">the guidance on our website</a> and we will determine the application within the usual timeframes).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Safety Referrals</h2>

<p>For procedures started but not concluded before 1 January 2021, the procedure will follow the usual process, but all information should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. We will then implement the outcome of the procedure.</p>

<p>Where the referral was concluded but the decision not implemented before 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will take the necessary steps to implement the final decision (see section 10).</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021 UK products will continue be part of Union referral procedures in respect of Northern Ireland. The scientific opinion and Commission Decisions or CMDh Decisions will include UK products in respect of Northern Ireland. You should implement the outcome  via the relevant variation procedure where your MA covers Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Where you hold a Great Britain-only MA and the outcome of an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> referral is to be reflected in your MA you should submit a Type II variation application together with all relevant  documentation  regarding the referral. This will be assessed by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, taking into account the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision, to determine the necessary updates to the product information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Major Safety Reviews</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021, where there are concerns regarding a medicine or class of medicines that are authorised in the UK, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may conduct a major safety review to review the available data and consider what regulatory action may be needed.</p>

<p>In these circumstances we will publicly announce the initiation of the review, outlining the reasons for the review, the list of affected active substances and products, and the timescales for the review.</p>

<p>Where you hold a MA for an affected product, you will be notified of the start of and reasons for the review. You will also be provided with a list of questions that should be addressed by all <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations Holders">MAHs</abbr> along with the deadline by which the requested information should be submitted.</p>

<p>In the first instance, this correspondence will be done via the Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) but a different or additional contact for future correspondence can be nominated. The outcome of the review will be published. Where the recommendations include proposals for regulatory action the details of the measures to be taken including any changes to the product information will be published.</p>

<p>A major safety review will incur the following fees for assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£51,286 where one or two active ingredients or combinations of active ingredients are included</li>
  <li>Â£59,595, where three active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
  <li>Â£67,904, where four active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
  <li>Â£76,213, where five or more active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the review relates to 2 or more authorisations, the fee will be divided by the number of authorisations forming part of the review and you will pay that reduced fee for each relevant authorisation you hold.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Post-authorisation Measures (<abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>Post-authorisation measures and commitments  including specific obligations, Annex II conditions, additional pharmacovigilance activities in the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> (MEA), legally binding measures (LEG) or recommendations in place on 1 January 2021 will remain in place for converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> until considered fulfilled. For <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> granted via the reliance route after 1 January 2021 all post- authorisation measures and commitments agreed for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> MA will also apply. Standalone <abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr> should be submitted  as a post-authorisation commitment via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> portal using the information update route. The nature of the PAM should be clearly stated in the cover letter. We will take into account the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision on any PAM, providing the relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation (CHMP opinion, AR assessment report etc.) is submitted, once available, via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> portal. In most circumstances the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will not issue a separate approval for <abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr> unless we have additional requirements, or the PAM is at the request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where data relating to a PAM was submitted before 1 January 2021, a copy of the application should be included in the data submission package for converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>Where your evaluation of data supporting a MEA or LEG recommends that an update to the product information is required this should be submitted via a Type II variation application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Implementation of outcomes of <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> referrals and procedures concerning <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>, <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>, signal assessments and <abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> should continue to monitor the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> website and implement the outcomes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decisions as appropriate. Where you hold a UK MA which covers Northern Ireland, the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> outcome must be implemented and the same type of variation procedure as recommended in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure should be used to implement the change for the UK MA.</p>

<p>For Great Britain-only <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>, the expectation is that you  will follow <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> outcomes and make the same changes to the Great Britain-only MA that are made to the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> MA. In order to do so you will need to submit the corresponding procedure to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.Where the outcome for the corresponding centrally-authorised product is implemented as part of the EC Decision without a separate variation . , a Type IAIN variation should be submitted to implement the same outcome for the Great Britain-only MA, unless you are advised otherwise. Where we have UK specific requirements for submission of procedures these are detailed in the relevant sections of this guidance.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated in this guidance (please see specific advice regarding <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> and referrals) the reliance route can be used to implement the outcome for the corresponding <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure for Great Britain- only MA. In this case you must provide all relevant <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation (CHMP opinion, assessment report and, where applicable, the EC decision). However, the reliance route is not a substitute for <abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr> obligations to submit pharmacovigilance data and information to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and to keep the MA up to date with current scientific knowledge. Information regarding safety, including that in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> documentation, may be required earlier than the CHMP opinion stage. In particular, where there is information which affects the benefit: risk balance of the product or potentially impacts the clinical management of patients, including where proactive communications to healthcare professionals may be required, we would expect to receive the information as soon as available and submission should not be delayed until the CHMP opinion is available. There may be other circumstances where the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may request that you provide information regarding the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> assessment prior to the CHMP opinion.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> assessment results in additional UK-specific requirements we will contact <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations Holders">MAHs</abbr> directly before or shortly after (within 14 days) the publication of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> outcome. However, where necessary data, as outlined above, has not been provided this may lead to a delay in us contacting you regarding UK specific requests.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Requirements for <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> granted via the Unfettered Access route</h2>
<p>Where you have a Great Britain-only MA granted via the unfettered access route, all pharmacovigilance obligations continue to apply. To ensure the safety of patients in Great Britain you must provide any new information that may impact on the terms of the MA and/ or impact on the balance of benefits and risk of the product. This includes information from clinical trials and data on the use of the product outside the terms of the MA. Unless otherwise stated, the same data/submission as that provided to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. Other requirements are set out below</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Submitting ICSRS</h3>
<p>You should submit to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> reports of all serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the UK and other countries, and all non-serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the UK via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Gateway and/or <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Report">ICSR</abbr> submissions portal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Provision of other Pharmacovigilance data</h3>
<p>You should submit copies of the Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> portal. We will accept copies of the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in line with the frequency set by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>All other pharmacovigilance data submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, including <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>, <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols and final study reports etc. should also be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, and we will accept copies of the same information submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>
