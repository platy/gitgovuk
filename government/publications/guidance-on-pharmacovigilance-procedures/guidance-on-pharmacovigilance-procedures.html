<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General Approach to the operation of pharmacovigilance</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> retains responsibility for Pharmacovigilance across the UK.</p>

<p>There are some different requirements for products placed on the market in the UK with respect to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Great Britain is England, Wales and Scotland. For products authorised for sale or supply in Northern Ireland <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> pharmacovigilance requirements will continue to apply in addition to UK requirements as indicated below:</p>

<p>For medicines which are authorised nationally in the UK, you as a Marketing Authorisation Holder (<abbr title="Marketing Authorisation Holder">MAH</abbr>), will be required to submit pharmacovigilance data to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, according to UK requirements, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UK and non-UK Individual Case Safety Reports (<abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Risk Management Plans (<abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Post-Authorisation Safety Studies (<abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>) protocols and final study reports</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be assessed taking into account all relevant information and decisions will be made reflecting UK clinical practice to best support patient safety in the UK.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/regulation/document_listing/document_listing_000345.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058058f32c#section2" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Good Vigilance Practices (<abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>) modules</a> will remain in force but a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exceptions-and-modifications-to-the-eu-guidance-on-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-that-will-apply-to-uk-mahs-and-the-mhra" class="govuk-link">guidance note on the exceptions and modifications to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> guidance on good vigilance practices</a> has been published.</p>

<p>Further guidance on the conversion of Centrally Authorised Products (CAPs) to UK MAs is available on our website. Any conditions or restrictions subject to which the <abbr title="Case Safety Report">CAP</abbr> was granted immediately before 1 January 2021 will apply to the converted MA, as will any post-authorisation obligations prior to that date.</p>

<p>In general, submission of historical data will not be required but we may request this where it is needed for assessment purposes. Where a request is made, the data must be supplied to us within the specified time period.</p>

<p>More information on specific areas, including transitional measures, is given below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Actions for submitting and receiving <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>We will require submission of all UK (including Northern Ireland) <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> (serious and non-serious) and serious <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> from other countries via the new <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Gateway or/<abbr title="Individual Case Safety Report">ICSR</abbr> Submissions portal which have been developed.</p>

<p>You can register on the MHRA-Gateway and/or ICSR Submissions portal to enable configuration to your systems. Registrations should be made as early as possible.</p>

<p>If you have already registered you do not need to complete this process again.</p>

<p>For products placed on the market in Northern Ireland you will need to continue to submit <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Reports">ICSRs</abbr> according to  <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements to the Eudravigilance database including all serious reports from the UK and other countries and non-serious reports that occur in the EEA or in Northern Ireland. This will require a technical change and we expect the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> to provide information on this in due course. These cases should be identified by using the country code âXIâ in the field primary source country for regulatory purposes. Organisations have the option to use the either the country code âXIâ or âGBâ as the first two characters of the worldwide case ID and the safety report ID.</p>

<p>For UK cases that relate to Northern Ireland which were initially submitted before 1 January 2021, the worldwide case ID should not be changed, however, in line with <abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr> module VI guidance when sending follow-up reports the organisations can change the safety report case ID if needed.</p>

<p>The country code âGBâ should be used for all reportable SUSARs occurring in the UK. Although it is possible for organisations to use the country code âXIâ for SUSAR reporting, it will not be a requirement as reporting requirements between Northern Ireland and the rest of UK for clinical trial cases will not differ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Signal detection</h2>

<p>In line with current requirements, your signal detection systems will need to enable you to meet your requirements for cumulative signal detection across all available data sources. The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will not require you to conduct signal detection against our own database, as we will make relevant UK data available for inclusion in your systems.</p>

<p>You are reminded that you are obliged to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of signals arising from any data source. This also includes standalone signal notifications submitted by you to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> that are relevant to your products as well as signals raised by the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr>.</p>

<p>For products placed on the Northern Ireland market, you are additionally required to report to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> those safety signals that are considered to meet the definition of an emerging safety issue (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-good-pharmacovigilance-practices-gvp-module-ix-signal-management-rev-1_en.pdf" rel="external">see <abbr title="Good Vigilance Practice">GVP</abbr>-Module IX Signal Management</a> ).</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will carry out assessment of signals and issue decisions for signals identified by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as well as those highlighted internationally.</p>

<p>You are obliged to notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> of emerging safety issues within 3 working days after establishing that a signal or a safety issue from any source meets the definition of an emerging safety issue.</p>

<p>You can notify the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk">signalmanagement@mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Risk Management Plans (<abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> versions of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr>, but where we have made a specific request for information to be included this may need to be provided in a specific annex. For <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> the current approved version of the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> should be included in the initiating sequence as part of the conversion process.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-in-a-no-deal-scenario-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-ch">Conversion of Centrally Authorised Products (<abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr>) to UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr></a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> and updates to <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr> for products authorised to be sold or supplied in the UK should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, via the appropriate variation procedure.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> submitted after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will continue to accept <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> versions of the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr>, but where the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> has made a specific request for information or where there is UK-specific information relevant to the benefit/ risk assessment this should be included in a specific annex. We may develop our own submission requirements and develop a list of UK reference dates, but until this happens the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> reference date (<abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr>) list should be followed and <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>, with submission dates after 1 January 2021, should be submitted to the UK at the same time as submission to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>, for products which are the subject of a UK MA, with the same active/combination, should be submitted as part of the same procedure. The content and format will remain the same as currently required in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, and the expectation is that the same <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> will be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> as to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>. In general, you will not be required to re-submit <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository prior to 1 January 2021, but we may request a copy in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Unless the marketing authorisation specifies differently, <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives/combinations not currently on the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> list and therefore not subject to the single assessment process should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, at least six monthly during the first 2 years following placing on the market, once a year for the following 2 years and every 3 years after that.</p>

<p>We will issue the outcomes of our assessments shortly after publication of the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> assessment, at the latest, in order to maintain harmonisation with the submission requirements on the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> list, where appropriate.</p>

<p>We have developed our own submission portal for <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>. More detailed requirements for submission will be issued but <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> can be submitted to the portal in PDF or Word or as part of a zip file format. <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submissions will not be required as part of the CTD lifecycle in the UK and should not be submitted as part of the initiating sequence in the conversion process for centrally authorised to UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>A fee of Â£890 will be payable for the assessment of <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives/ combinations currently listed on the <abbr title="EU reference date">EURD</abbr> (or future UK reference date list) which are submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. There will be a reduction to Â£445 for each <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> where more than one <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is involved in the procedure. Following assessment, we will publish the outcome of <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> assessment procedures including any amendments to the SPC and PL wording. No further fee will be payable for the amendment of the product information as a result of the UK assessment which should be made by a Type IA variation.</p>

<p>For products authorised in the UK your <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> system.</p>

<p>Where the product is authorised for sale and supply in Northern Ireland, you should additionally submit your <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> in line with <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> requirements to the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository. The outcomes from the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure should be implemented.</p>

<p><abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> for actives authorised via a <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> MA (centralised authorisation) which will apply directly in Northern Ireland need only be submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> repository.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr> submitted before 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Where the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> is for a product authorised by a UK MA, in respect to both Great Britain and Northern Ireland the procedure will continue in line with the single-assessment procedure.</p>

<p>Where the assessment was concluded but the outcome not implemented before 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will take the necessary steps to implement the outcome. Where this involves a variation to the MA, the application should be submitted taking into account the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-changes">guidance on converting <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> to UK <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr></a> where this applies (also see section 10).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Post Authorisation Safety Studies (<abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols and results submitted after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> where the study is a condition of the UK MA, prior to the start of the study the draft protocol should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> and will be assessed in line with usual practices. Where the MA applies in Northern Ireland the draft study protocol should also be submitted to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (unless the study is only to be conducted in the UK at the request of the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>).</p>

<p>For all PASSs that are non-interventional, that are either voluntary or a condition of the MA and that involve collection of safety data from patients/healthcare professionals you should send the final study reports to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> for assessment</p>

<p>You should submit the final study report (and abstract of study results) to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. Where the MA applies in Northern Ireland the study report should also be submitted to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (unless the study was only conducted in the UK).</p>

<p>The final study report should be submitted within 12 months of the end of data collection. The fee for assessment of <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols or final study reports is Â£8,309. This is the case where the study is to be conducted only in the UK or is subject to a Great Britain-only MA. In all other cases the fee is Â£734.</p>

<p>The reduced fee also applies where the MA has been granted via the unfettered access route and the same protocol/final study report has been submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> or Northern Ireland MA. Both protocols and final study reports should be submitted to us using either the Type II complex variation route (classification C.I.13) where the higher fee is applicable or via the Type II route in all other cases with the corresponding fee.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) either endorsed a draft study protocol or made a substantial amendment to a draft protocol before 1 January 2021, we will accept the draft or the amended draft study protocol but may request that further information is submitted to us within a specified time.</p>

<p>Where a non-interventional <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> was proposed or imposed but the draft protocol was not endorsed prior to 1 January 2021, the assessment will be concluded by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> but any information required by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr>, together with any information required by the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> regarding the protocol, should be submitted directly to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>.</p>

<p>This must happen even if the information was submitted via the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> procedure prior to 1 January 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Ongoing issues with <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> final study reports after 1 January 2021</h3>

<p>Where a final study report was submitted to the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> before 1 January 2021 but no recommendation was made before that date, we will accept the conclusion made by the <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> but may request that the study report and abstract of the study report are submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> together with any further information relating to the study. In any event you should evaluate the impact of the results on the authorisation and submit a variation application as necessary.</p>

<p>Where <abbr title="Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee">PRAC</abbr> made a recommendation prior to 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will implement the agreed measures in line with the agreed timetable. You should submit any variation to us (for converted <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> please refer to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/converting-centrally-authorised-products-caps-to-uk-marketing-authorisations-mas-grandfathering-and-managing-lifecycle-changes" class="govuk-link">the guidance on our website</a> and we will determine the application within the usual timeframes).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Safety Referrals</h2>

<p>For procedures started but not concluded before 1 January 2021, the procedure will follow the usual process but all information should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. We will then implement the outcome of the procedure.</p>

<p>Where the referral was concluded but the decision not implemented before 1 January 2021, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> will take the necessary steps to implement the final decision (see section 10).</p>

<p>From 1 January 2021 UK products will continue be part of Union referral procedures in respect of Northern Ireland. The scientific opinion and Commission Decisions will include UK products in respect of Northern Ireland. You should implement the outcome where your MA covers Northern Ireland.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Major Safety Reviews</h2>

<p>From 1 January 2021, where there are concerns regarding a medicine or class of medicines that are authorised in the UK, the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> may conduct a major safety review to review the available data and consider what regulatory action may be needed.</p>

<p>In these circumstances we will publicly announce the initiation of the review, outlining the reasons for the review, the list of affected active substances and products, and the timescales for the review.</p>

<p>Where you hold a MA for an affected product, you will be notified of the start of and reasons for the review. You will also be provided with a list of questions that should be addressed by all <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations Holders">MAHs</abbr> along with the deadline by which the requested information should be submitted.</p>

<p>In the first instance, this correspondence will be done via the Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance (QPPV) but a different or additional contact for future correspondence can be nominated. The outcome of the review will be published. Where the recommendations include proposals for regulatory action the details of the measures to be taken including any changes to the product information will be published.</p>

<p>A major safety review will incur the following fees for assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£51,286 where one or two active ingredients or combinations of active ingredients are included</li>
  <li>Â£59,595, where three active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
  <li>Â£67,904, where four active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
  <li>Â£76,213, where five or more active ingredients, or combinations of active ingredients, are included</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the review relates to 2 or more authorisations, the fee will be divided by the number of authorisations forming part of the review and you will pay that reduced fee for each relevant authorisation it holds.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Post-authorisation Measures (<abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr>)</h2>
<p>Post-authorisation obligations - including specific obligations, Annex II conditions, additional pharmacovigilance activities in the <abbr title="Risk Management Plan">RMP</abbr> (MEA), legally binding measures (LEG) or recommendations - in place on 1 January 2021 will remain in place. For converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> we recommend that you use the current application forms for <abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr> and submit the information to us as a post-authorisation commitment, following the same principles for submission as for variations in the <abbr title="Case Safety Reports">CAPs</abbr> conversion guidance.</p>

<p>Where data relating to a PAM was submitted before 1 January 2021 but the assessment was not concluded we will conclude the assessment where appropriate. For converted <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> a copy of the application should be included in the data submission package.</p>

<p>Where your evaluation of data supporting a MEA or LEG suggests that an update to the product information is required this should be submitted via a Type II variation application.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span> Implementation of outcomes of referrals and procedures concerning <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>, <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr>, signal assessments and <abbr title="Post-authorisation Measures">PAMs</abbr>
</h2>

<p>Where an amendment to the product information is required as a result of the above procedures, this will be implemented via a variation procedure. Where the procedure was concluded before 1 January 2021, but the variation was not submitted, the outcome will be implemented by the same procedure as for the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (Type IA, Type IB or Type II).</p>

<p>Where the variation was submitted but not finally processed before 1 January 2021, the variation will be concluded in line with the outcome of the procedure.</p>

<p>Where there was no <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision before 1 January 2021, we will conclude the procedure and the outcome will be published together with advice on implementation.</p>

<p>If you hold an MA which applies in Northern Ireland you should continue to monitor the <abbr title="European Medicines Agency">EMA</abbr> website and implement the outcomes from <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decisions as appropriate. Where the UK has additional requirements, we will publish this on our own website shortly after the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision is published and give advice on how safety updates should be implemented with the aim of not creating a conflict with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> decision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Requirements for <abbr title="Marketing Authorisations">MAs</abbr> granted via the Unfettered Access route</h2>
<p>Where you have a Great Britain-only MA granted via the unfettered access route, all pharmacovigilance obligations continue to apply. In order to ensure the safety of patients in Great Britain you must provide any new information that may impact on the terms of the MA and/ or impact on the balance of benefits and risk of the product. This includes information from clinical trials and data on the use of the product outside the terms of the MA. Unless otherwise stated, the same data/submission as that provided to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> should be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>. Other requirements are set out below</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Submitting ICSRS</h3>
<p>You should submit to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> reports of all serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the UK and other countries, and all non-serious suspected adverse reactions that occur in the UK via the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> Gateway and/or <abbr title="Individual Case Safety Report">ICSR</abbr> submissions portal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Provision of other Pharmacovigilance data</h3>
<p>You should submit copies of the Periodic Safety Update Reports (<abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Reports">PSURs</abbr>) to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> portal. We will accept copies of the <abbr title="Periodic Safety Update Report">PSUR</abbr> submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> in line with the frequency set by the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>

<p>All other pharmacovigilance data submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, including <abbr title="Risk Management Plans">RMPs</abbr>, <abbr title="Post-Authorisation Safety Studies">PASS</abbr> protocols and final study reports etc should also be submitted to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>, and we will accept copies of the same information submitted to the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>
