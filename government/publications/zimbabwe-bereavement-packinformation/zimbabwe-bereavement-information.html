<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>

<h2>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the nearest British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">here</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>In Zimbabwe the next of kin is normally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>surviving spouse or partner</li>
  <li>parent</li>
  <li>adult child (over 18 years)</li>
  <li>adult sibling (over 18 years)</li>
  <li>nearest surviving relative</li>
  <li>formally appointed representative</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may be only available to next of kin. Consular officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>In Zimbabwe, information concerning a death might be restricted. It may be difficult to obtain more than a post mortem and a police report. If a death is under investigation no information will be released until the investigation has been concluded. Local authorities do have the ability to make calls to next of kin in the UK to keep them updated with any developments but may ask the Embassy to do this on their behalf.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Zimbabwe, you can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/zimbabwe-list-of-funeral-directors/zimbabwe-list-of-funeral-directors">list of funeral directors in Zimbabwe here</a>.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe has a number of local and international funeral directors and most are able to assist with arranging a local burial or cremation, or repatriating the deceased or the ashes to the UK. If the person who died did not have insurance you or the formally appointed representative must appoint a funeral director of your choice and will be responsible for the cost of the funeral director.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. Sometimes a funeral director can do this for you. You will usually need documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as full name, date of birth and passport number.</p>

<p>The local authorities will need to be told if the person suffered from an infectious condition such as hepatitis, HIV or COVID-19 so they can take precautions against infection.</p>

<p>You do not need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. If it is not in English, you will need to obtain and pay for an official translation.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a death certificate in Zimbabwe, the death must be registered with the Registrar Generals Office. You can do this yourself, or a funeral director can do it on your behalf.</p>

<p>To register a death the following documents must be submitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a photographic identity document or valid passport of you or the formally appointed representative</li>
  <li>the deceased’s photographic identity document or valid passport and if the deceased is a minor their birth certificate</li>
  <li>a medical certificate confirming cause of death (BD12 form), if the deceased died in a private medical institution it shall be completed by a medical doctor</li>
  <li>notice of death form (BD11 form) completed by Police Officer if the deceased died at home</li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain a Certificate of Death the following documents must be submitted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a burial order or cremation certificate</li>
  <li>the deceased’s marriage certificate or divorce document</li>
  <li>the deceased’s photographic identity document or valid passport</li>
  <li>a photographic identity document or valid passport of you or the formally appointed representative</li>
</ul>

<p>The Certificate of Death is in English and is broken down into 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details of the deceased including cause of death</li>
  <li>person who gave notice of the death</li>
  <li>details of the registration of the death</li>
</ul>

<p>If all the relevant documents are submitted the Certificate of Death will be issued within one working week. The Registrar Generals Office is open Monday to Friday from 08h00 to 17h00 (local time) and is closed on public holidays.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Identification of the deceased</h2>

<p>The next of kin or 3 family members of the deceased would need to identify the body. If the next of kin is not in Zimbabwe and the deceased had no family members in Zimbabwe then the deceased would be identified by the appointed funeral director.</p>

<p>The funeral director would need an affidavit from the next of kin and a certified copy of a photographic identity document of the deceased authorising them to identify the body. If the body was not able to be visually identified then Government pathologists would use finger prints or DNA testing to identify the deceased.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>Post mortems are carried out when there is doubt as to how the deceased died, where there is no known medical history, or upon request by the family of the deceased. Post mortems are carried out by appointed forensic doctors or pathologists.</p>

<p>During a post mortem organs can be removed for testing, including toxicological studies at the discretion of the doctor without consent from the next of kin. Next of kin may not be informed about the removal of organs or retention by the Zimbabwean authorities. A copy of the post mortem in English will be made available to next of kin.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>Mortuary facilities vary depending on whereabouts in Zimbabwe they are situated. Temperature controlled mortuaries are found in most major towns or cities but in rural areas these may not be available. We will do everything we can to ensure the deceased is placed in an appropriate mortuary but cannot guarantee the condition of the body of the deceased.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>You will need to decide if you would like a local burial, cremation or bring the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<p>It is possible for a British national to be buried or cremated in Zimbabwe. The funeral director can arrange a private burial or cremation on your behalf.  Cremation facilities are widespread. The funeral director will be able to assist with the paperwork for the return of the ashes to the UK or the ashes could be scattered locally.</p>

<p>If the next of kin cannot be identified, or cannot afford to pay for a funeral, the local mortuary will look to undertake a paupers burial on behalf of the state. A pauper will be buried in a coffin in an unmarked grave at Granville Cemetery.</p>

<p>Should you choose to repatriate the deceased to the UK, the local funeral director in Zimbabwe, working with an international funeral director will be able to arrange this on their behalf. Repatriations can be arranged to most countries in the world.</p>

<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on UK coroners and inquests.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>If the person who died had insurance, check with the insurance company if this covers the return of their personal belongings.</p>

<p>The next of kin or the funeral director would need to make appropriate arrangements for the return of the belongings of the deceased to the UK. The cost of returning the belongings would need to be paid for by the next of kin.</p>

<p>If the deceased was permanently resident in Zimbabwe at the time of death then an executor, often a lawyer will need to be appointed by the next of kin to attend to the matters pertaining to the estate of the deceased.</p>

<p>Please note, the British Embassy cannot take responsibility for the personal belongings of the person who died.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information on the steps to take in the UK online. This includes information on arranging the funeral, telling the government about the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the person who died. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">step-by-step guide about what to do when someone dies</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>The D1 form and instructions on where to send the passport is available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">online</a></p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport to do this. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Child deaths</h2>

<p>Child deaths, burials, cremations and repatriations in Zimbabwe are handled in the same way as adults deaths are. Social services may get involved if they were handling a case which involved the welfare of the child.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Deaths in road traffic accidents</h2>

<p>The police are the lead agency for road traffic investigations and have the primary duty to investigate and establish the circumstances that have led to road deaths. The investigating police officer prepares a full report that contains additional information, for example witness statements and a post-mortem report.</p>

<p>It can take the police a long time to gather all the evidence they need and prepare the full report. Persons found guilty of dangerous or negligent driving will be found guilty of committing an offence and will be made to pay a fine or be sentenced to time in prison.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">find more about how the FCDO can help with murder and manslaughter abroad</a>.</p>

<p>You should note that if the deceased is repatriated to parts of the UK a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest.</p>

<p>If you have questions or would like advice on this section contact, the Head of the Murder and Manslaughter Team (MMT).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> UK coroners and inquests</h2>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner. Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note, Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>

<span class="number">19. </span> Legal Aid</h2>

<p>Legal Aid is available to persons in Zimbabwe. Legal Aid is referred to as the offering of services by lawyers through consultation, advice or representation in court or before administrative tribunals to persons unable to pay for a lawyer because of inadequate means or resources.</p>

<p>The aim of legal aid is to ensure that less fortunate people have access to justice on an equal basis to everyone else. More information can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://justice.gov.zw/departments/legal-aid-directorate/" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
