<h2>Working as a teacher in England if you qualified outside the UK</h2>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the correct visa or status</li>
  <li>teaching skills and experience you can demonstrate to an employer</li>
  <li>to pass criminal and professional safeguarding checks (these will be organised by your employer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The correct visa or status could be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a job offer allowing you to apply for a skilled worker visa</li>
  <li>eligibility for another type of visa</li>
  <li>a pre-existing right to work in the UK, such as settled or pre-settled status under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families" class="govuk-link">EU Settlement Scheme</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/indefinite-leave-to-remain-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">indefinite leave to remain in the UK</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Irish citizens <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance" class="govuk-link">do not need a visa to work or live in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>It is also very helpful to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a teaching qualification (this can be from your own or another non-UK country)</li>
  <li>English ‘qualified teacher status’ (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/">Get into Teaching</a> for general information and support about being a teacher in England, including details on salaries and benefits.</p>

<h3>Qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>International qualified teachers can work as a teacher in England for up to 4 years without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>. Learn more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/recruit-teachers-from-overseas#employing-overseas-teachers-without-qts-the-4-year-rule">4-year rule</a>.</p>

<p>In some schools in England, <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is not a legal requirement. You can be employed as a teacher without <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies" class="govuk-link">academy schools</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/free-schools" class="govuk-link">free schools</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools" class="govuk-link">private schools</a> or independent schools</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, in many <a href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school" class="govuk-link">state schools</a>, teachers must have <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>. Even where <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> is not a legal requirement, the majority of English schools use it to assess the quality of candidates for teaching jobs.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk">Apply for QTS if you teach, or have teaching experience, outside the UK</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Visas and immigration</h2>

<p>This section explains the visas and immigration routes you may be able to use to work in England.</p>

<h3>Check if you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme</h3>

<p>If you’re from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a> or Switzerland, you might be able to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living, working and studying in the UK without applying for a visa.</p>

<p>The deadline for most people to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme was 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>If you or your family are from the <abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr> or Switzerland, you can still apply if you or a family member were living in the UK by 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>You must also either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meet one of the criteria for a later deadline to apply</li>
  <li>have ‘reasonable grounds’ for not applying by 30 June 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>More information is available about the eligibility criteria for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families" class="govuk-link">later applications to the EU Settlement Scheme</a>.</p>

<p>You can also apply to the EU Settlement Scheme if you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/switch-from-presettled-status-to-settled-status">already have pre-settled status and are applying for settled status</a>. You must apply to the EU Settlement Scheme again before your pre-settled status expires to stay in the UK.</p>

<h3>Apply for a skilled worker visa</h3>

<p>The main visa route for non-UK teachers in England is the skilled worker visa.</p>

<p>To apply for a skilled worker visa, you will first need to search for a teaching job in England. You can use the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-teaching-job">Teaching vacancies service</a> to search for available teaching roles.</p>

<p>Before you apply for a teaching job, you will need to find out if the school is a Home Office licensed employer sponsor. Sometimes it will be the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school">local authority or academy trust</a> that holds the sponsor licence instead of the individual school. You could check the Home Office’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers" class="govuk-link">Register of licensed sponsors: workers</a> but you should also check directly with the school. Sponsors can help you apply for your visa, and schools can apply to be employer sponsors in order to employ you.</p>

<p>You’ll be able to apply for your skilled worker visa if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a job offer from a school that is a licensed Home Office employer sponsor</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/knowledge-of-english" class="govuk-link">you can speak, read, write, and understand English</a></li>
  <li>your salary meets the requirements for a skilled worker visa</li>
</ul>

<h4>Salary requirement for a skilled worker visa</h4>

<p>The salary threshold you must meet depends on your qualification status and region.</p>

<p>This table shows the minimum salary non-UK teachers must earn to be eligible for a skilled worker visa, by region and status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and non-<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <th scope="col">Inner London</th>
      <th scope="col">Outer London</th>
      <th scope="col">London fringe</th>
      <th scope="col">Rest of England</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</th>
      <td>£32,157</td>
      <td>£29,915</td>
      <td>£26,948</td>
      <td>£25,714</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Non-<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>
</th>
      <td>£23,099</td>
      <td>£21,832</td>
      <td>£20,480</td>
      <td>£20,480</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These thresholds match the minimum salaries on the national teachers’ pay ranges, except for the non-<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> rates in the London fringe and the rest of England, where the threshold is the minimum for a skilled worker visa.</p>

<h4>Working part time as a teacher</h4>

<p>You can work part time, but your salary must meet the threshold for a skilled worker visa. There are 2 requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your part-time salary must be at least £20,480</li>
  <li>the full-time equivalent of your salary must meet the minimum set for your region and status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> or non-<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Schools have some flexibility in how they set salaries. You may be able to negotiate a different rate of pay if the salary on offer does not meet the skilled worker visa requirements.</p>

<p>The salary requirements for a skilled worker visa apply whatever type of school you work in (funded by the UK government or in the private sector).</p>

<h3>Work as a teacher in England without a skilled worker visa</h3>

<p>This section explains the other visa and immigration routes you may be able to use to work as a teacher in England.</p>

<h4>Graduate visa</h4>

<p>If you’re already an international student in the UK, you can apply for a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa">graduate visa</a> on successful completion of your degree. To apply, you’ll need to have been sponsored by a Home Office licensed student sponsor over the course of your studies.</p>

<p>The graduate visa will allow you to work, or look for work, in the UK for up to 2 years after completing your studies (3 years for PhD students) without a sponsor. This includes working as a teacher.</p>

<p>You will be able to switch from a graduate visa to another visa (such as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#s1wml73ydjbo" class="govuk-link">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK if you meet the requirements for the other visa.</p>

<h4>The Youth Mobility Scheme visa</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-youth-mobility" class="govuk-link">Youth Mobility Scheme</a> allows young people from certain countries to come to the UK each year to study or work without a sponsoring educational institution or sponsoring employer. This includes working as a teacher.</p>

<p>A Youth Mobility Scheme visa lasts up to 2 years. You may be able to switch from a Youth Mobility Scheme visa to another visa route (for example the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk/teach-in-england-if-you-qualified-outside-the-uk#kix.rh0f9xocaw11">skilled worker visa</a>) without having to leave the UK. You’ll need to meet the requirements for the other visa route.</p>

<h4>Other visas</h4>

<p>Depending on your personal circumstances, you may be able to work in the UK on alternative visas – for example, a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa" class="govuk-link">Family visa</a>, a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ancestry-visa" class="govuk-link">UK Ancestry visa</a> or, if you’re from Hong Kong, a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa">British National (Overseas) visa</a>.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa" class="govuk-link">check if you need a UK visa</a>.</p>

<h2>International travel during coronavirus (COVID-19)</h2>

<p>Global travel, including to the UK, is affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). If you’re a non-UK national, check your country’s advice as well as the UK’s advice to find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">what you must do before you travel to England and after you arrive</a>. This includes what COVID-19 tests you need to take and the quarantine rules for travel to England.</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents#outside-uk" class="govuk-link">what to do if you need a visa to travel to the UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Early career teacher (<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>) induction for teachers in England</h2>

<p>Teachers who gain qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>) through the <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/specialist-training-options/assessment-only" rel="external" class="govuk-link">assessment only</a> or <a href="https://beta-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/ways-to-train" class="govuk-link" rel="external">English teacher training routes</a> will be able to apply for paid teaching jobs in all schools in England.</p>

<p>Many schools will also require you to complete an early career teacher (<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr>) 2-year induction period, when you’ll work and be assessed as a paid teacher in a school. This induction period is part of the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework">early career framework</a> for teachers. You’ll be expected to show you meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a> and you’ll also get training and support from a mentor.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> exemptions</h3>

<p>In some circumstances, depending on your teaching experience, you may be exempt from some or all of <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction.</p>

<p>You will not have to undergo <abbr title="early career teacher">ECT</abbr> induction if you’re applying to the Teaching Regulation Agency for a fast-track <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and you’re a teacher who qualified in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">European Economic Area (<abbr title="European Economic Area">EEA</abbr>)</a>
</li>
  <li>Australia</li>
  <li>Canada</li>
  <li>New Zealand</li>
  <li>the USA</li>
