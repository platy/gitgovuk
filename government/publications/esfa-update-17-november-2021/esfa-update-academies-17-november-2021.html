<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: changes to T Level Policy and the post 16 qualifications review timetable</h2>

<p>On Monday 15 November, the Secretary of State announced some changes to T Level Policy and the post-16 qualifications review timetable.</p>

<p>Following feedback from providers, we have made changes to:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>the English and maths requirements for T Levels.  </li>
  <li>the timeline for the reform of level 3 qualifications</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Changes to the English and Maths requirement for T Levels </h3>

<p>Until now T Level students have been required to achieve either a grade 4 in English and maths GCSE or level 2 in functional skills in order to pass their T Level. Following feedback from providers we have agreed with the Institute to remove the exit requirement with immediate effect for all T Level students, bringing T Levels into line with other level 3 post-16 programmes, such as A levels. We will provide guidance shortly on how this will be implemented.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Changes to timeline for reform of level 3 qualifications  </h3>

<p>The Secretary of State has announced plans allowing an extra year before our Level 3 reform timetable is implemented. This extra year will allow us to continue to work hard to support the growth of T Levels and gives more notice to providers, awarding organisations, employers, students and parents so that they can prepare for the changes. We will be writing with more detail to all providers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: update to the 16 to 19 funding guidance</h2>

<p>We have had some questions raised following the pandemic that some providers may replace national qualifications with employment, enrichment and pastoral activity and some students’ study programmes would then be inconsistent with the requirements set out in the Wolf review.</p>

<p>As a result, study programmes where non-qualification hours form the majority of total planned hours will, from this academic year, attract a higher level of funding audit scrutiny. This may include the need to provide evidence of recognised educational costs which is set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advice-funding-regulations-for-post-16-provision" class="govuk-link">annex B of our funding regulations</a>. This does not include study programmes for High Needs and/or learners with education health and care plans because we recognise that for some of these students, higher levels of non-qualification activity may be appropriate.</p>

<p>We have updated our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance" class="govuk-link">funding guidance documents</a> and any changes are clearly shown in the ‘what’s new section’. We will add a new report to our existing reports to help providers identify the students that are likely to fall under higher funding audit scrutiny.</p>
