<span class="number">2. </span>Information: Find a further education service - new calendar feature</h2>

<p>In February we added <a rel="external" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/categories/360003071260" class="govuk-link">Find a further education service</a>, which is a starting page that links to key ESFA services and the funding rules.</p>

<p>The page sits on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/">Get help with Education and Skills Funding Agency</a> services which is a help centre hosted by ESFA. You can search help articles or discussions between training providers about further education and skills topics, for self-serve support.</p>

<p>If you have any further suggested dates for the calendar, please let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:customer.experience@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">customer.experience@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Reminder: ESFA  AEB Learner Support Funds can be used to support IT</h2>

<p>Paragraphs 250 to 254 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/adult-education-budget-aeb-funding-rules-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">version 5 of the AEB funding rules for 2020 to 2021</a> explain how learner support funds can be used to support learners to access IT if they are unable to undertake online delivery in the event of local or national measures in response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The rules set out how the funds can be used, and what evidence must be retained.</p>

<p>You will need to include any expenditure relating to this in your year-end forecast funding claim in June and your final funding claim in October.</p>

<p>Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-funding-claims/how-to-submit-a-funding-claim-for-2020-to-2021">funding claims guidance</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: publication of a new manual to support flexible apprenticeships in construction</h2>

<p>A new manual, co-authored by Industry and Government, has been published to set out how flexibilities in apprenticeships can be used and delivered in construction.</p>

<p>The ‘<a rel="external" href="https://www.ecitb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Updated-May-2021_CSDG-cleared-flexible-apprenticeships-manual-construction_final.pdf" class="govuk-link">Flexible Apprenticeships in Construction</a>’ manual explains how apprenticeship training can be flexed, including what is delivered and when, based on the existing relevant knowledge or skills of the apprentice.</p>

<p>It includes information about the various delivery models including front loading and accelerated apprenticeships.
You may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-to-create-new-flexible-apprenticeships" class="govuk-link">consultation launched to deliver new flexi-job apprenticeships</a> in industries where employment is often short term, such as the creative sector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: qualification achievement rates</h2>

<p>High level national summaries of qualification achievement rates (QARs) for the 2019 to 2020 academic year were made available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/further-education-and-skills-statistical-first-release-sfr" class="govuk-link">further education and skills</a>, and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/further-education-and-skills-statistical-first-release-sfr">apprenticeships and traineeships statistics publications</a> for March 2021.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-school-and-college-performance-measures/coronavirus-covid-19-school-and-college-accountability" class="govuk-link">previously confirmed</a>, for 2019 to 2020, that we will not publish any institution-level QARs in the national achievement rate tables for the 2019 to 2020 in response to COVID-19. We also announced that data will not be used by others, such as Ofsted, local authorities or devolved authorities or within ESFA and DfE, to hold institutions to account. Therefore, we will not supply 2019 to 2020 QARs for institutions to use internally themselves.</p>

<p>For 2020 to 2021, the approach for QARs will align with that for school and college performance tables.  Further detail will be provided in the following documents to be published by the end of May on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards" class="govuk-link">QAR webpage</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>qualification achievement rates business rules 2020 to 2021</li>
  <li>apprenticeship qualification achievement rates technical specification 2020 to 2021</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: New guide for training providers - how to deliver high-quality apprenticeships</h2>

<p>We have published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provider-guide-to-delivering-high-quality-apprenticeships" class="govuk-link">new guide online</a>, which gives training providers step-by-step advice for delivering high-quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Informed by providers, apprentices and the quality bodies, this guide is for all providers delivering apprenticeships at any level.</p>

<p>For new providers, it brings together the minimum requirements and building blocks required to deliver high-quality apprenticeships.</p>

<p>For experienced providers, it is a reminder of good practice, available support, and the latest requirements to support continuous improvement.</p>

<p>It also contains links to detailed, specific guidance on topics such as off the job training, ‘gateway’ and end point assessment.</p>

<p>We are also seeking feedback on the usefulness and impact of this guide in your organisations. If you would like to share your thoughts, you can email us at <a href="mailto:apprenticeships.qualitypolicy@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">apprenticeships.qualitypolicy@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
