<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: mid-year funding claims for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>The mid-year funding claim window will open at 9am on Monday 8 February 2021. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone, and time and resources are under strain.</p>

<p>However, we will still require you to submit an accurate mid-year claim so we have visibility of the challenges you are facing, which will inform the design of the year end reconciliation process.</p>

<p>Please submit your mid-year funding claim by 5pm on Friday 19 February 2021. This is slightly later than we originally published. The claim form will be available on <a href="https://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Submit Learner Data</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to submit a claim if you receive funds through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>grant funded – ESFA Adult Education Budget (AEB) (Adult Skills, Community Learning, 19 to 24 Traineeships and Covid-19 skills offer)</li>
  <li>learner support for ESFA AEB procured (Adult Skills and 19 to 24 Traineeships) – paid-on-profile</li>
  <li>grant funded - Advanced Learner Loans Bursary (ALLB)</li>
</ul>

<p>The form will include your R06 ILR and Earnings Adjustment Statement (EAS) data and will be available from 9am on Monday 8 February 2021. You must include your forecasts for the remainder of the 2020 to 2021 funding year.</p>

<p>Once you have submitted your mid-year funding claim on Submit Learner Data, you will also be able to view it on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/">Manage your education and skills funding</a>.</p>

<p>You will not be able to complete the form after the deadline on Friday 19 February 2021.</p>

<span class="number">2. </span>Information: 2020 to 2021 ESFA grant funded adult education budget (AEB) reconciliation</h2>

<p>Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including transferring all learning to online delivery where possible from 5 January, we are currently reviewing the end of year grant funded AEB reconciliation position for 2020 to 2021. We are looking at this in recognition of the difficulties and uncertainties many providers are facing.</p>

<p>We will communicate any changes to the published arrangements through Update in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In areas where the AEB has been devolved, MCAs/GLA are responsible for considering any provider flexibilities in their areas.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Find an end-point assessment organisation</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://find-epao.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/">Find an end-point assessment organisation</a> is a new function the apprenticeship service has developed to enable employers and training providers to find end-point assessors that deliver assessments for the standard their apprentice is completing.</p>

<p>The function allows employers and providers to search for the apprenticeship training that needs to be assessed and view all available end-point assessors who can deliver the assessment. If there is more than one assessment organisation for the selected standard, you will be shown a list of all available organisations to choose from.</p>

<p>For any queries, please contact the Apprenticeship Service on 08000 150 600.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: ILR validation rules for 2020 to 202</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://guidance.submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/previous/20-21/ilr/appendices" rel="external" class="govuk-link">sixth version of the ILR validation rules for 2020 to 2021</a> has now been published.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: monitoring post-16 funding</h2>

<p>We have published R05 data on the post-16 monitoring reports dashboard on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">View your education data</a>. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules#monitoring-the-funding-rules-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">Post-16 monitoring reports dashboard user guide 2020 to 2021</a> explains how to access the reports and any actions you must take to ensure data is correct.</p>

<p>Please ensure that you, or other members of your team, have a user account with the appropriate permissions to allow you to view and download the data before we begin contacting providers after R06. In addition to asking you make corrections, we may ask you to provide evidence to support some data. Annex C of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules#monitoring-the-funding-rules-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">Post-16 monitoring reports dashboard user guide 2020 to 2021</a> indicates what action we will take to assure data and funding; we have also summarised this information on the landing page of the dashboard.</p>

<p>In response to user feedback, we have identified and subsequently resolved several issues in the R05 release of the reports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some users have tried, but been unable, to download data. The ‘underlying data’ option is an export of disaggregated data and is currently unavailable. To download the data, users only have the ‘summarised data’ export option. This option allows users to export the aim level data shown in the summarised data tab, as described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules#monitoring-the-funding-rules-2020-to-2021">user guide</a>. We have changed some of the wording in the dashboard to reduce confusion around this. The tab previously called ‘underlying data’ is now called ‘summarised data’ to reflect the option that users need to select when exporting data.</li>
  <li>We identified an issue causing some ULNs in the summarised data to be displayed with more than 10 digits. We have now updated the column settings and fixed the issue so ULNs display correctly. The fix will also update your R04 data, so you may need to re-export this if you want to reuse the R04 data.</li>
  <li>We identified an issue in the way records were being matched in report ‘FRM42 - Work experience over 300 hours not recorded as core aim’. This meant that the report did not show the work experience aim (the matching aim) that corresponded with the core aim we investigated. We have now fixed this, and the data should display correctly. You must review this data and ensure you have correctly identified the learner’s core aim.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any further feedback on the dashboard, please contact us using the feedback button on the landing page. If you need further support to resolve errors, please <a href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external" class="govuk-link">submit an enquiry</a>.</p>
