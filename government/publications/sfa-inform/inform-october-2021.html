<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: Qualification Achievement Rates 2020 to 2021 updates to supporting documents</h2>

<p>We have now updated the Traineeship Qualification Achievement Rates Technical Specification 2020 to 2021 to include the table showing the breakdown of the fields we will include in your traineeship QAR data set.</p>

<p>Alongside this update, following feedback from providers, we have also provided clarification across the business rules and technical specifications including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>update to the contact details in the event of any queries in relation to QAR</li>
  <li>correction to omission that pass and retention rates will not be calculated for Traineeships</li>
  <li>correction to omission of T Level and T Level Transition Programme aims we exclude from QARs</li>
</ul>

<p>These documents provide technical information about how we produce the QAR dataset and should be read alongside the business rules, which explain the methodology for calculating QARs for 2020 to 2021 and can be accessed on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">qualification achievement rates 2020 to 2021</a> on GOV.UK</p>

<p>The next QAR data release will be provisional data based on your final R14 data return expected in January 2022.   At that stage, provisional data cannot be amended as the R14 data return is final.</p>

<p>We would therefore encourage providers to continue to review the in-year QAR dashboards based on R12 available now via <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/">View Your Education Data</a>.</p>

<p>These provide indicative QARs for apprenticeships, education and training and traineeships and the opportunity to identify and resolve potential data issues prior to the ILR R14 hard close on 21 October 2021. </p>

<p>Please review your ILR data before you make your final R14 submission. You will not be able to amend your 2020 to 2021 data after the R14 hard close.</p>

<h2>
