<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: Changes to the way you access the Manage your Education and Skills Funding service.</h2>

<p>We have published a blog on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://feconnect.education.gov.uk/blog/uncategorized/the-way-you-access-the-manage-your-education-and-skills-funding-service-is-changing/">feconnect</a> detailing the changes of moving from ESFA Idams to the DfE sign in service. These changes take place from 2 March 2020</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: R04 funding monitoring reports published</h2>

<p>We have published the R04 funding monitoring reports on <a href="https://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Submit Learner Data</a>. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules" class="govuk-link">funding monitoring reports user guide 2019 to 2020</a> explains how to access the reports and any actions you must take to ensure data is correct.</p>

<p>For each report we have indicated the actions we will take if we are not satisfied your data complies with the rules. This will include funding recoveries or requesting further evidence to support your claim for funding.</p>

<p>This year, in addition to the funding streams monitored in previous years, we have included the following streams:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>16 to 19 funding – we have included this provision in reports where we have detected similar issues to those in adult skills and apprenticeship provision. While we will not recover funding from these records in the same way we handle other errors at the end of the year, we may contact outlier institutions to discuss the data further. We will only review data you submit through the ILR, not through the schools census.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Devolved adult funding – we have included devolved funding in our reports to support you. However, we do not have responsibility for assuring this provision or recovering any funding at the end of the year, as this responsibility lies with the relevant authority. We will share this data with devolved authorities and will treat this separately in your reports.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have also published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules" class="govuk-link">known issues log</a>, which tracks issues that are affecting the suite of reports, and the dates we expect to resolve these. 
There are two active known issues relating to apprenticeships payments data; we are applying further quality assurance checks to the FRM reports that use this data before we include the payment values in the reports.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: qualification achievement rates (QAR)</h2>

<p>QARs will continue to be published in March 2020 through the National Achievement Rate tables. However, the new transparency reporting table will be published alongside <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-achievement-rates-tables-transparency-data">NARTs transparency tables</a> at the same time. Please read this document alongside the 2018 to 2019 QAR <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2018-to-2019" class="govuk-link">business rules and the technical specification</a> to review your QAR data.</p>

<p>We have also published the following documents on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards" class="govuk-link">QAR webpage</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>QAR business rules 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>Technical specification 2018 to 2019 (version 3)</li>
  <li>Data extract guidance (version 3)</li>
  <li>Transparency reporting plans for 2018 to 2019</li>
</ul>

<h3>

  <li>A grant with an Advanced Learner Loans Bursary contract</li>
  <li>A Learner Support (for Procured AEB) contract</li>
</ul>

<h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Action: Recording supported internships</h2>

<p>Please ensure that supported internships are correctly recorded with learning aim ‘Z0002347’.</p>

<p>We are aware of some colleges who are offering this study programme but no learners are appearing with this learning aim in the data.</p>

<p>There have been instances where work experience has been incorrectly recorded with this learning aim and the learner has been incorrectly identified as participating in a supported internship.
Further information on the correct recording of supported internships can be found in the <a href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Learning%20Aims/Search-results/Details/Pages/Key-and-Aim-details.aspx?UODID=Z0002347&amp;ty=1920" rel="external" class="govuk-link">LARS database</a>.</p>

<p>The fourth version of the ILR Validation Rules for 2019 to 2020 has now been published and is available to view on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-specification-validation-rules-and-appendices-2019-to-2020" class="govuk-link">gov.uk</a></p>

<span class="number">12. </span>Information: apprenticeship service for SMEs now open!</h2>

<p>Smaller employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy now have full access to the apprenticeship service.  The service opened on 9 January and those employers who feel ready to use the service will have greater control over choosing their apprenticeship, as well as their training provider and will be able to access funding and the range of other benefits the service offers.</p>

<p>This follows our announcement at the end of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-update-30-october-2019/esfa-update-further-education-30-october-2019">October 2019</a> that we would be embarking on a managed transition to allow smaller employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy to access the benefits of the award-winning apprenticeship service.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service/index" class="govuk-link">Registration is open on the apprenticeship service</a>.</p>

<p>We want employers and training providers to have time to prepare and take full advantage of the move onto the service, at the same time ensuring stability in the marketplace.  So, from now until March the transition period will start with an initial ‘test phase’.  We will seek feedback from smaller employers who register and recruit through the service and from providers working with those employers.  We will monitor how the system is working, along with employer and training provider behaviour, this includes keeping under review how the reservation policy is working.</p>

<p>We also announced that to support transition additional funding would be made available for up to 5,000 new starts through the service, per month, between January and March 2020. Access to the additional funding will be open to all main providers that remain listed on the register of apprenticeship training providers (RoATP), not just those with an existing procured non-levy contract if they are selected by a smaller employer.</p>

<p>As we enable smaller employers to use the apprenticeship service, we are introducing the ability for them to <a rel="external" href="https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service/index" class="govuk-link">reserve</a> funds for training. We have published an updated versions of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">Funding Rules</a> and new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding">Reservations Policy Statement</a>.</p>

<p>This will allow us to forecast, monitor and manage apprenticeships funding within the overall budget for apprenticeships. To manage a gradual transition from contracted training provision to employers arranging their own apprenticeships through the apprenticeship service, employers will initially be able to reserve funding for up to three apprenticeships. Employers will still be able to access training via existing procured non-levy contracts, and we will extend these contracts beyond March 2020 to help facilitate a managed transition during the year as we bring all smaller employers onto the apprenticeship service. A narrated presentation to explain the funding rule updates will be published soon.</p>

<p>We have <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://engage.apprenticeships.gov.uk/providers-nl">written to all existing providers</a> about how the changes will affect contracting arrangements; this includes details of change to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding-legal-agreement-for-training-providers" class="govuk-link">provider</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreement-between-an-employer-and-the-education-and-skills-funding-agency-esfa" class="govuk-link">employer</a> agreements.</p>
