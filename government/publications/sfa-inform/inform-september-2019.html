<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: Individualised Learner Record (ILR) for apprenticeships - R14 hard close</h2>

<p>It is critical that you make any amendments to your 2018 to 2019 apprenticeship ILR data before the hard close at 6pm on Thursday 17 October.</p>

<p>After this date, you will not be able to fix any data match issues from your 2018 to 2019 ILR return and will not receive payment for activity relating to August 2018 to July 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Qualification achievement rates 2018 to 2019</h2>

<p>We are now approaching the final ILR data collection for 2018 to 2019; we use the final R14 data to calculate qualification achievement rates (QARs) and minimum standards.</p>

<p>We have released the R12 in-year qualification achievement rate (QAR) data for 2018 to 2019 on both the Hub and <a href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">View Your Education Data</a> dashboard. The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/809763/190619_In_year_QAR_2018_2019_V4_FINAL.docx.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">in-year QAR guidance</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2018-to-2019" class="govuk-link">QAR webpage</a> provide details about this data release and accessing the dashboard.</p>

<p>If you have identified any issues in your 2018 to 2019 data, then these must be resolved before the R14 hard close on 17 October 2019.</p>

<p>Any data issues in your final R14 data for this year will affect your 2018 to 2019 QARs.
Please review your Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data before you make your final R14 submission; you will not be able to amend your 2018 to 2019 data after the R14 hard close.</p>

<p>We have listed some of the common data issues affecting QARs, but you can find further information and guidance in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-inform/inform-may-2019#commonissuesQAR" class="govuk-link">common data issues and funding monitoring reports</a> and other documents available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards">QAR webpage</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-business-operations-help-and-support" class="govuk-link">service desk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>QAR: Overdue planned breaks</h3>
<p>We flag a record as an overdue planned break when we cannot find a corresponding restart record in the same or following funding year; we treat these as withdrawals in the QAR calculations.</p>

<p>These aims are identified in your QAR data extract by a value of 1 in the column Overdue_Planned_Break. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules" class="govuk-link">funding rules monitoring report</a> FRM08 can also help you identify overdue breaks.</p>

<p>When a learner returns from a break in learning, you must follow the guidance in the <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790662/ProviderSupportManual_18_19_v2.1.pdf" class="govuk-link">provider support manual</a> about how to record this. If a learner withdraws without returning from their break in learning, then you must update the ILR to reflect this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>QAR: Overdue continuing aims</h3>
<p>We flag continuing records from 2017 to 2018, that you do not subsequently report in 2018 to 2019, as overdue continuing aims. We treat these as withdrawals in the QAR calculations.</p>

<p>These aims are identified in your QAR data extract by a value of 1 in the column Overdue_Continuing_Aims. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules" class="govuk-link">funding rules monitoring</a> report FRM06 can also help you identify continuance issues.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Apprenticeship service help videos</h2>

<p>In the run-up to R14 close, these videos will help you understand data mismatches (often called data locks), what can cause them and how to resolve them.</p>

<p>We’ve also published guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-fix-apprenticeship-service-data-mismatches" class="govuk-link">how to fix apprenticeship service data mismatches</a>, what they mean and how to fix them.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Apprenticeship technical funding guide has been updated</h2>

<p>We have published version 2 of the Apprenticeships technical funding guide for April 2019 to March 2020.</p>

<p>This explains how funding will work for apprenticeship frameworks and standards starting on or after 1 April 2019, including how we will calculate provider payments.</p>

<p>The main additions from the previous guidance are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the impact of the ILR changes from 1 August 2019; mainly on how to record completions and achievements for apprenticeship standards</li>
  <li>new guidance for how to record late data in your ILR</li>
  <li>new guidance for providers with apprenticeships following a merger</li>
</ul>

<p>For all starts before 1 April 2019 please refer to version 4 of the Apprenticeships technical funding guide for starts from May 2017.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Apprenticeship assessment service updates</h2>

<p>The Apprenticeship assessment service has been updated to include an application programming interface (API) that will allow users to record the outcome of end-point assessments that have been carried out.</p>

<p>This new feature offers much more flexibility when recording end-point assessment outcomes.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/record-a-grade-api" class="govuk-link">record a grade guidance</a> on GOV.UK</p>

<p>The assessment service has also been updated to enable end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) with user permissions to edit their organisation’s details on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations">‘Register of end-point assessment organisations’</a>.</p>

<p>Users can update:</p>

<ul>

  <li>organisation telephone number</li>
  <li>organisation address</li>
  <li>organisation email address</li>
  <li>organisation website address</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Final month to complete DfE’s Education and Training Professionals Survey</h2>

<p>Deadline looming – there is only one month left to take part in DfE’s Education and Training Professionals Survey. Thank you to everyone who has completed the survey so far.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet, there is still time to take part and make sure you are represented.</p>

<p>IFF Research are continuing to contact eligible providers for the HR telephone survey. Providers who agree to take part will be asked to send out a link to the staff survey.</p>

<p>The online survey should take around 10-15 minutes to complete and will ask about qualifications, background, and experiences working in further education, as well as future intentions.</p>

<p>If you think your organisation qualifies to participate and you would like to get involved, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ETPsurvey@iffresearch.com">ETPsurvey@iffresearch.com</a> at IFF Research or <a href="mailto:Rosie.Chalam-Judge@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Rosie.Chalam-Judge@education.gov.uk</a> at the Department for Education.</p>

<p>The findings will be published early next year and these results will be used to guide future policy, so by taking part you will help us support the FE sector.</p>

<p>We continue to see providers waiting until late in a period to submit their first data return. This is a risky approach as you must have a submission with us by the deadline to guarantee your payments.</p>
