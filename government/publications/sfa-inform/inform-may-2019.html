<span class="number">6. </span>Information: Improved Apprenticeship assessment service now live</h2>

<p>Our new digital Apprenticeship assessment service, which improves the process for end-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) submitting applications to assess standards, went live this month.</p>

<p>End-point assessment organisations now have a single service to access all digital activities. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applying to assess an additional apprenticeship standard</li>
  <li>viewing a pipeline of upcoming assessments</li>
  <li>recording apprenticeship end-point assessment grades</li>
  <li>viewing completed assessments</li>
  <li>viewing the standards EPAOs are approved to assess</li>
  <li>viewing organisation details</li>
  <li>signing up to our API service</li>
</ul>

<p>Read our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external">blog</a> to learn more about the new service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: a provider shares their experiences of helping employers transfer apprenticeship funds – watch now</h2>

<p>Hear a provider sharing their experiences of how to work with employers on transfers on a new webinar now live our YouTube channel.</p>

<p>The latest webinar, a walk-through of transfers for providers, took place in May.</p>

<p>Viewers can find out how transfers work, and how providers might support employers through the process as part of the webinar.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMNvQX_aIOux3SdHgg3Iw8D8dPrVHbMY7" rel="external" class="govuk-link">provider webinar can be found on YouTube</a> (number 16) along with other videos and webinar recordings.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: Qualification Achievement Rates (QAR) 2018 to 2019 – key timescales</h2>

<p>We have begun the process for calculating QARs for 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>We have published the business rules, which outline the policy for calculating QARs for apprenticeships and for education and training. We will publish the accompanying technical specifications and extract guidance documents in the middle of June 2019 alongside the business rules on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards" class="govuk-link">QAR webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who completed our QAR survey. We have reviewed the responses and, where possible, we will develop the 2018 to 2019 process to account for this feedback.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Information: in-year QAR release timescales</h3>

<p>We are producing an in-year QAR for 2018 to 2019; this will be available the end of  June 2019.</p>

<p>The in-year QAR will be based on the 2018 to 2019 Individualised Learner Record (ILR) R10 data. Following the recent survey, we will also be releasing an in-year QAR using the R12 ILR data – we will provide timescales on the R12 in-year QAR nearer the time.</p>

<p>You can use in-year QARs internally to identify and resolve potential data issues prior to the ILR R14 hard close on Thursday 17 October 2019. After the R14 hard close, you will not be able to change your 2018 to 2019 ILR data; and neither can we. Therefore, it is important that you review the data and correct any issues before the final 2018 to 2019 R14 collection</p>

<p>Please also review the <a class="govuk-link" href="#commonissuesQAR">common issues article</a> we have published again this year. This document highlights some of the main areas providers struggle with and some actions you can take to rectify any issues. There are also certain <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules">Funding Monitoring reports</a> that affect QARs that you can use to review and correct data.</p>

<p>We will publish two data products as we have done previously; a data extract and a dashboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the data extract will be available through the Hub in the ‘QAR reports’ section.</li>
  <li>the dashboard will be available through the <a href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">View Your Education Data</a> (VYED) portal. This portal replaces the interim excel report we produced through the Hub. Please ensure you have the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-for-an-idams-account">correct access permissions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have made a simple change to the QAR data extracts by combining the included and excluded files together for 2018 to 2019 – this will halve the number of files you need to download.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Information: provisional and final QAR timescales</h3>

<p>We will release provisional QAR data for 2018 to 2019 to individual providers in January 2020, and then we expect to publish final QAR data in March 2020.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Information: qualification achievement rates (QAR) 2017 to 2018</h3>

<p>We will remove your provisional QAR 2017 to 2018 reports from the Hub on Monday 3rd June 2019. They will no longer be available to download after this date.</p>

<p>The data extracts and final reports for your final QAR 2017 to 2018 will still be available in the ‘QAR reports’ section of the Data Returns page on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/">the Hub</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact the Service Desk via email at <a href="mailto:SDE.Servicedesk@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">SDE.Servicedesk@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Action: Qualification Achievement Rates (QARs) 2018 to 2019 - funding monitoring reports and common data issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>Funding Rules Monitoring reports (FRM)</h3>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules" class="govuk-link">FRM reports for 2018 to 2019</a> that identify data issues that affect your QARs. You must review the reports below to ensure your data is accurate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>FRM04 - actual end date changes</h3>

<p>This report relates to changes to the ‘Learning actual end date’ between ILR years.</p>

<p>If you recorded an aim as complete in the previous year’s R14 ILR and continues to be returned in the current year, then you must return the same ‘Learning actual end date’ that you reported in the previous year. You must not amend the ‘Learning actual end date’ between years. Changing this date between years will mean we will not be able to match the learner’s aims, this may generate orphan records that could negatively affect your QARs and may affect your funding.</p>

<p>If a learner undertakes an aim, finished learning, takes the final assessment and fails, then you must close the aim and record it as not achieved. Where this learner is then identified as needing further support or additional learning to pass the assessment, then you must record a new learning aim as a restart, with the ‘Funding adjustment for prior learning’ field completed to account for the new learning required to pass the resit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>FRM05 – planned end date changes</h3>

<p>This report relates to changes in the ‘Learning planned end date’ between funding years.</p>

<p>You must not change or update the ‘Learning planned end date’ after the funding qualifying period has passed. You must not change this date to account for a change in circumstance such as illness, slow progress or unemployment. Changing this date between years will mean we will not be able to match the learner’s aims, this may generate orphan records that could negatively affect your QARs and may affect your funding.</p>

<p>If you identify the planned end date as significantly incorrect or incorrect due to an administrative error, after the 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set the ‘Completion status’ to code 3 ‘withdrawn’ and complete the ‘Withdrawal reason’ using code 40 ‘learner has transferred to a new learning aim with the same provider’</li>
  <li>record a ‘Learning actual end date’ of 1 August 2018</li>
  <li>record a new learning aim with the same ‘Learning aim reference’ and the following:
    <ul>
      <li>a ‘Learning start date’ of 1 August 2018</li>
      <li>the correct ‘Learning planned end date’</li>
      <li>record this aim as a restart (Learning Delivery Funding and Monitoring Type = ‘RES’)</li>
      <li>where appropriate, complete the ‘Funding adjustment for prior learning’ field with the percentage of learning that is still to be delivered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the planned end date changes for reasons other than administrative errors, you must return the data that you reported in R14 of the previous year.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span>FRM06 - continuance issues</h3>

<p>This report relates to continuing learners from 2017 to 2018 who do not appear in the 2018 to 2019 ILR.</p>

<p>We will treat continuing learning aims in the R14 2017 to 2018 ILR that do not have a corresponding record in the 2018 to 2019 ILR as a withdrawal for the overall QAR methodology.</p>

<p>The 2018 to 2019 ILR must include all aims that were reported as continuing (‘Completion status’ = 1 and the ‘Learning actual end date’ is null) in the 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR return.</p>

<p>If you reported the learner as continuing in the 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR return, but subsequently identify them as having withdrawn before 1 August 2018, then you must set the ‘Completion status’ to code 3 (withdrawn) and complete the ‘Withdrawal reason’ field with the relevant code. Record the ‘Learning actual end date’ as the last day the learner was in learning; this date will be in the previous ILR year - do not use 1 August 2018.</p>

<p>If data is incorrect after the 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR due to an administrative error, then you should correct the data and continue to return this for the duration of the 2018 to 2019 ILR. More guidance on correcting errors is available in Section 5.1 of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-guides-and-templates-for-2018-to-2019" class="govuk-link">Provider Support Manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to report an actual end date in 2017 to 2018 for those aims, then you need to ensure your Management Information (MI) system is set up to export 2017 to 2018 learning actual end dates.</p>

<p>For traineeship and apprenticeship programmes, the ILR must include the programme aim and all the associated component aims, even if the component aims are completed and closed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span>Action: common QAR data issues</h3>

<p>To minimise the number of queries for the 2018 to 2019 year, please review the list of common issues below and ensure you make any amendments to your 2018 to 2019 ILR data before the ILR R14 hard close on 17 October 2019.</p>

<p>Once the R14 ILR submission window closes, you will not be able to fix any issues from your 2018 to 2019 ILR return. We cannot change your data on your behalf.</p>

<p>We publish in-year QAR data to help you identify and review potential issues that may affect your final QAR. Please use this data, the in-year guidance and the common issues below to review your data before R14.</p>

<p>We will use the R04 2019 to 2020 ILR data return to identify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late notified apprenticeship achievements</li>
  <li>restarts for learners returning from a planned break</li>
  <li>learners who transferred to a different aim with the same provider within 120 days</li>
  <li>to identify achievements within 90 days (for the timely QAR calculations)</li>
</ul>

<p>The common issues we receive through provider queries include:</p>

<h4>Agreed breaks in learning</h4>

<p>Recording breaks in learning incorrectly can lead to records counting as withdrawn or cause duplicate aims in the QAR calculation.</p>

<p>If you recorded a learner on a planned break with a ‘Completion status’ of 6 (Learner has temporarily withdrawn from the aim due to an agreed break in learning) in your 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR but there is not a corresponding restart record in the same year or by your 2019 to 2020 R04 ILR, then we will treat the planned break as overdue in your 2018 to 2019 QAR.</p>

<p>Overdue planned breaks are counted as withdrawn for your QARs, and have a value of 1 in the ‘Overdue_Planned_Break’ column of your QAR data extract (available on <a rel="external" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">the Hub</a>).</p>

<p>If the learner was recorded as on a planned break in your 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR but has now been identified as withdrawn, you must change the ‘Completion status’ from 6 (planned break) to 3 (withdrawn) and complete the ‘Withdrawal reason’ field with the relevant code. You must not amend any of the dates or other data for the aim.</p>

<p>If the learning aim that the learner was on is no longer available when they return from their break (for example the certification end date has passed), then you cannot class this as a break in learning. 
If you change a completion status from a planned break to a withdrawal where the ‘Learning actual end date’ is before 1 August 2018, check that your Management Information (MI) system can export learning actual end dates that are in previous years.</p>

<p>You must continue to report a break in learning until either the learner returns and restarts their learning, or you report the learner as withdrawn.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules">Funding Monitoring report</a> FRM08 can help you identify aims at risk of being counted as overdue planned breaks. 
You should correct any data entered in error by following the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-guides-and-templates-for-2018-to-2019">Provider Support Manual</a>.</p>

<h4>Continuing learners</h4>

<p>We will treat any learners you reported as continuing in your 2017 to 2018 R14 ILR that are not included in your 2018 to 2019 ILR as overdue.</p>

<p>Overdue continuing aims are counted as withdrawn for your QARs, and have a value of 1 in the ‘Overdue_Continuing_Aims’ column of your QAR data extract (available on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/">the hub</a>).</p>

<p>You can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules">Funding Monitoring report</a> FRM06 to identify these aims, please see the details about <a href="#FRM06" class="govuk-link">FRM06</a> included in the article above.</p>

<h4>Changes to learner reference numbers</h4>

<p>If a learner’s reference number has changed between 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019, then you must record this by completing the ‘Learner reference number in previous year’ field. If you do not return this field then duplicate records will be generated when we try to match the learner’s aims between years. This will have a negative impact on your QAR.</p>

<p>If you return the ‘Learner reference number in previous year’ field when there has not been a change in the learner’s reference number, then this will prevent us from correctly matching the learner’s aims. This will also have a negative impact on your QAR.</p>

<p>The example below illustrates when you should complete the ‘Learner reference number in previous year’ field.</p>

<p>Example: Learner A has a Learner reference number of ‘LNA1234’ in 2017 to 2018. Due to a change in the provider’s management information (MI) system, Learner A has a new Learner reference number in 2018 to 2019 of ‘LRA9876’. This must be recorded in the ILR as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2017 to 2018:
    <ul>
      <li>Learner reference number = LNA1234</li>
      <li>Learner reference number in previous year is not returned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In 2018 to 2019:
    <ul>
      <li>Learner reference number = LRA9876</li>
      <li>Learner reference number in previous year = LNA1234</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In 2019 to 2020:
    <ul>
      <li>Learner reference number = LRA9876</li>
      <li>Learner reference number in previous year is not returned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Recording restarts correctly</h4>

<p>When a learner restarts an aim or programme, you must ensure that you use the restart indicator and the same learning aim or apprenticeship programme aim as the learner originally started. When a learner restarts after a planned break, the ‘Original learning start date’ must exactly match the ‘Learning start date’ of the planned break record. Where the original aim record and restart aim record does not match, the original aim will default to ‘withdrawn’ when we calculate your QAR.</p>

<h4>Transfer exclusions</h4>

<p>Transfers to another provider are only excluded from your QAR where the reason was due to intervention from us, a provider merger or to meet a specific government strategy identified by these ‘Withdrawal Reasons’:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 (Learner has transferred between providers due to intervention by or with the written agreement of the Education &amp; Skills Funding Agency),</li>
  <li>41 (Learner has transferred to another provider to undertake learning that meets a specific government strategy)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also exclude transfers to new learning within the same provider where the learner starts their new aim within 120 days of the end date of the original aim. The exception to this rule is where a learner transfers from an apprenticeship to a non-apprenticeship aim; we treat this type of transfer as a withdrawal.</p>

<h4>Duration of learning calculation</h4>

<p>When calculating the duration of learning for the funding qualifying period exclusion, we count the first day in learning. This means that the duration of learning is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the difference between the ‘Learning start date’ and ‘Learning planned end date’ plus 1 day (if the Learning actual end date is not returned), or</li>
  <li>the difference between the ‘Learning start date’ and the ‘Learning actual end date’ plus 1 day (where the Learning actual end date is returned)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Changes to learning aims between years</h2>

<p>If you change details on a learning aim between years, we will not be able to correctly match those aims in the QAR calculation, which can have a negative impact on your QAR.</p>

<p>If you need to correct an administrative error that was in your R14 2017 to 2018 ILR, please follow the relevant guidance about how to record this in your 2018 to 2019 ILR:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to correct a planned end date, refer to the FRM05 guidance section above</li>
  <li>to correct an actual end date, refer to the FRM04 guidance section above</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to change a learning aim reference, for example if the awarding organisation for the aim has change, you must record this as a transfer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the ‘Completion status’ to code 3 ‘withdrawn’ and complete the ‘Withdrawal reason’ using code 40 ‘learner has transferred to a new learning aim with the same provider’</li>
  <li>record the relevant ‘Learning actual end date’</li>
  <li>record a new learning aim with the new ‘Learning aim reference’, relevant ‘Learning start date’, and the following:
    <ul>
      <li>record this aim as a restart (Learning Delivery Funding and Monitoring Type = ‘RES’)</li>
      <li>where appropriate, complete the ‘Funding adjustment for prior learning’ field with the percentage of learning that is still to be delivered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<span class="number">11. </span>Action: Be prepared for when the Hub’s switched off</h2>

<p>The Hub will be retired in the not too distant future, so now’s the time to get up to speed with its replacement service – <a rel="external" href="http://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">Submit Learner Data</a>.
It’s live now and will run alongside the Hub for the next few months.</p>

<p>We’d like you to upload your files through the new service for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll get familiar with the ‘Submit Learner Data’ so when the Hub is turned off, it’s business as usual</li>
  <li>We can identify things that don’t work as expected and fix them – so there’s no disruption to your payments</li>
  <li>You can compare your reports in Submit Learner Data against your actual reports in the Hub, make sure they’re as expected and report inaccuracies</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Action: EPAO validation switching to an error from R12</h2>

<p>The ESFA we will be switching the EPAOrgID_01 validation rule from a warning to an error from R12. This means that if you record an end-point assessment organisation that has not been approved to carry out the end point assessment for the apprenticeship standard being delivered on your learner data records within your ILR file it will fail validation.</p>

<p>This will result in you not being paid for those learners and any funding previously paid for these learners in 2018 to 2019 will be recovered.</p>

<p>Please make sure that where this data is returned you have recorded the end-point assessment organisation correctly in your R12 data submission to avoid failing validation.</p>

<p>Details of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-end-point-assessment-organisations" class="govuk-link">apprenticeships each end-point assessment organisation</a>  is approved to assess can be found on GOV.UK and this information is updated monthly.</p>
