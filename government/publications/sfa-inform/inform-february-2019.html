<p>In R06 we processed 7,305 files from 1,774 providers. Over 750 providers submitted their first R06 file within the final 3 days of the R06 collection window, 217 of these submitted their first R06 file on the final day.</p>

<p>1,735 ILR files were submitted on the last day of the collection window, which is over 23% of the total files submitted during the entire collection window.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Information: individualised learner record (ILR): R07 for 2018 to 2019</h3>

<p>The ILR R07 data collection for the 2018 to 2019 funding year is now open and will close at 6pm on Wednesday 6 March. As always, we recommend that you submit your data as early as possible and that you review your validation and funding reports that are made available to you on <a href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">the Hub</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to submit an earnings adjustment statement (EAS) and you do not have access to this on the data returns tab in the Hub, please email our service desk at <a href="mailto:sde.servicedesk@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sde.servicedesk@education.gov.uk</a> or call us on 0370 267 0001 to request this.</p>

<span class="number">1.3 </span>Information: ILR Provider Support Manual for 2018 to 2019 (version 2)</h3>

<p>The second version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-guides-and-templates-for-2018-to-2019">ILR provider support manual for 2018 to 2019 has now been published</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Learning Record Service (LRS)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Action: new self-service password reset - March 2019</h3>

<p>In March, LRS will be introducing new functionality for users to reset and change their passwords in the LRS organisation portal.</p>

<p>The new functionality requires individuals to have one unique email address per organisation (UKPRN number) that is only accessible by you (shared emails in the same organisation are not permitted).  If you have a username for more than one organisation, you can use the same email address for each user account.</p>

<p>After the new functionality is released, when you log on for the first time, you will be prompted to verify your email address before you can use the service. Please ensure you enter the correct email address.</p>

<p>An email will be sent to the email account provided.  If you donât receive this email you should review the email address you have added on the portal to ensure it is correct.  When you receive this email it will contain a link to verify the email address.  Once your email is verified you can continue to login into the portal.</p>

<h4>Password reset responsibility</h4>

<p>In future, if you forget your password, you will no longer have to remember answers to your secret questions, instead you can select âI have forgotten my passwordâ and a password reset email will be sent to your verified email address.  The helpdesk and Super users are no longer able to reset passwords.</p>

<p>If your email address changes then itâs each userâs responsibility to ensure their email address is updated in order to use the new password reset process.</p>

<h4>Non-verified email addresses</h4>

<p>If you have not verified your email and have forgotten your password, Super users will have the ability to send an email containing a link for you to verify your email address.  Before resending the link, we recommend, the Super user and user validate the correct email address details held by LRS.   Users will not be able to use the service without a verified email.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Action: important information for Super users</h3>

<h4>Housekeeping</h4>

<p>In preparation for this new functionality, Super users need to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delete unused user accounts.</li>
  <li>validate email details with the user community to ensure the correct information is on LRS.</li>
  <li>identify users using the same or generic email addresses and update these accounts to a unique email address so they can they continue to use LRS</li>
</ul>

<h4>Creating new user accounts</h4>

<p>A temporary password will no longer be created when registering new user accounts. Going forward, users will receive an email to verify their email details and create a password.</p>

<p>Super users will also be able to resend verification emails to new users if their link expires in order to complete the registration.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Action: FE choices employer satisfaction survey will launch next month</h2>

<p>The FE choices employer satisfaction survey will launch in April.  Emails containing login details were sent to eligible providers last week.  The survey will close in May.  If you provide training to employers but have not yet received an email to take part, please email <a href="mailto:enquiries.EFA@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries.EFA@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The FE choices learner satisfaction survey is still open and many responses have already been received, thank you.  The survey closes on 4 May 2019, so there is still time to encourage your learners to have their say.  All participating providers receive a report containing their results. Results are also published on GOV.UK, the Find an apprenticeship and the National Careers Service website to help learners decide where to train.</p>

<p>These surveys aim to provide consistent and comparable information for learners and employers to help them make informed choices about publicly funded education and training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: new ESF documentation to support contracts starting from April 2019</h2>

<p>We are publishing new documentation soon to support the new ESF contracts that start from 1 April. We will publish a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-european-social-fund-esf-funding-rates-and-formula">ESF Funding Rates and Formula document</a> alongside new guidance for your supplementary data returns.</p>

<p>The main funding calculation principles and qualification funding rates have not changed from the previous ESF programme. However, we have changed the format for supplementary data returns and created a new ESF supplementary data example file.</p>

<p>You must continue to follow the existing guidance for all your activity relating to contracts that end before April 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: qualification achievement rates (QAR) 2018 to 2019</h2>

<p>We have published version 1 of the QAR business rules for 2018 to 2019 on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2018-to-2019">QAR 2018 to 2019 webpage</a>.  This document explains the methodology for calculating apprenticeship and education and training QARs for 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>The main methodology has not changed from 2017 to 2018, however we have made some minor amendments and clarifications. Please also review the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-inform/inform-september-2017#r14---qualification-achievement-rates-and-minimum-standards-2016-to-2017" class="govuk-link">common QAR issues article</a>. This relates to a previous year but the common issues continue to apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: advice for employers sending or receiving a transfer of apprenticeship funds</h2>

<p>Are you a provider with employers who are considering making or receiving a transfer? If so please be aware that any employers are sending or receiving funds will both need to have an account on the apprenticeship service.</p>

<p>We have some useful tips to help employers set up an apprenticeship service account.</p>

<p>Each account on the apprenticeship service must include at least one:</p>

<ul>
  <li>account owner</li>
  <li>organisation</li>
  <li>PAYE scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to register a new account on the apprenticeship service the receiving employer will need the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>account ownerâs email address</li>
  <li>organisationâs Companies House number, charity number, or public sector body name</li>
  <li>PAYE schemeâs Government Gateway credentials</li>
</ul>

<p>If the receiving employer cannot find their Government Gateway credentials they should contact the HMRC helpdesk on 0300 200 3200.</p>

<p>For further support on this and other topics, please view our <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://sfadigital.blog.gov.uk/">blog</a> or view at our video:</p>
