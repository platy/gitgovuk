<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: Access to the ESFA Developer Hub</h2>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency is in the process of reviewing all of its online resources and migrating legacy websites with the former sfa.bis.gov.uk Universal Resource Locators (URL) address over to the new education.gov.uk address.</p>

<p>A number of URL’s have already been successfully updated.</p>

<p>Importantly two URLs that are scheduled for migration shortly may require users to take action, these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ESFA Developer Hub - <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://developers.apprenticeships.sfa.bis.gov.uk">https://developers.apprenticeships.sfa.bis.gov.uk</a>, a portal where developers can register an account to access and test our Application Programme Interfaces (API)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the URL associated with the Application interface <a href="https://apis.apprenticeships.sfa.bis.gov.uk" rel="external" class="govuk-link">https://apis.apprenticeships.sfa.bis.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Friday the 6th March 2020, we will be migrating the ESFA Developer Hub from its current URL onto the new URL <a rel="external" href="https://developers.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">https://developers.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk</a>. To continue to access your account on the developer Hub you will need to use the new address.</p>

<p>We will shortly also begin working on the migration of the Application Interface. To ensure there is no interruption to your systems you will need update applications you have created with the Application Interface, with the new URL when it becomes available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: Review of post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below in England - Process for removal of funding approval for qualifications with low and no enrolments</h2>

<p>In the first stage consultation of the review of post-16 qualifications at level 3 and below, which closed in June 2019, the Department outlined its intention to make early progress in removing funding approvals for qualifications with low and no enrolments. This will help to streamline and stabilise the publicly funded offer in advance of further reform.</p>

<p>On 13 February, we set out how we will be taking forward the process to confirm which qualifications with low and no publicly funded enrolments will have public funding approval removed from August 2021. The qualifications in scope of this process were detailed in a list, also published on 13 February.</p>

<p>Awarding Organisations must tell the Department if they believe a qualification should retain approval for public funding. They must do this by 27 March 2020.</p>

<p>We know that in some cases there will be clear reasons why a qualification might have low demand, and we have designed the process to consider this. We will assess the evidence provided by awarding organisations against specific criteria including, for example, that removing funding for a qualification would have a significant adverse impact on particular student groups, occupations or geographical areas.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a qualification on the list, you should contact your awarding organisation.
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/withdrawal-of-funding-approval-from-qualifications-with-low-and-no-publicly-funded-enrolments" class="govuk-link">All relevant information and documentation can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Information: Have your say on adding apprentice’s details</h2>

<p>Have your say! We’ve <a rel="external" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/adding-apprentices-feedback-esfa/" class="govuk-link">released a survey as part of work to improve the process of adding multiple apprentice’s details to the apprenticeship service</a>.</p>

<p>We’d like to hear from training providers.</p>
