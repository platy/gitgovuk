<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Information: feconnect will be replaced by Communities</h2>

<p>From Thursday 10 December, feconnect will be replaced by ESFA Communities.</p>

<p>Feconnect is being replaced by a more robust, accessible service. <a rel="external" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb/community/topics/360000847259-Training-Providers" class="govuk-link">ESFA Communities</a> is now live and so feconnect will be read only from Thursday 10 December 2020. From this date it will not be possible to create or reply to topics or posts. Feconnect users will need to <a href="https://esfa.zendesk.com/auth/v2/login/registration?auth_origin=360001176620%2Ctrue%2Ctrue&amp;brand_id=360001176620&amp;return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fesfahelp.education.gov.uk%2Fhc%2Fen-gb%2Fcommunity%0a%0a%2Ftopics%2F360000847259-Training-Providers&amp;theme=hc" class="govuk-link" rel="external">create a new ESFA communities account</a> to post, reply or subscribe for email alerts.</p>

<p>Please do encourage colleagues to create an account with the new service.</p>

<p>Feconnect will continue to be available as a read only site. We will track usage over the coming months to understand when the site can be closed down.</p>

<p>If you have any questions email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:customer.experience@education.gov.uk">customer.experience@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: 2019 to 2020 final reconciliation statements</h2>

<p>Thank you for submitting your 2019 to 2020 final funding claim.</p>

<p>Reconciliation statements are now available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Manage your education skills and funding</a>. If yours is not yet available, you should be able to view this soon.</p>

<p>They set out the final position for the 2019 to 2020 funding year and will inform the funding that you will be required to repay (if applicable) or over delivery funding that we will pay.</p>

<p>If you have submitted a business case for review, we will send you your reconciliation statement by the end of December after the case has been reviewed.</p>

<p>If you are required to repay funds back to us, we will schedule those repayments from December 2020.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: changes to the individualised learner record (ILR) for the 2021 to 2022 academic year</h2>

<p>Thank you to those who responded on ESFA Communities to our proposed changes to the ILR for 2021 to 2022. We can now confirm the changes taken forward.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Prior Attainment</h3>

<p>Removing the existing prior attainment field and replacing it with a new entity containing level and a date applies field. We will also be adding in Level 2 and Level 3 codes to the lookup table.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Employment Status Monitoring Type</h3>

<p>An indicator to be used in the funding calculation to fund eligible redundant learners.</p>

<p>Further changes may be announced in 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: qualification achievement rates (QARs) and achievement volumes</h2>

<p>We have already announced that we will not publish âqualification achievements ratesâ at institution level as part of the National Achievement Rate Tables (NARTs) for the 2019/20 academic year due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>

<p>However, we will continue to publish achievement âvolumesâ at provider level as part of our National Statistics release at the end of November 2020. This supports a range of uses including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>transparency on where money has been spent</li>
  <li>an understanding of what skills are delivered to the market to enable skills planning</li>
  <li>detail on which areas or providers are supporting certain aims</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, due to adult FE being a demand led system, âlocal areaâ stakeholders such as Mayoral Combined Authorities will also be keen to show achievements.</p>

<p>Achievement âvolumesâ do not include grades achieved, only level, and are not be used for accountability purposes. It is also not possible to replicate the NARTs from this achievement data.</p>

<p>If you have any questions then please contact the DfE stats team: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:FE.OFFICIALSTATISTICS@education.gov.uk">FE.OFFICIALSTATISTICS@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: Find Apprenticeship Training redesign</h2>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: updates to the Learning Records Service portal</h2>

<p>You can expect to see some changes to the look of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://lrs.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">Learning Records Service</a> from early next year.</p>

<p>We have been working to make the service more accessible and in the same style as other gov.uk sites.</p>

<p>The features and data will not change - you will be able to do everything that you could before. We will send an email closer to the time with more details.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: Analyse FE Data (AFED) being release on 17th December 2020</h2>

<p>A new tool has been developed for FE providers that allows you to visualise and analyse your post-ILR submission data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>What AFED will offer</h3>

<p>Youâll be able to view your learner data split by education &amp; training (E&amp;T) and apprenticeships and view both learner and learning aim data points.</p>

<p>Youâll also be able to filter the data by funding models, 3 yearsâ worth of data and individual return periods. We have been able to show an average against providers of the same type, meaning that you can get an idea of how others are performing.</p>

<p>There are 3 âdrill throughsâ- sections that show your data in more detail. The sections are individual aims, demographics and subcontractors. Each section can be filtered, enabling you to tailor the data to your needs.</p>

<p>Every visual and section of data can be exported for you undertake further analyse as you see fit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>How to get access</h3>

<p>The tool will be released on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">view your education data (VYED)</a>. You will need an Identity and Access Management System (IDAMS) account to get access to the tool. Once in VYED, you will also need to request the âView Your Education Data â AFEDâ role.</p>

<p>There is no limit on who can have access from your setting, we want anyone who finds it helpful to have access to it. Your setting âsuper userâ may need to give others access once the tool is available.</p>

<p>You can do this now, so that you are ready to use AFED when it launches on the 17th December.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Funding rules monitoring year-end activity</h2>

<p>Following the final R14 ILR return for 2019 to 2020, we have completed our assurance activities and identified ineligible or over-claimed funding which we need to recover to ensure that providersâ final contract positions are correct. 
We calculated this error value from the following  reports, which we may have written to you about in-year:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Report</th>
      <th scope="col">Area</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

    </tr>

</table>

<p>For provision funded through a contract for services, we will offset the amount against future delivery. We will reflect this offset amount in your January payment.</p>

<p>For provision funded through a grant, we will record an adjustment on your reconciliation statement, to be offset against published tolerances.</p>

<p>We are working with providers and other external partners to improve the way we support providers with data quality or funding eligibility issues in the 2020 to 2021 funding year.</p>

<p>We recently published a new post-16 monitoring reports dashboard in <a rel="external" href="https://viewyourdata.education.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">View your education data</a> alongside simplified <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-financial-assurance-monitoring-the-funding-rules#monitoring-the-funding-rules-2020-to-2021">guidance</a> to support the reports and the dashboard; this should make the actions we require you to take clearer.</p>

<p>We invite you to test and feedback on the dashboard and guidance before we release the 2020 to 2021 reports following the R04 ILR submission.</p>

<p>We will continue to publish additional support materials throughout the year, and we will inform you of these through our usual communication channels such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/esfa-update" class="govuk-link">Update</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-inform" class="govuk-link">Inform</a>.</p>
