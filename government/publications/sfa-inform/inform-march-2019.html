<p>The first product we are releasing through the service will be the qualification achievement rates (QARs) 2017 to 2018 dashboard. The dashboard will contain the same data as your <a href="http://feconnect.education.gov.uk/blog/feconnect-blog/qualification-achievement-rates-qar/final-qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2017-to-2018/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">2017 to 2018 final QARs</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: learning aim class codes 2019 to 2020 and learning aims category codes version 4</h2>

<p>We have published our guide to using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sfa-funding-rates" class="govuk-link">Learning Aim Class Codes 2019 to 2020</a>.</p>

<p>This document sets out the details the classification and coding system to be used to record non-regulated activity in the individualised learner record (ILR) for 2019 to 2020. There are no material changes from the 2018 to 2019 version of this document.</p>

<p>We have also published version 4 of our guide to using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Learning%20Aims/Pages/default.aspx." rel="external">learning aims category codes</a></p>

<p>This document describes the categories used within the Learning Aim Reference Service (LARS) for the 2019 to 2020 academic year (1 August to 31 July). The only change in version 4 is a new code for identifying learning aims specified by the devolved areas for the devolved adult education budget (AEB).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: new European Social Fund (ESF) documentation to support contracts starting from April 2019</h2>

<p>We have published new documentation on gov.uk to support the new ESF contracts that start from 1 April 2019. We have published a new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sfa-european-social-fund-esf-funding-rates-and-formula">ESF Funding Rates and Formula document</a> alongside new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/esfa-european-social-fund-esf-round-2-supplementary-data-collection">guidance for your supplementary data returns</a>.</p>

<p>The main funding calculation principles and qualification funding rates have not changed from the previous ESF programme. However, we have changed the format for supplementary data returns and created a new ESF supplementary data example file.</p>

<p>You must continue to follow the existing guidance for all your activity relating to contracts that end before April 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: updated co-investment rate for all employers</h2>

<p>Employers are required to make co-investment cash contributions in the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the employer is a non-levy paying employer and the apprentice is funded through co-investment</li>
  <li>the employer is a levy paying employer who has spent all of their digital account funds and so the apprenticeship is being fully or partially funded through co-investment</li>
  <li>the negotiated price for the apprenticeship exceeds the funding band, the employer is responsible for the price that is over the funding band.</li>
</ul>

<p>For new starts From 1 April 2019, the rate these employers have to co-invest will be reduced from 10% to 5% for all new apprenticeships, with government funding of 95% provided to cover the remaining costs.</p>

<p>In line with current policy, we will fund apprenticeships started before 1 April 2019 according to the funding rules in place on the first day of the apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Further guidance is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules">apprenticeship funding and performance-management rules for training providers</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: expiry of apprenticeship funds</h2>

<p>Unspent apprenticeship funds expire 24 months after entering an employer’s apprenticeship service account.  To help levy-paying employers, we have updated the finance area of their apprenticeship service accounts to highlight what funds may expire.</p>

<p>Help your employers plan how to use their apprenticeship funds before they expire. Perhaps employers could benefit from taking on new apprentices or using their transfers allowance to fund apprenticeships with other employers.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: update your bookmark for the Employer Data Service</h2>

<p>Earlier this month we moved the domain name that you use to access the Employer Data Service.

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: the FE Choices Employer Satisfaction Survey is now live!</h2>

<p>The FE Choices Employer Satisfaction Survey was launched on the 25 March 2019.  Emails containing login details were sent to eligible providers last month.  The survey will close on the 3 May 2019. If you provide training to employers but have not received an email to take part, please <a href="mailto:enquiries.EFA@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">email us</a>. Many thanks.</p>

<p>The FE Choices Learner Satisfaction Survey is still open and many responses have already been received, thank you.  The survey also closes on the 3 May 2019, so there is still time to encourage your learners to have their say.  All participating providers receive a report containing their results – results are also published on GOV.UK, the Find an apprenticeship service, and the National Careers Service website to help learners decide where to train.</p>

<p>These surveys will provide consistent and comparable information for learners and employers to help them make informed choices about publicly funded education and training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Action: payments and remittance advice - can you help us improve the information we give to schools and colleges?</h2>

<p>We are looking for volunteers to inform our on-going research into the payment reports and remittance advice that ESFA publishes for schools, colleges and other providers.  If you are interested in taking part in any of the pre-release trials for upcoming releases, please email our User Researcher, <a href="mailto:%20Anandhi.DHUKARAM@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">Anandhi Dhukaram</a>.</p>
