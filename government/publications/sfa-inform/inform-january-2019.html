<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Action: individualised learner record (ILR): R06 for 2018 to 2019</h3>

<p>The ILR R06 data collection for the 2018 to 2019 funding year is now open and will close at 6pm on Wednesday 6 February 2019. As always, we recommend that you submit your data as early as possible and that you review your validation and funding reports that are made available to you on the hub.</p>

<p>If you need to submit an earnings adjustment statement (EAS) and you do not have access to this on the ‘Data Returns’ tab in <a rel="external" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" class="govuk-link">the Hub</a>, please email our service desk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SDE.servicedesk@education.gov.uk">SDE.servicedesk@education.gov.uk</a> or call us on 0370 267 0001 to request this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Information: R05 for 2018 to 2019</h3>

<p>In R05 we processed 5,227 files from 1,504 providers. Over 590 providers submitted their first R05 file within the final 3 days of the R05 collection window, 197 of these submitted their first R05 file on the final day.</p>

<p>1,370 ILR files were submitted on the last day of the collection window, which is over 26% of the total files submitted during the entire collection window.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Information: specification of the individualised learner record (ILR) for 2019 to 2020</h3>

<p>The first version of the ILR specification for 2019 to 2020 will be published next week and will be available on our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individualised-learner-record-ilr">ILR guidance page</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Qualification achievement rates (QAR) 2017 to 2018 – provisional data update</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Reminder: query window deadline - Friday 1 February 2019</h3>

<p>Thank you to those who have provided feedback on the provisional QAR 2017 to 2018 data and raised queries.</p>

<p>You have until 5pm on Friday 1 February to inform us of any concerns about how we have implemented our published methodology. To submit a query relating to the provisional data, please complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qualification-achievement-rates-2017-to-2018">data query form</a> and email this to the service desk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SDE.Servicedesk@education.gov.uk">SDE.Servicedesk@education.gov.uk</a>. Please mark your query for  ‘ESFA Business Operations QAR’.</p>

<p>You cannot request fixes or adjustments to your 2017 to 2018 individualised learner record (ILR) data.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Information: version 2 provisional data published</h3>

<p>This week we republished the provisional data extracts and reports to resolve <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="http://feconnect.sfa.bis.gov.uk/blog/uncategorized/qualification-achievement-rates-qar-2017-to-2018-provisional-data-update/">known issues</a>. You can see your republished files as version 2 on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://hub.fasst.org.uk/Pages/default.aspx" rel="external">the Hub</a>.</p>

<p>Some providers have queried why they have data extracts but no reports. This is because the reports are only generated for providers who had leavers in 2017 to 2018, but the data extracts provide data and trend information for three years (2015 to 2016 through to 2017 to 2018). If you do not have a report but believe you should have received one, please contact the service desk and ask them to pass the query onto ‘ESFA Business Operations QAR’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Information: accessing QAR data</h3>

<p>The FE Choices Learner Satisfaction Survey was launched late last year, and many responses have already been received, thank you. The survey closes on Saturday 4 May 2019, so please encourage your learners to have their say.  All participating providers receive a report containing their results – results are also published on GOV.UK, the Find an Apprenticeship service and the National Careers Service website to help learners decide where to train.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Information: join our apprenticeship training provider user research panel</h2>

<p>The apprenticeship service needs your help!</p>

<p>We are looking for training providers to join our Apprenticeship Training Provider User Research Panel to help improve our online services.</p>

<p>It would involve sharing your views on our service and getting a first look at prototypes.</p>

<p>The research is typically held remotely, which means you could take part from your desk and share screens with one of our research team. We would do our best to work around your schedule.</p>

<p>Your participation is always voluntary and you do not have to take part in every session that takes place, you can unsubscribe from the panel at any time.</p>

<p>To join, please fill out <a href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/JoinTPPanel/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">our online form</a> You will be asked some questions which will help make sure you get invited to research that’s relevant to you. We value your privacy, so your answers won’t be shared with anyone else.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: earnings adjustment statement - new guidance video to assist your submissions</h2>

<p>Following changes earlier this year to the way you submit your earnings adjustment statement (EAS), we have produced a video to help you to create and submit a new EAS file.</p>
