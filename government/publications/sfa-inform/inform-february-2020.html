<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: Summary of changes to the ILR for 2020 to 2021</h2>

<p>Thank you to those who responded on feconnect to our proposed changes to the ILR for 2020 to 2021. We can now confirm the changes taken forward.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Apprenticeships</h3>
<p>A mandatory field has been added to collect Off the Job Training Hours – Actual data at the end of the programme.</p>

<p>This is to address the National Audit Office recommendation to monitor actual off the job training provision.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>T-Levels</h3>
<p>Two new programme types have been added to identify T-Level and T-Level transition programmes. T-Level planned hours will also be collected in the existing Planned Hours field.</p>

<p>This is to collect learner data on delivery of T-Levels and provide monitoring to inform funding levels and achievement rates.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Single Learner / Single Provider rule (V59)</h3>
<p>The rule is now mandatory, ensuring each learner is returned only once by a provider.</p>

<p>This is to ensure duplicate records are excluded from the dataset, improving overall data quality.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Devolution</h3>
<p>The number of Devolved Area Monitoring codes (DAM: used to monitor and fund Devolved Authorities’ provision against a learning aim) has been increased from 4 to 6.</p>

<p>This is to provide the Devolved Authorities with more options for their requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Agreement Identifier</h3>
<p>This field has been removed as it fails to resolve mismatches between the data held in the ILR return and the Apprenticeship Service account.</p>

<p>Its removal contributes to our aim to reduce the quantity of data we collect and to increase the overall data quality.</p>

<p>Housekeeping Changes
Some fields and values have been removed (details listed in Summary of Changes page in the ILR specification).</p>

<p>Removal of these fields contributes to our aim to reduce the quantity of data we collect and to increase the overall data quality.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: Return period 5 (R05)</h2>

<p>In total in R05, we processed 3,618 files from 1,496 providers. We also had over 3750 files which were uploaded for validation only</p>

<p>Lots of providers are leaving their submissions until the last minute. This is a risky approach as you must have a submission with us by the deadline to guarantee your payments.</p>

<p>Over 555 providers submitted their first R05 file within the final 3 days of the R05 collection window, 179 of these submitted their first R05 file on the final day.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Return period 5 graph showing data submissions for the period" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/95517/R05_submission_graph_960_by_640.png"></div></figure>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>For action: Individualised Learner Record (ILR): R06 for 2019 to 2020</h2>

<p>The ILR R06 data collection for 2019 to 2020 is open and will close at 6pm on Thursday 6th February.</p>

<p>As always, we recommend that you submit your data as early as possible and that you review your validation and funding reports that are made available to you on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" rel="external">Submit learner data</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>For information: ILR specification for 2020 to 2021 Public Beta</h2>

<p>For 2020 to 2021 we are introducing our new online ILR product which can be accessed from the following location:</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://guidance.submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">https://guidance.submitlearnerdatabeta.fasst.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>This new site will contain all ILR related material going forward and link back to previous years publications. The ILR specification is the first document to be implemented as online content, all other ILR material where applicable will gradually follow suit throughout the year.</p>

<p>We will be publishing an ‘Introduction to the new ILR’ on the above link in due course which will cover the offline functionality and further information on how to use the site to its fullest potential.</p>

<p>The ILR summary of changes will give a complete detailed view of the changes implemented for 2020 to 2021. A brief overview of the changes is below:</p>

<p>The ILR specification states that there should be one learner record for each learner, this has now been changed there must be one learner record for each learner. This will be enforced in validation for 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>A new field has been added to collect Actual Hours for Off the Job Training at the end of the programme.</p>

<p>Two new programme types have been added to identify T-Level and T-Level transition programmes. T-Level planned hours will also be collected in the existing Planned Hours field.</p>

<p>The number of Devolved Area Monitoring codes has been increased from 4 to 6.</p>

<p>The Agreement Identifier field has been removed.</p>

<p>A number of redundant Funding and monitoring types and codes have been removed (details in the ILR summary of changes).</p>

<p>Please use the feedback link on the site to help us improve the functionality. On the introduction page, we will be posting our functionality backlog and will edit it as we progress through it.</p>
