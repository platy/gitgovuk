  <p class="last-child">Communities across Wirral, most recently Greasby and Wallasey, have suffered from the effects of these illegal camps. It’s right that the law is changed and that the police, and local councils, are given the powers to end these sites from springing up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Councillor David Burgess</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>Unauthorised encampments can create significant challenges for local authorities and cause distress and misery to those who live nearby.</p>

<p>They also often give an unfair, negative image of the vast majority of travellers who abide by the law.</p>

<p>As we pledged in our Manifesto, we will   create a criminal offence of residing in a vehicle on land without permission. The new offence has been framed in such a way as to ensure that the rights of ramblers and others to enjoy the countryside are not impacted. In addition, we will give the police the power to seize vehicles, and we will strengthen existing powers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>The Government is legislating to create a new offence for England and Wales and an      accompanying power for the police to seize property (including vehicles) where individuals reside or intend to reside on land with a vehicle. The offence will be committed if a person who resides or intends to reside with a vehicle on land fails to leave the land or remove their property without reasonable excuse when asked to do so by the occupier of the land, their representative or a constable and they have caused, or are likely to cause, significant    damage, disruption, or distress (including anti-social behaviour).</p>

<p>A person guilty of this offence will be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale (currently £2,500), or both.</p>

<p>The Bill also amends the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”) to broaden the list of harms that can be subject to the direction to leave under section 61(1)(a) (these replicate the damage, disruption and distress included in the new offence but will not be “significant”) and increase the period in which persons directed away from land must not return from three months to 12 months. Amendments to the 1994 Act will, in addition, allow police to direct trespassers away from roads.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<p>The Home Office launched a public consultation in November 2019 to seek views on how we should strengthen police powers. We looked at how we could criminalise the act of   trespass when setting up or residing on an unauthorised encampment and how we could amend the 1994 Act.</p>

<p>This followed a consultation in 2018 which was held in response to long standing concerns about the impact of unauthorised encampments and developments. This consultation sought views on the effectiveness of enforcement against unauthorised  developments and encampments and was led by MHCLG in partnership with the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Current police powers:</h3>

<p>Section 61-62 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides the police with two powers to remove unauthorised encampments where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The unauthorised campers have caused damage to the land or property on the land (except highways).</li>
  <li>They have used threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to the occupier, 	a member of the occupiers’ family, or their employee or agent.</li>
  <li>There are six or more vehicles on the land.</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 62A of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allows the police to direct trespassers to remove themselves and their vehicles and property from land where a     suitable pitch on a relevant caravan site is available within the same local authority area (or within the county in two-tier local authority areas). These powers can be used on any land.
The decision to remove&nbsp;travellers from a site is an independent decision to be made by  police and&nbsp;local authorities. Each case is dealt with on its own merits with full               consideration given to their responsibilities under their Public Sector Equality Duty and the potential impact enforcement may have on those involved. This approach will apply to the new offence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Current local authority powers:</h3>

<p>Local authorities determine when it is appropriate to use their powers to evict                unauthorised encampments under sections 77 and 78 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 .</p>

<p>66% of people who responded on behalf of local authorities to the 2019 consultation were in favour of a new criminal offence for intentional trespass. 94% supported one or more of the proposed amendments to the 1994 Act to extend the powers the police have to direct          trespassers to leave land.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Why have you decided to create a new criminal offence and amend the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 simultaneously?</h3>

<p>The Government’s view is that criminalisation of intentional residence on land without consent and the extension of existing powers in the 1994 Act will provide police with  sufficient powers to effectively and efficiently enforce against a range of harms caused by some unauthorised encampments. The offence and strengthened police powers could also deter unauthorised encampments from being set up in the first instance.</p>

<p>The 2018 consultation aimed to understand the appetite to extend powers available to the police when dealing with unauthorised encampments. The 2019 consultation asked how we should extend those powers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Is this going to affect people using the countryside?</h3>

<p>No, nothing changes for ramblers or those wishing to enjoy the countryside. The offence only affects  those residing on, or intending to reside on, land with a vehicle, who cause or are likely to cause significant damage, disruption or distress and who do not leave the land or remove their property without reasonable excuse when asked to do so by the occupier of the land, their representative or a constable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>The answer is adequate site provision—not enforcement. What are you dong there?</h3>

<p>The Government is still committed to delivering a cross-government strategy to tackle the inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities.</p>

<p>There is wider Government support for the provision of traveller sites via the New Homes Bonus which provides an incentive for local authorities to encourage housing growth in their areas, and rewards net increases in effective housing stock, including the provision of authorised traveller pitches.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>How is this workable without a site to move people onto?</h2>

<p>In the January 2020 Traveller Caravan Count there were 356 transit pitches provided by Local Authorities and Private Registered Providers in England and Wales. This was an increase of 41% from the January 2010 Traveller Caravan Count.</p>
