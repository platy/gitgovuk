<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">New search and arrest powers are needed to close a small but significant gap in public protection when dealing with released offenders who present a terrorist risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jonathan Hall QC, Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The management of persons in the community convicted of terrorism is a significant responsibility for police and probation services to keep the public safe. The new powers available to policing will help to enhance our support to this partnership responsibility in future, giving us the ability to respond quickly to dynamically changing information, ensure compliance with conditions of sentencing and licences, and ultimately better protect the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tim Jacques, Deputy Senior National Co-ordinator of Counter-Terrorism Policing</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We will give the police three new powers to manage the risk posed by terrorist offenders and terrorist risk offenders.</p>

<p>We will also make a number of changes to Multi-Agency Public Protection                 Arrangements (MAPPA) in order to improve the management and supervision of terrorist and terrorist risk offenders.</p>

<p>These changes were recommended by  Jonathan Hall QC in his independent <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/913983/supervision-terrorism-and-terrorism-risk-offenders-review.pdf" rel="external">review</a> into MAPPA, conducted following the attack at Fishmongers’ Hall in November 2019. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2020-12-17/hcws686" rel="external">Government response is available here</a>.</p>

<p>We will work closely with the police and probation services to ensure that the public is protected from the most dangerous offenders, while encouraging the rehabilitation of others into society.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Police powers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides for the following additional powers for the police to better manage the risk posed by terrorist offenders:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Premises search: The police will be able to apply to a court for a warrant to search the premises of any offender released on licence to assess their terrorism risk. This will include checking whether the offender is complying with the conditions of their licence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Personal search: The police will be able to carry out a personal search on a terrorist offender when this is required by their licence conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Urgent arrest: The police will be able to arrest a terrorist offender who is likely to be recalled to custody due to a breach of their licence conditions. It will not require a warrant and will apply in specific circumstances pending recall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>MAPPA</h3>

<p>MAPPA is the set of arrangements through which the police, probation and prison services work together with other agencies to manage the risks posed by violent, sexual, and terrorist offenders living in the community in order to protect the public.</p>

<p>Measures in the Bill will also ensure that terrorist and terrorist connected offenders will be     automatically managed under MAPPA. Although the vast majority already are, the changes made by the Bill will ensure no cases slip through the net by mandating that terrorist and       terrorist  connected offenders must  automatically fall under MAPPA.</p>

<p>The Bill will also ensure that offenders who pose a terrorist risk are MAPPA eligible. It will     provide a clear discretionary route for those assessed as posing a terrorist risk, so that they may be MAPPA managed, regardless of their original offence.</p>

<p>Duty to Co-operate Agencies (DTC) are specified agencies such as Youth Offending Teams, Local Housing Authorities and Local Education Authorities who are required to work with     prisons, probation and the police to assess and manage the risks posed by MAPPA offenders. The Bill puts beyond doubt the powers of DTC agencies to share information under MAPPA by clarifying existing information sharing provisions. In addition, the Bill expressly provides that those agencies or individuals who are not DTC may share information under MAPPA if they are contributing to the management of an offender’s risk, for example GPs.  Although the powers already exist, some agencies and individuals have expressed uncertainty as they emanate from a range of legislation; the Bill will clarify the position.</p>

<p>The Bill also puts beyond doubt that sharing information under MAPPA is for the law             enforcement functions under Part 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018. This will give greater    confidence to DTC agencies when sharing information, supporting more effective risk         management.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<p>How MAPPA works now:</p>

<p>The Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for the establishment of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements in each of the 42 criminal justice areas in England and Wales.</p>

<p>MAPPA allows agencies to assess and manage the level of risk of harm offenders pose to the public on a multi-agency basis and by working together, sharing information and meeting to ensure that effective plans are put in place. Some measures that can be considered are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allowing offenders to live only at a previously agreed address, which can include requiring the offender to reside at a probation run Approved Premises on release.</li>
  <li>Placing controls on the offender’s behaviour through strict licence conditions which can include not to have contact with a named individual or not to enter a defined    exclusion zone.</li>
  <li>Intensive supervision by a probation officer offender manager and/or monitoring by public protection police</li>
  <li>Ensuring the offender attends identified accredited programmes and other               interventions (such as drug and alcohol programmes) aimed at reducing further offending.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Why are these measures needed?</h2>

<p>The measures in the Bill are improvements to current legislation identified by Jonathan Hall QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation.</p>

<p>Premises search: This will address the concern that there are currently insufficient search powers available to the police to assess the terrorism risk posed by offenders who are of      terrorism concern and the extent to which check they are complying with their licence          conditions. This new power will improve the ability of operational partners to manage risk.</p>

<p>Personal search: This will assess an offender’s possible involvement in terrorism related     activity and will protect public safety. For example, it will provide a deterrent for offenders on licence to take weapons with them when travelling and will ensure that offender managers need not be exposed to danger during meetings with high risk offenders.</p>

<p>Urgent arrest: This is required in specific circumstances where arrest is not possible under current legislation. This includes arrest of an offender who refuses to go to their Approved Premises after release or who refuses to comply with the personal search and premises search powers.</p>

<p>MAPPA eligibility: This will address the concern that MAPPA eligibility for terrorist offenders is currently overcomplicated and will ensure that all terrorist offenders, regardless of sentence length or the type   of offence, will be covered by multi-agency management on release. It will also ensure other offenders who are identified as posing a terrorist risk can be managed under MAPPA.</p>

<p>Information sharing: This will address the lack of confidence in, and the complexity of, current measures. It will do so by putting beyond doubt the right for DTC  agencies to share information under MAPPA and confirm that doing so is pursuant to Part 3 of the  Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Which offenders will the police powers apply to?</h2>

<p>The new powers provided for in the Bill are expected to be used sparingly, since a limited     cohort of high-risk offenders within  specific scenarios are in scope. They nevertheless offer substantial improvements to public protection.</p>

<p>Premises search: This will apply to any offender who is assessed to pose a terrorism risk while they remain on licence. This assessment will be made following cross agency agreement and must satisfy a magistrate before a warrant is issued.</p>

<p>Personal search: This will apply to terrorist and terrorist-connected offenders with a licence condition requiring them to comply with it. This condition will be restricted to offenders who pose a high risk of serious harm and will be applied when considered necessary and            proportionate for a given individual.</p>

<p>Urgent arrest: This will apply to terrorist and terrorist connected offenders. It is expected to be used in rare situations where an offender is not committing an offence but is in breach of their licence conditions and is thought to pose a terrorism risk before they can be recalled. Care will be taken to ensure that police only make an arrest once probation is satisfied that they will  recall the offender.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>How will an individual’s right to privacy be maintained?</h2>

<p>Information sharing amongst MAPPA agencies is governed by statute and statutory guidance. Each MAPPA Strategic Management Board is required to have an information sharing     agreement in line with the Information Commissioner’s Code of Practice. Any information    sharing must be in accordance with the legal framework and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Key facts</h2>

<p>In the year ending September 2020, there were 49 convictions for terrorism-related offences in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In the year ending June 2020, there were 42 terrorist offenders released from prison custody in Great Britain.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span>What is the Government doing to manage   terrorist offenders in prison and on             probation?</h3>

<p>In 2017 a new joint Her Majesty’s Prison and   Probation Service and Home Office Extremism Unit was created to be the strategic centre for all counter terrorism work in prison and probation; we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bolstered and improved a network of counter-terrorism (CT) specialist prison and probation staff across England and Wales;</li>
  <li>Overseen the national roll out of the revised offender case management process;</li>
  <li>Created a new CT specialist cadre of prison Imams;</li>
  <li>Introduced separation centres (there are currently three centres available, one in     operation) to hold the most subversive extremist prisoners, preventing them from spreading their malicious ideology;</li>
  <li>Embedded the prison strand Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) in the sector; and</li>
  <li>Rolled out a training programme to help  prison staff identify, report and deal with   extremist’s behaviour in prison. Over 29,000 prison staff have been trained.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span>Could the attacks in Fishmongers’ Hall and Streatham have been averted had these changes to the MAPPA process been in place?</h3>

<p>Jonathan Hall found that MAPPA is a well established process and did not conclude that wholesale change is necessary.</p>

<p>He made a number of recommendations on how the management of terrorists can be improved,  but it would be wrong to see those as a judgment on what happened in the run up to those attacks as his review did not consider the circumstances that led up to these attacks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span>Are the police powers compliant with human rights commitments?</h3>

<p>The Government considers that it is justified to enact these powers given the severity of the  potential threat to public safety.</p>

<p>The power of personal search will be made without suspicion but this is mitigated by the fact that it is limited to a class of offenders who have been assessed as posing a particular risk to the public.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span>Are the police powers sufficient?</h3>

<p>The Government, police and HM Prison and Probation Service are working closely to examine recommendations from the MAPPA Review and identify any further changes which might help better protect the public.</p>

<p>The Government believes that the current regime strikes the right balance. These measures are considered proportionate to the benefits they provide in managing risk, given the likelihood of serious harm should an offender re engage in terrorism related activity. </p>
