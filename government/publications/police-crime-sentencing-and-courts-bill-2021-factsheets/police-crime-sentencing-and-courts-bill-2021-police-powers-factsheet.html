<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">We are giving the police the powers they need to get justice for missing family members, match offenders to crimes and obtain swifter access to overseas electronic data for evidential purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Victoria Atkins, Minister for  Safeguarding</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We are going to ensure the police have the necessary powers in place to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make it easier for police forces to recall people to take fingerprints, DNA samples and photographs, where this was not done on initial arrest.</li>
  <li>Enable the swifter receipt of electronic data, crucial to criminal investigations and prosecutions by making some practical changes in the operating process of the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019 and the Overseas Production Orders mechanism.</li>
  <li>Access information relating to the location of human remains outside of criminal proceedings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>The Bill amends the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) to allow the police to stipulate a specific date and time to require people to attend the relevant police station for taking of fingerprints, DNA samples and photographs.</p>

<p>The Bill amends the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To allow law enforcement officers and prosecutors to obtain, through an Overseas Production Order, the necessary associated or connected communications data (for example information on who an email was sent to and from, when it was sent) together with the content data (such as pictures and text content of emails). In practice, this will streamline the process and enable swifter turnaround in obtaining vital evidence from service providers, located outside the UK, to support domestic investigations and prosecutions.</li>
  <li>To allow the service of an Overseas Production Order under section 9 of the Act to be delegated to an appropriate body. This will provide this process with necessary agility including future proofing to meet the demands of any future international agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bill will also allow officers to obtain a search warrant or production order from a court in relation to the location of a person’s remains without the need to link this to an           indictable offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Attendance at a police station for taking of fingerprints, non-intimate samples and photographs</h3>

<p>People who are arrested and taken to a custody suite can have fingerprints, DNA samples and a photograph taken straight away. If this is not done, there is a recall power to require those who have been arrested, charged or convicted to attend a police station so that their             fingerprints and DNA sample can be taken.</p>

<p>Currently, the person can be required to attend a police station at a particular time but not a particular day, only any day within a seven-day period. Forces find this makes the power       difficult to use, as they cannot deploy an officer or staff member to take the biometrics at a  specific time. Also, the recall power does not cover photographs.</p>

<p>In practice, this results in opportunities to take fingerprints, DNA or photographs being missed. This means that matches to crimes the person may have committed in the past or may commit in the future are not made.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Amendments to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) - COPO - Act 2019</h3>

<p>Increasingly, terrorists and criminals are using global communications services to facilitate their criminal activities. Data generated by those applications is a vital source of evidence for the prosecution of criminal offences, including terrorism and child sexual exploitation. Law enforcement agencies and prosecution authorities need to obtain the evidence they require for their investigations and prosecutions effectively and swiftly. Most of this relevant electronic data is held or controlled by service providers based outside the UK.</p>

<p>Current UK legislation which allows law enforcement agencies and prosecuting authorities to access stored electronic data is not explicitly extra territorial and so only effective when the company holding or controlling the information is located in the UK. To obtain this type of data from service providers based outside the UK Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) channels are used. MLA is a form of judicial cooperation between State authorities that allows law             enforcement officers and prosecutors to obtain data for evidence purposes from the other’s  jurisdiction. However, the MLA process often takes a long time. It may result in delayed or abandoned investigations or prosecutions or may delay people from being eliminated from a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>The COPO Act 2019 enables law enforcement officers and prosecutors to access and obtain stored electronic content data direct from persons (broadly service providers), located or       operating outside the UK, to support criminal  investigations and prosecutions. An application for an overseas production order is made to a UK court by an appropriate officer, as defined in the COPO Act. A judge approves an overseas production order, subject to the required        conditions and tests set out in the COPO Act, being met. If approved, the order is served on the relevant service provider.</p>

<p>Overseas production orders can only be used to request electronic data from service providers located in a country where a relevant designated international cooperation arrangement is in place. The first of these agreements expected to enter into force is the UK US Data Access Agreement.</p>

<p>During the implementation process some practical issues were highlighted that require      amendments to the COPO Act. These will ensure a more streamlined and more effective      operational process under the COPO Act to allow law enforcement officers and prosecutors to receive vital evidence from service providers located outside the UK.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Obtaining information about the location of human remains where the suspect is deceased</h3>
<p>Section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) gives police powers to enter and search specified premises, and seize evidence, subject to application to a judge for a   warrant.</p>

<p>In order for a warrant to be granted, the judge must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an indictable offence has been committed, and that there is material on the premises that is likely to be both relevant and of substantial value to the investigation of that offence. They must be also satisfied that it is not practicable to communicate with individuals able to grant entry to the premises/evidence, that entry will not be granted without a warrant or that the purpose of the search might be frustrated or prejudiced without immediate entry to the premises.</p>

<p>The case of Keith Bennett identified a gap in the existing search warrant legislation. 12 year old Keith Bennett was abducted and killed by ‘Moors Murderers’ Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s. His family have been looking for his body for over fifty years.</p>

<p>Ian Brady died in prison in 2017 and left two locked briefcases in the possession of his solicitor. He had previously suggested to the Bennett family that he held information relating to the location of Keith’s body, but the existence of the briefcases was not known until after his death.</p>

<p>A magistrate subsequently denied an application by Greater Manchester Police for search  warrants to access the briefcases to see if they contained information, on the grounds that as both Brady and Hindley were deceased it was no longer possible to bring about any             prosecution for criminal offences relating to Keith’s death.</p>

<p>The issue was raised with the Home Office in 2019. On investigation, it was concluded that there were no further avenues available to Greater Manchester Police and the Home Office made the decision to resolve the issue through a change in the law.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Further Key Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This reform makes it easier for the police to take fingerprints, DNA samples and photographs from  people who have been arrested, charged, or convicted. It applies where these biometrics were not initially taken at the time of arrest and means the police can recall people to attend a police station for this to be done. These biometrics are key tools for the police in combatting crime and reducing harm in our  communities through identifying and bringing offenders to    justice. These powers will increase the opportunities to match offenders to crimes they may have committed in the past or may commit in the  future, and are welcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assistant Chief Constable Ben Snuggs, NPCC Chair of the Forensic Information Database Strategy Board</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The Crime Overseas Production Order Act will allow policing to interrogate the digital material that serious and organised criminals generate as a result of their&nbsp;offending at a pace that has not been possible previously. Every investigation is a search for the truth and the Act will allow investigators to establish the facts more effectively and support them in proving or disproving a suspect’s involvement. It is likely to result in more effective prosecutions of those who cause the greatest harm to communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve Worron, NPCC Serious Organised Crime Portfolio, Sensitive Equities Lead</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Search warrants are a vital tool for the police to investigate criminal offences.&nbsp; This new power will allow the police to apply for a warrant and gain access to material that could reveal the location of the body of a murder victim, notwithstanding that the offender themselves may be deceased.&nbsp; Importantly, this could help ease the heartache and suffering of murder victims’ families in circumstances where otherwise their loved ones might not be found.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Attendance at a police station for taking of fingerprints, non intimate samples and      photographs</h3>

<h4>Why do we need this change now?</h4>

<p>More people are now interviewed voluntarily and then arrested, charged or convicted later without having gone through a custody suite, so the ‘recall’ power has become more important.</p>

<h4>Does this change mean that police powers to retain fingerprints and DNA are being widened?</h4>

<p>No.  As now, fingerprints and DNA profiles taken from people who are arrested or charged can be retained while an investigation is ongoing, but they can only be retained indefinitely if the person is convicted, and retention must be subject to periodic    review.</p>

<h4>Does this measure affect retention of photographs?</h4>

<p>No. As now, people who are not convicted will have the right to request deletion of their  photographs, and there is a strong  presumption that this request will be agreed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Amendments to the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) - COPO - Act 2019</h3>

<h4>Why do we need these amendments?</h4>

<p>During the implementation process, some practical issues were highlighted that require amendments to the COPO Act 2019. These practical changes to the operating process provided for by the Act and to the Overseas Production Orders mechanism will enable law enforcement officers and prosecutors to receive electronic data crucial to their criminal investigations and  prosecutions more swiftly, from service providers located outside the UK.</p>

<h4>What do the amendments intend to do?</h4>

<p>Currently all communications data sought from a telecommunications operator (a type of service provider) is excluded from the scope of the COPO Act 2019 – so as to not interfere with the current regime provided by the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. However, this means that          communications data (information on who an email was sent to and from, and when an email was sent) associated or  connected to the content data sought cannot be sought using an Overseas  Production Order. Content data will be limited in evidential value if the associated    communications data is not provided e.g. to understand who sent a message, to whom and when. An amendment is required to allow an Overseas Production Order to be sought to obtain both the  content of a communication and any   connected or associated communications data. The ability to seek communications data for any other purpose is still not permitted by Act and is subject to the process set out in the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.</p>

<p>An amendment is also required to allow an appropriate body to be delegated for the service of Overseas Production Orders. This is necessary to ensure operational agility and future proofing,  including for any future international agreements that might be agreed, especially for example when there might be a need to use secure systems to transmit requests and receive data.</p>

<h4>Does the proposed amendment to enable Law Enforcement Officers and Prosecutors to obtain associated or connected communications data mean they will be receiving even more information?</h4>

<p>No. Under the current Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) mechanism used by law enforcement officers and prosecutors electronic content data, associated and connected communications data is provided.</p>

<p>Until such time as the COPO Act 2019 is  amended law enforcement officers and          prosecutors (when in operational use in 2021) will need to make a dual application; one for the content data under the COPO Act 2019 and a further application for the associated or connected communications data under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. 
This amendment will streamline the process for law enforcement officers and prosecutors         improving their ability to obtain or access the required electronic data through an Overseas  Production Order to support criminal  investigations and prosecutions more swiftly. This is in line with the domestic regime under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, on which the COPO Act was based.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Obtaining information about the location of human remains where the suspect is deceased</h3>

<h4>Why did the law not allow the police to do this anyway?</h4>

<p>Search warrants, issued under PACE, are  intended for criminal investigations and            designed to help bring criminals to justice. The reason that the law does not allow the police to have a search warrant in these circumstances is because it is not possible to charge anyone with a criminal offense, for example because they are deceased or have already been prosecuted for the offence.</p>

<p>The police need this additional  power to bridge the gap and help families get the closure they  deserve. By changing the law, we can make sure the police have the powers they need to help  families in these terrible situations.</p>

<h4>How will this work in practice/ when will these powers be used?</h4>

<p>Police will only be able to apply for a search warrant under these difficult and delicate   circumstances.</p>

<p>A judge will issue a search warrant if they are content that the police have no other          alternative and there is no other way a person’s remains can be found.   &nbsp;</p>

<p>This power is only intended to be used as a last resort, but it is there to make sure that the Government has done everything in its power to reunite families with the remains of their loved ones.</p>

<h4>Search warrants are intrusive powers – how can you ensure this won’t be overused? How will its use be monitored?&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Use of the power is subject to the approval of a judge and similar safeguards to existing search warrant powers.</p>

<p>This power is only intended to be used as a last resort, but it is there to make sure that the Government has done everything in its power to reunite families with the remains of their loved ones.</p>

<p>The Home Office will work with the police to monitor the use of the new power.</p>

<h4>Does this mean innocent people can have their houses searched for crimes that have nothing to do with them?</h4>

<p>Officers will always work with members of the public to find the best solution if they believe they need access to a property in relation to an investigation.</p>

<p>This measure will allow the police to seek a warrant for entry in the unlikely circumstance it is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
