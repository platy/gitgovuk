<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Rather than continuing to send [offenders] back and forth to prison - doing the same thing but expecting a different result - we instead want to empower the sentencing system to use more effective community&nbsp;sentencing to get them off drugs and into the jobs that we know can lead them to a better life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rt Hon Robert Buckland QC MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We plan to pilot a problem-solving court approach for certain community and suspended sentence orders.</p>

<p>We will simplify the national adult Out of Court Disposals framework.</p>

<p>We will improve employment opportunities by reducing rehabilitation periods for offenders, helping them to move on with their lives.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>The Bill creates provisions that allow the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Problem-Solving Courts (PSC), with a judge leading a multidisciplinary rehab team. Additional powers are required to:
    <ul>
      <li>enable judges to initiate breach proceedings at regular review hearings—allowing judges to manage the order directly and shorten the timescales for offenders to return to court etc</li>
      <li>expand drug testing beyond Drug Rehabilitation Requirements enables the PSC to incorporate offenders whose drug misuse drives their offending behaviour but who may not be drug dependent</li>
      <li>introduce a power to order a short custodial penalty where offenders breach an order, without requiring the judge to terminate the order or remove requirements - offenders will have the opportunity to continue with their rehabilitation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduces a two-tier framework for Out of Court Disposals (OOCDs) and replaces the six common adult OOCDs, including Simple Cautions, Cannabis / Khat Warnings and Penalty Notices for Disorder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There will be a lower-tier disposal (community caution) and an upper-tier disposal (diversionary caution). There must be conditions attached to both aimed at one of three objectives, namely rehabilitation, reparation or punishment. Restrictive conditions can be set where they contribute to reparation or rehabilitation. Victims should be consulted for their views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introducing a rehabilitation period for some sentences of over 4 years, meaning that for non-sensitive jobs or activities they do not have to be disclosed to employers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Reducing the time that community orders and sentences under 4 years have to be revealed to most employers. These reductions in disclosure periods will also improve access to employment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Problem-Solving Courts (PSCs)</h3>

<p>PSCs are an active and dynamic path to justice providing robust rehabilitation and support to offenders who can be both prolific and vulnerable. It places judges and magistrates at the centre of sentencing, rehabilitation and compliance, alongside a multi-disciplinary team ranging from probation and health professionals, to police and broader service providers.</p>

<p>The overarching principle is that there will be consistent judicial oversight, reviews, rewards with incentives and sanctions that focus on supporting offenders to address the problems that drive their offending behaviour.</p>

<p>PSCs provide a regime that offers more intensive or structured support for offenders sentenced to a community order or suspended sentence order with community requirements. The onus will be on the individual to actively engage in the positive elements of their sentence, combined with more reliable access to the other services they may need such as substance misuse and mental health service providers.</p>

<p>The model differs from existing community orders, as they will be responsive to an offender’s “criminogenic needs”, that is the things that drive their offending, like drug misuse, and allows relatively rapid changes to the balance of incentives and sanctions to be made directly by the reviewing judge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Out of Court Disposals</h3>

<p>The intention of out of court disposals has been to minimise the risk of people being drawn into the criminal justice system when there is no public interest to prosecute and their behaviour is better addressed in the long term by a less formal intervention, as necessary, with the involvement of the victim.</p>

<p>The proposed measures allow greater powers to divert offenders to support pathways, such as engagement with mental health or substance abuse services. This new power provides an opportunity for early intervention to address the underlying issues that contribute to offending behaviour.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Criminal Record Reform - Reducing Rehabilitation Periods</h3>

<p>The system of criminal records disclosure provides protections to people with convictions who desist from crime and means that, after a certain period of time, most convictions will become “spent”. When asked, those persons do not need to disclose their convictions to potential employers for most roles unless an exception applies. The exceptions balance public protection by requiring more serious and some spent convictions be disclosed when working in a sensitive position or with sensitive groups.</p>

<p>Employment is a significant factor in encouraging rehabilitation, and it is in everyone’s interest that we successfully rehabilitate offenders. We recognise that having a criminal record can have a significant impact on children or adults who offended as a child.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> What are the main advantages of Problem-Solving Courts?</h3>

<p>Tailored, effective rehabilitative sentences - the court will identify potential candidates for the problem-solving approach and through robust pre-sentence reports, the options best suited to manage the offender’s criminogenic needs will be identified.</p>

<p>Consistent judicial monitoring - ensuring offenders have the consistency of the same sentencer from start to finish enables their progress to be managed in a closer and more robust way.</p>

<p>Rewards and sanctions - as well as rewarding good compliance, the judge will punish non-compliance by swiftly ‘stepping up and down’ requirements or removing them altogether.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Why do we need a criminal record reform?</h3>

<p>The criminal records disclosure system aims to strike a balance between protecting individuals and businesses and recognising that offenders who have desisted from crime should be able to move on and fully participate in society.</p>

<p>Employment is a significant factor in encouraging rehabilitation, and it is in everyone’s interest that we successfully rehabilitate offenders.</p>

<p>We therefore seek to remove barriers to employment, and this means that after a certain period of time most convictions will become spent and no longer need to be disclosed.</p>

<p>Reforming the regime to ensure that criminal records are disclosed only where potentially relevant to the role should improve ex-offender employment, supporting public protection by reducing reoffending.</p>

<p>In finding the right balance, the system will always seek to prevent harm and protect vulnerable individuals</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Why change the OOCD framework?</h3>

<p>The two-tier framework improves national consistency among police forces to address low-level offending with a greater opportunity to access support pathways.</p>

<p>A review of OOCD’s ran from 2013 to 2014. This sought views from the public, as well as practitioners within the criminal justice system and confirmed that OOCD’s needed reform.</p>

<p>In 2014/2015 there was a pilot of the new framework in three police forces. The evaluation of the pilot highlighted generally positive responses from police and victims welcomed the opportunity for engagement.</p>

<p>The Bill aims to decrease the escalation in offending. The changes will provide practitioners, the public and offenders to whom they are given with more clarity in OOCDs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Key Facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Greater Manchester, which runs a PSC approach for women has a lower annual average reoffending rate for female offenders compared to similar urban areas, and England and Wales overall (15% compared to 23% for the April 2017 to March 2018 cohort (proven reoffending statistics: January to March 2018).</li>
  <li>The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) supported the move to a two-tier structure and published a strategy at the end of 2017 encouraging the move.</li>
  <li>50% of employers would not consider hiring an ex-offender, but obtaining employment within 12 months release from prison could reduce reoffending by 5-10 percent.</li>
  <li>80% of those who were convicted or cautioned had already received at least one previous conviction or caution.</li>
  <li>The estimated economic and social cost of reoffending by adults was £16.7 billion.</li>
</ul>
