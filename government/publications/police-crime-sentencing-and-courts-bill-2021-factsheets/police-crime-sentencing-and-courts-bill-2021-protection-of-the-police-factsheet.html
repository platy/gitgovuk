<blockquote>
  <p>This Covenant will mean much more than words to serving or former police officers. It recognises the unique position they hold in society and the fact they very often put their lives on the line.</p>

  <p class="last-child">Being assaulted – whether you are a police officer, firefighter, prison officer or paramedic – is completely unacceptable. The sentences should always be a     deterrent and reflect the seriousness they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>John Apter, National Chair, Police Federation of England and Wales</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We are going to ensure that the police have access to support, protection and recognition they deserve by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introducing and enshrining in law a duty to prepare an annual Police Covenant Report with regard to the principle that members or former members of the police workforce should not be disadvantaged as a result of working in policing;</li>
  <li>Doubling the maximum penalty for common  assault or battery committed against an emergency worker from 12 months to two years’ imprisonment, ensuring that emergency workers have sufficient protection from the law to enable them to carry out their duties and the   maximum penalty reflects the severity of the offence.</li>
  <li>Introducing a new test to assess the standard of driving of a police officer, to allow the courts to judge their standard of driving against a competent and careful police constable with the same level of training.</li>
  <li>Ensure special constables have access to the same  support and representation as regular constables through enabling them to join the Police Federation of England and Wales.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Police Covenant</h3>

<p>This Bill introduces a duty on the Home Secretary to prepare and lay before Parliament an annual Police Covenant Report. Enshrining the Police Covenant Report in law will ensure accountability and action.</p>

<p>Integral to this will be a strong and robust non statutory governance structure. A Police Covenant Oversight Board will be established, chaired by the Minister for Crime and Policing and including key policing representatives. The Board will develop a defined programme of activity and the work of this group will help to inform the Home Secretary’s annual report to Parliament.</p>

<p>The Police Covenant itself will take the form of a declaration and will not be set out in legislation. Initial priorities for the Covenant, identified through the consultation will be: health and wellbeing, physical protection and support for families and each of these key issues will be addressed in the Police Covenant Report. The Covenant is expected to be an evolving concept that will change over time as we identify new and emerging issues and priorities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Assaults on Emergency Workers</h3>

<p>The Bill amends the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 to double the maximum penalty for common assault or battery committed against an emergency worker who is acting in the exercise of their functions. This will increase the maximum penalty from 12 months to two years’ imprisonment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Special Constables</h3>

<p>The Bill amends the Police Act 1996 to allow the Police Federation to represent special       constables appointed to police areas in England and Wales, in the same circumstances as it represents members of police forces.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Police Driving Standards</h3>

<p>Provisions in the Bill will introduce a new legal test that will compare a police driver to a peer with a similar level of training rather than a standard motorist.&nbsp;Currently a police officer’s driving is judged against that of a standard qualified driver and no account can be taken of a police driver’s skill or training when deciding whether their driving was careless or dangerous. 
&nbsp;
The Home Office, working closely with the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the  College of Policing, will monitor the introduction of standardised police driver training which will support this measure. The work will ensure that police driver training is consistently high across England and Wales so that the assessment of a ‘trained police driver’ as part of the legal test can be fairly applied (separate national standards will apply in Scotland). A certification process will be introduced by the NPCC and College of Policing to evaluate police driver training.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Police Covenant</h3>

<p>In July 2019 the Government announced plans to introduce a Police Covenant, in recognition of the bravery and commitment of the police. The Home Secretary then announced at the Police Superintendents’ Conference in September 2019 that she would launch a public consultation on the Covenant, focusing on health and wellbeing, physical protection and support for families.  In December 2019, the Government manifesto committed to enshrining the Covenant in law.<br>
&nbsp;
The public consultation ran between February and April 2020, and the response, which showed overwhelming support for the Covenant, was published in September 2020.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Assaults on Emergency Workers</h3>

<p>The Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 increased, from six to 12 months’ imprisonment, the maximum penalty for common assault or battery committed against an  emergency worker who is acting in the exercise of their functions. The Act covers police      constables; National Crime Agency officers; prison and custody officers; fire, rescue and search personnel; and those providing NHS healthcare services who have face to face         interaction with patients or other members of the public. The Government was elected with a  manifesto commitment  to consult on a further doubling of the maximum penalty for assaulting an emergency worker to two years.  A targeted consultation was launched on 13 July 2020  directed at representative groups for emergency workers and other key stakeholders. The large majority of those who responded were in favour of doubling the maximum penalty to two years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Following consultation, on 15 September 2020, the Government announced that it would bring    forward legislation to increase the maximum penalty for assaulting an emergency worker from 12 months to two years’ imprisonment. This will ensure that the law provides emergency   workers with sufficient protection to enable them to carry out their duties, and a maximum   penalty which reflects the severity of these offences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Police Driving Standards</h3>

<p>The tests set out in the Road Traffic Act 1988 for the offences of careless and dangerous    driving apply to police drivers in the same way as any other driver, taking no account of the various exemptions to road traffic legislation (for example, in relation to speed limits and road signs) that apply to the police or of their additional training. Those offences are committed when a person drives in a way that is below (careless) or far below (dangerous) what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, that is a member of the public.</p>

<p>The police need to be able to do their job effectively and keep the public safe, without fear of prosecution for simply doing their job.&nbsp;The Government is aware of the concern among some police officers&nbsp;over the legal position when pursuing suspected offenders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Government’s response to the consultation into the “The Law, Guidance and Training Governing Police Pursuits”, published in May 2019, showed widespread support for the    measure. Almost three quarters of responses (71%) disagreed with the current approach, that a police officer should be held to the driving standard of a ‘careful and competent’ motorist.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Special Constable representation by the Police Federation of England and Wales</h3>

<p>The Police Act 1996 sets out the purpose of the Police Federation of England and Wales as to represent “members of the police forces” in England and Wales. As special constables are not in legislative terms “members” of a police force, they are not eligible to join the Police           Federation.</p>

<p>Special constables play a vital role in their community as volunteer police officers. They have the same powers as a regular officer and provide unique skills, experiences and expertise.   Increasingly, special constables are fulfilling specialised roles within police forces and as a   result they may face similar risks on duty to those of regular officers.</p>

<p>Currently, the special constabulary can access free legal assistance, funded by the Home 
Office. This legal assistance covers disciplinary and misconduct proceedings, but it does not provide end to end support and advice, for example, in the immediate aftermath of an incident.<br>
The policy intention is to ensure special constables have access to the same support and    representation as regular constables through having the option to join the Police Federation. 
The Government announced its intention to support the Police Federation offering membership to special constables in July 2019.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Will the Police Covenant be the same as the Armed Forces Covenant?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Police Covenant will recognise the specific needs of those working, or who have worked, in policing and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are clearly some areas where the demands on military personnel and their families are very different from policing, for example, where families must relocate.</p>

<p>The legislation has been drafted to ensure the Police Covenant Report will reflect the specific, unique needs of the police workforce.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Who will be covered by the Police Covenant?</h3>

<p>The scope of the Covenant will include all those working within, or retired from, policing roles, whether paid or as a  volunteer. This includes police officers, special constables, police staff and community or police support volunteers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Will this give police a licence to drive dangerously?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>No. If a police officer were to drive at a speed or in a manner that was inappropriate under the circumstances, they would still be liable to be brought before the courts or disciplinary        proceedings.&nbsp;Police officers should take    account of guidance found within the College of Policing’s Authorised Professional Practice and reflected in their training on whether a tactic is appropriate, including that pursuits must be proportionate and consider risk    factors before deciding to pursue.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>What difference will the Covenant make to a police officer’s life?</h3>

<p>The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring the Covenant has a meaningful impact on the lives of those working within, or retired from, policing roles.</p>

<p>The Covenant will be based on the principle that people in these roles, or retired from, do not suffer any detriment as a result of working in policing.</p>

<p>In addition, it will aim to ensure that every officer is able to access the same standard of    Occupational Health support in every force.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>How will the Covenant help families like PC Harper’s?</h3>

<p>Recent tragic events such as the deaths of PC Andrew Harper and Sgt Matt Ratana have quite rightly brought support for families under the spotlight. The Government will prioritise this under the Covenant by considering whether there is anything more that can be done at a  national level to support bereaved police families.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>How will this new test be judged in the courts and how will this be fair?</h3>

<p>The new test strikes the right balance between giving trained officers the confidence they need to fight crime effectively while holding to account those who drive in an inappropriate manner.&nbsp;Police driver experts will be able to give objective advice on the legal test, including the training of police drivers.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span>Why are you not widening the new test to encompass other emergency services such as ambulance and fire services?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The training and scrutiny of police driving is very different compared to other emergency services. In addition the role of police drivers is more varied than that of the other       emergency services; in addition to emergency response, police are required to carry out surveillance, armed vehicle interventions, escorts, traffic enforcement, and vehicle pursuits, for example where a suspect is fleeing the scene of a serious crime or otherwise seeking to avoid arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span>Why are you amending the law to enable special constables to join the Police Federation? Can’t the Federation just extend membership to special constables?</h3>

<p>Special constables are not currently eligible to join the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW). The Police Act 1996 provides for the PFEW to represent “members of a police force”. This term does not include special constables.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span>Why is the Government not funding subscriptions?</h3>

<p>The Home Office currently provides free access to an insurance policy for all special constables, to cover the costs of legal advice in the event of disciplinary proceedings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span>What will happen to the Association of Special Constabulary Officers?</h3>

<p>The Association of Special Constabulary Officers plays an important role in ensuring the voice of special constables is represented across policing. They are developing their future offer to special constables and are working with the Federation, National Police Chiefs’ Council and others to ensure specials are fully supported.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.11 </span>Who will pay for special constables’ Federation membership?</h3>

<p>The Police Federation have expressed, for some time, an interest in representing special constables. We understand they are currently exploring funding options.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.12 </span>Will the Government continue to provide free insurance once the Federation start offering membership to special constables? &nbsp;</h3>

<p>We want to be sure that special constables continue to feel supported, including those who may choose not to join the Federation. We will work closely with our policing partners to consider how this can be done as the Federation implements their offer to special constables.</p>
