  <p class="last-child">Investigators must observe the absolute right to a fair trial and the right to privacy.&nbsp; These considerations apply particularly in the extraction of data from mobile devices, which is increasingly a reasonable line of enquiry in criminal investigations.&nbsp;The proposed legislation would provide to practitioners and stakeholders much needed certainty in respect of the relevant law along with where, when and how it should be applied.&nbsp;This will serve to increase confidence in a critical area of investigative practice.&nbsp;The NPCC therefore supports this Bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tim de Meyer, National Police Chiefs’ Council Lead for Disclosure</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We are going to strengthen the law that governs use of digital information extraction as part of criminal investigations through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introducing a new statutory power to ensure that the police can obtain digital evidence to prosecute  criminals whilst strengthening whilst providing additional safeguards so that only    information that is relevant to the investigation is taken. This is needed to protect privacy and to support victims of crime and others who voluntarily provide information to the police</li>
  <li>Publishing a code of practice to guide authorities and provide clarity and consistency in their  approach to obtaining digital evidence from victims and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>We will introduce a new power so that authorities investigating a crime, safeguarding the public or investigating a death can extract information from digital devices with the agreement of the user. This means that where a victim or a witness has information on a device such as a mobile phone that they want to give to the police there will be an appropriate power and an agreed process for that to happen.</p>

<p>This will be a non-coercive power, that can only be used with the agreement of the user (other than in limited circumstances e.g. where the device user is deceased) and will be  applicable to authorities, such as the police, who might use the information to support investigations, including coronial investigations, or to protect vulnerable people from harm.</p>

<p>We will also issue a statutory code of practice which will give practical guidance to            authorities on the use of the power, including how to determine which legal power to use in the circumstances and how they should confirm that extraction of that information is         necessary and proportionate. This is needed to ensure that authorities exercise their      functions in accordance with the law and protect the privacy of victims and witnesses. The code will ensure a greater understanding on the use of the power and its application.</p>

<p>The provisions and code will ensure that authorities are acting with respect for individuals’ privacy and will include a specific responsibility to ensure that other, less intrusive means of obtaining relevant information are considered before extracting information from individuals’ devices.</p>

<p>It will also confirm that information must only be taken where it is absolutely necessary to the investigation and not as a matter of course.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Background</h2>

<p>With so much more of our lives being lived online, important information for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime is now held on digital devices and the use of this information is a routine part of many investigations.</p>

<p>Public confidence in making this type of information available is therefore critical to confidence in the criminal justice system and to the right to a fair trial. The Attorney General’s review of disclosure, published in November 2018, recommended changes to guidance in order to  respond to the increase of digital material in the criminal justice system, including evidence found on mobile phones. The review also identified the need for greater use of technology to ensure that digital material is properly considered at all stages in the criminal justice system. Extensive action has been underway to bring about the necessary change within the CPS and policing.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Court of Appeal judgment in R v. Bater-James [2020] EWCA Crim 790, set out when, and how, information belonging to an individual should be examined. The Court        recognised the need to avoid undue invasion of the individual’s privacy, which is necessary if the individual is to have confidence in the process, while also achieving the overriding aims of the criminal justice system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">There is no presumption that a complainant’s mobile telephone or other devices should be inspected, retained or downloaded, any more than there is a presumption that investigators will attempt to look through material held in hard copy. There must be a properly identifiable foundation for the inquiry, not mere conjecture or speculation. Furthermore, as developed below, if there is a reasonable line of enquiry, the investigators should consider whether there are ways of readily accessing the information that do not involve looking at or taking possession of the complainant’s mobile telephone or other digital device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concerns over the potential for excessive data processing have also been raised by victim support, privacy groups and by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which published a report on mobile phone data extraction in June 2020. The ICO’s report identified               inconsistencies in the approach police take to the extraction of data and the complex legal framework that governs this practice, especially where the device belongs to a victim or       witness of crime. The ICO recommended clarifying the lawful basis for data extraction and   introducing a code of practice in order to increase consistency and ensure that any data taken is strictly necessary for the purpose of the investigation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Why does this provision apply beyond police forces?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The process of extraction of information from digital devices is currently undertaken by a range of authorities with investigatory functions, not just police forces. This provision ensures the legal basis for this practice to be undertaken is consistent across all authorities who use it.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>What else is the Government doing to ensure that an individual’s right to privacy is respected and that excessive processing is limited?</h3>

<p>Information will only be requested when it is necessary for the investigation and there is a reasonable belief that the device holds material that is relevant to an investigation. It should be handled and processed in line with privacy and data protection legislation.&nbsp; This power will reinforce these requirements by including an additional privacy safeguarding requirement to consider, before use, if there are alternative means of getting the information that impact less on the privacy of the individual.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Will authorities force individuals to hand over their device for digital extraction?</h3>

<p>No, victims will not be forced to hand over information. The NPCC have refined the digital processing notice (DPN) that they use to explain to victims what will happen to their   data and how it will be used. Police will use a DPN when exercising this power and this will ensure that victims know their rights, including their right to say no.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Will information ever be extracted without the agreement of the user?</h3>

<p>In specific circumstances, such as where the user is vulnerable or missing and there is a risk to their life or of serious harm to them, information may be extracted without the agreement of the user.  In all other circumstances, agreement must be given before extraction takes place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>Why is it necessary for this power to be introduced?</h3>

<p>Introducing this power will provide clarity, ensure consistency in processes and instill greater confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span>What will the code of practice do?</h3>

<p>The code will provide guidance for authorities on how they exercise the power, including obtaining agreement of the device user and the privacy safeguards that must be considered      before use.</p>
