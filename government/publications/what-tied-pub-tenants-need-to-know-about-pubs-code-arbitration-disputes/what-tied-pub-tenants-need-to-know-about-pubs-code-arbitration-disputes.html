<span class="number">1. </span>Arbitration referrals</h2>

<p>What is an arbitration under the Pubs Code?</p>

<p>If you have a dispute with your pub-owning business (POB) about how it is applying the Code or 
about your Pubs Code rights, and you cannot resolve it, that dispute may be referred to the Pubs 
Code Adjudicator (PCA) to be decided by an arbitrator. The Code says that the PCA can either 
arbitrate that dispute or appoint another person to do so. 
Arbitration gives you an independent decision on a dispute instead of going to court. Arbitration is 
the dispute resolution method for the Code. The party referring the dispute is the ‘claimant’. The 
other party is the ‘respondent’.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If you do not think the POB has complied with the Code, you may be able to resolve matters 
without the need for arbitration. You can raise any Code matter with your POB’s Code 
Compliance Officer, whose role it is to verify the POB’s compliance with the Pubs Code.</p>

<p>The contact details for each Code Compliance Officer are available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-compliance-officer-information/code-compliance-officer-cco-contact-details">here</a>.</p>

<p>The PCA expects the POB to attempt to resolve the issue to avoid the need for arbitration.
<strong>Even after a referral for arbitration is made, wherever possible you and the POB should 
continue to negotiate about the matter in dispute to try and resolve it.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>When the arbitrator makes a decision in the case, their decision is called an award. The parties 
may instead reach an agreement between them, and the arbitrator may then issue an ‘agreed 
award’. An arbitration award is legally binding, which means that if an arbitrator orders your POB 
to take an action, it must do it.</p>

<p>Both the arbitration process and the award are confidential between you and the POB, unless you 
both agree otherwise. Where consent is given, the PCA routinely <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/judgments-in-arbitration-appeals-and-publication-of-arbitration-awards/judgments-in-arbitration-appeals-and-publication-of-arbitration-awards">publishes awards</a> made in Pubs 
Code arbitrations, and may otherwise publish summaries of awards, to help the industry
understand how the Code is being applied in individual cases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What disputes may be referred to the PCA?</h2>

<p>Disputes about the Market Rent Only (MRO) process may be referred by either the tied pub tenant 
(TPT) or the POB. All other disputes may be referred only by a TPT.</p>

<p><strong>Market Rent Only disputes</strong></p>

<p>If a dispute arises between you and the POB about your request for a MRO option this can be 
referred for arbitration. This includes if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You and the POB disagree about whether you are entitled to request MRO</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You think the POB’s MRO full response is incomplete</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You and the POB disagree about whether the MRO tenancy terms it has offered you are MRO-compliant, including if you think they are unreasonable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You or the POB think that the rent amount determined by an Independent Assessor is not the MRO market rent</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Full details of the MRO procedure and what issues can be referred for arbitration can be found in 
the PCA’s factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/market-rent-only-mro-rights">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know about Market Rent Only (MRO) rights</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>When should I make a referral to the PCA for arbitration?</h2>

<p><strong>Market Rent Only disputes</strong></p>

<p>There are strict time limits for when a referral for arbitration can be made at different stages of the 
MRO procedure. Full details of the MRO procedure and the timings of when issues can be 
referred for arbitration can be found in the PCA’s factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/market-rent-only-mro-rights">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know 
about Market Rent Only (MRO) rights</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other Code disputes</strong></p>

<p><strong>See Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 – sections 48 and 49</strong></p>

<p>To make a referral about a dispute (which is not part of the MRO process) you need to take the 
following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notify the POB of the issue and the fact that you think it has not complied with the Code</li>
  <li>Wait 21 days after notifying the POB</li>
  <li>Make the referral to the PCA after the end of the 21 days. To be accepted you <strong>must</strong> make 
the referral within 4 months beginning with the first date on which the dispute could have 
been referred</li>
</ol>

<p>Information about the PCA’s view on the time limit for a TPT to refer a dispute for arbitration (other 
than MRO disputes) can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pca-advice-note-timing-of-referral-for-arbitration-by-tied-pub-tenants-non-mro-disputes/pca-advice-note-timing-of-referral-for-arbitration-by-tied-pub-tenants-non-mro-disputes">PCA Advice Note: Timing of referral for arbitration by tied pub 
tenants (non-MRO disputes)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Worked example</strong></p>

<p>Your POB has provided you with a Rent Assessment Proposal (RAP) on 1 July. If you do not 
think it complies with the Code, you must give the POB written notice of this. You must then 
give the POB 21 days to resolve the issue before you can refer the dispute to the PCA. The 
earliest date on which you could give written notice to the POB is 1 July and so the earliest you 
could make a referral is 21 July.</p>

<p>You have four months to make a referral from the first day on which you could have made that 
referral - so you would have up to and including 21 November (four months and 21 days from 
the alleged breach of the Pubs Code) to make a referral to the PCA.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>See Pubs Code - regulation 60</strong></p>

<p>Your tenancy agreement may have its <strong>own dispute resolution provisions</strong>. If your POB 
starts arbitration proceedings under the tenancy in relation to a matter which is about MRO, 
you may appoint the PCA to arbitrate the dispute.</p>

<p>In those circumstances you must give written notice of this request to both the POB and the 
PCA within 21 days of the arbitral proceedings beginning. Where the contractual arbitration 
arrangements provide for someone other than the TPT or the POB to appoint the arbitrator,
the TPT must give this notice within 21 days from the date they are told who is being proposed 
as arbitrator.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>How do I make a referral for arbitration to the PCA?</h2>

<p>Pubs Code arbitration referrals are managed by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators (CIArb) on behalf of the PCA. If you are making a referral you will need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ciarb.org/disputes/schemes/pubs-code-adjudicator-arbitration-service/" rel="external">referral form</a> and send this to the CIArb Dispute Appointment Service team. 
The form can be emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:pca@ciarb.org">pca@ciarb.org</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pay a referral fee of £200.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Full details of the form to complete and how to pay the referral fee are on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ciarb.org/disputes/schemes/pubs-code-adjudicator-arbitration-service/" rel="external">CIArb website</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Is it possible to appeal an award made in a Pubs Code arbitration?</h2>

<p><strong>See Arbitration Act 1996 – sections 67 to 71</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can appeal the award to the High Court, but only on limited grounds. These include a challenge to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, a challenge on a point of law (in some limited circumstances) or if there has been a serious irregularity affecting the arbitrator, the proceedings or the award. For example, a serious irregularity may be alleged if the arbitrator has either failed to deal with all the issues that were before them or has gone beyond what they have the power to do.</p>

<p>If you are considering pursuing an appeal, you may wish to take independent legal advice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Arbitration costs</h2>

<p><strong>See Fees Regulations – regulations 3 and 4. Also see, Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 – section 51(6)</strong></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>What costs might I or the POB have to pay in connection to an arbitration?</h2>

<p><strong>Referral Fee</strong></p>

<p>When a referral is made the person making the referral will need to pay a £200 referral fee.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitrator’s costs</strong></p>

<p>The arbitrator is entitled to charge for their work done in arbitrating the dispute. The Pubs Code 
framework says the <strong>POB must pay the reasonable fees and expenses of an arbitrator</strong>. The 
exception to this is if the arbitrator decides that your referral was vexatious, in which case they can 
require you to pay some or all of their fees and expenses.</p>

<p>The arbitrator’s expenses include the fees and expenses of any experts, legal advisers or 
technical assessors that the arbitrator appoints.</p>

<p><strong>Parties’ costs</strong></p>

<p>If you instruct a professional adviser to act for you in an arbitration, you will be responsible for their 
fees. Information about what to consider when instructing a professional adviser can be found in 
the PCA’s factsheet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/getting-help-and-support-with-the-pubs-code-and-arbitration/what-tied-pub-tenants-need-to-know-about-getting-help-and-support-with-the-pubs-code-and-arbitration">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know about Getting Help and Support with 
the Pubs Code and Arbitration</a>.</p>

<p>You and the POB can agree between you whether one of you should pay some of the other’s
costs incurred in the arbitration. If you do not agree, the arbitrator can order that one party pays 
the costs of another party. This includes the costs of a professional adviser to act in the arbitration.</p>

<p>The arbitrator will decide whether and how much to award in costs taking into account the 
circumstances of each case. The usual position is that the party who was unsuccessful in the 
arbitration pays some or all of the costs incurred by the successful party, unless there are 
circumstances where the arbitrator considers this is not appropriate.</p>

<p>Before deciding whether to make a costs award, the arbitrator will ask the parties to explain their 
views on which party (if either) should pay the costs of the other and what the appropriate amount 
of costs awarded should be. If a party is asking that the other pay their costs, they should usually 
provide to the arbitrator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a description of each activity included in the claim; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of how the costs have been incurred.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Note: If you have not instructed a professional adviser to represent you, you may be able to 
claim costs from the POB for your time spent on an arbitration.
The types of activity for which you can claim are usually the types of work for which costs could 
have been claimed if a legal representative had carried them out on your behalf.</p>

<p>When deciding whether to order that one party pays the costs of the other, and how much they 
should pay, the arbitrator is likely to consider the complexity of the case and whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the activities claimed for were necessary or appropriate in the circumstances of the case;</li>
  <li>the amounts claimed for those activities are reasonable;</li>
  <li>the level of costs is proportionate to the sums in dispute;</li>
  <li>the party complied with orders and directions issued by the arbitrator; and</li>
  <li>any other factors which the arbitrator in their discretion considers relevant.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Is there a maximum amount I could be required to pay in connection to the POB’s costs?</strong></p>

<p>If the arbitrator decides that you should pay some of the POB’s costs, <strong>usually the maximum they can order you to pay is £2,000</strong>. They can only order you to pay more if they decide that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>your referral was vexatious, OR</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>your conduct (including that of any representative acting for you in the arbitration) in connection 
with the arbitration resulted in an unreasonable increase in the costs of the arbitration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is <strong>no maximum that a POB can be ordered to pay</strong> – if the arbitrator thinks it appropriate,
they can order that the POB pays all of your costs of the arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>Worked example – costs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note: the purpose of this worked example is to illustrate the operation of the costs 
process and should not be taken as any kind of advice or an indication of the potential 
outcome in any individual arbitration.</strong></p>

<p>The arbitrator has found that the POB’s Rent Assessment Proposal (RAP) did not comply with 
the Code. The TPT argued in the arbitration that the RAP was not compliant with the Code for 
three reasons. The arbitrator accepted one of these reasons was correct and ordered the POB 
to send a new RAP. But the arbitrator rejected two of the reasons the TPT had put forward.</p>

<p>The TPT and the POB are given the opportunity to send written arguments to the arbitrator 
about who should be required to pay costs and how much.</p>

<p>The TPT had paid fees of £3,500 to a professional adviser who represented them in the 
arbitration. They prepare and send arguments to the arbitrator saying that as the TPT was 
successful in the arbitration the POB should be required to pay all the TPT’s costs. They 
include a breakdown of how the fee was incurred, including the hourly rate, the activities carried 
out in the case and how long each activity took.</p>

<p>The POB argues that it should not be required to pay 100% of the TPT’s costs because not all
its allegations about the RAP were successful and because it claims the representative’s fee is 
unreasonably high for the work done.</p>

<p>The arbitrator will look at all the circumstances, including the breakdown of activities carried out 
by the professional adviser and the degree to which the TPT was successful in their arguments. 
The arbitrator will decide whether to reduce the costs the POB has to pay, for example, to 
exclude the cost of any activities carried out by the TPT’s professional adviser that were not 
necessary, reasonable or proportionate.</p>

<p>The arbitrator’s fees and expenses were £6,000. The arbitrator must order the POB to pay the 
whole of these costs unless the TPT’s referral was vexatious.</p>
