<h2>When</h2>

<p>Friday 8 July to Saturday 9 July 2022, 7am to 6pm.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>Henley reach, Temple Island to the Upper Thames Rowing Club.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Those in charge of all boats in the vicinity of this event must conform with these directions and with any special directions which, at the discretion of a Harbour Master, may be required in particular circumstances during these dates.</p>

<p>Between 7am and 6pm on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 July 2022, the Henley Masters Regatta will take place on the Henley Royal Regatta course between Temple Island and Upper Thames Rowing Club.</p>

<p>During the above times, no unauthorised boats can navigate within the regatta course booms on the Berks side of the river.</p>

<p>The navigation channel for river traffic will be on the Bucks Bank, Fawley Court side of the river. Normal rules of navigation will apply in the navigation channel and boats must navigate with particular care and caution.</p>

<p>All vessels on the Henley Reach during these times should keep a good look out for participants and safety boats.</p>

<p>Between 7am on Friday 8 July and 6pm on Saturday 9 July only open powered boats, i.e. those without awnings or cabins and unpowered boats can moor alongside the course downstream of line A at Barn Elms Boathouse on the map overleaf.</p>

<p>At no time may any boats be moored within the regatta course, to the bank in the area known as the Narrows, or to adjacent regatta course booms (The Narrows is indicated with an X on the map below).</p>

<p>No boat can be left unattended to the regatta course booms, piles or boxes at any time.</p>

<p>Additional directions for mooring may be given by Navigation Officers as required.</p>

<p>Those in charge of boats should also be aware that they are responsible for avoiding collision and should use all available means appropriate to the circumstances and conditions to decide if there is a risk of immediate danger and avoid it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we hereby advise that the regatta course including all of the piles, booms and boxes are the property of Henley Royal Regatta.  The Regatta may choose to take civil action against any person who causes damage to their structures.</p>

<p>It is an offence to fail to conform with the directions in this notice or to obstruct an officer of the Environment Agency in the execution of their duty or to fail to obey directions given regarding the navigation, mooring or unmooring of any boat.</p>

<h2>Byelaws</h2>

<p>Nothing contained in these directions shall supersede those parts of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993 and the UK Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996 as may be relevant. Particular attention should be paid to byelaws 24-42 of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993, Steering Sailing and Speed.</p>

<p>And Notice is hereby given, that it is provided by Byelaw 52 of the Thames Navigation Licensing and General Byelaws 1993 that:</p>

<p>The master of any vessel shall except in an emergency not pass any boat-race regatta public procession or gathering for the launch of a vessel or any other event or function which may cause a crowd to assemble on or by the river nor station his vessel thereon in such a manner as would risk obstructing impeding or interfering with such boat-race regatta procession launching event or function or endangering the safety of persons assembling on the river or preventing or interfering with the maintenance of order thereon.</p>

<p>The maximum penalty for breach of the Byelaws is £1,000.</p>
