<span class="number">3. </span>Information: updated high needs benchmarking tool</h2>

<p>We have published an updated version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-benchmarking-tool">high needs benchmarking tool</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities can use this tool to assess their own level of need, spend and pattern of provision against those of neighbouring local authorities (both geographically and statistically) and national trends. Analysis of the data on the tool will help inform local authorities’ future plans and prompt local discussion of how current spending patterns might need to change.</p>

<p>This version of the tool includes new section 251 data (2019 to 2020 outturn), special educational needs (SEN) data for January 2020 and provisional high needs national funding formula allocations for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The population figures have been updated onwards from 2017 using more recent estimates and projections.</p>

<p>The statistical neighbours for local authorities have been updated in line with those published on 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>We also plan to update the management plan template which incorporates the HN benchmarking tool. We will keep all local authorities informed of when we release the next version.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="mailto:Financial.MANAGEMENT@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">contact us</a>.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: adult education budget (AEB) West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) postcode file</h2>

<p>To support the devolution of the AEB to the West Yorkshire Combined authority (WYCA), we have published a one-off file detailing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-postcode-files" class="govuk-link">postcodes that the WYCA will be responsible for funding for starts from 1 August 2021</a>. </p>

<p>You can use this data file to support learner enrolment and aid your assessment of which learners will be funded by the WYCA, based on where each learner is likely to be residing at the start of their learning.  </p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: Women’s health - Let’s talk about it</h2>

<p>The government has launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/womens-health-strategy-call-for-evidence?utm_campaign=talk-womens-health&amp;utm_medium=o&amp;utm_source=st&amp;utm_content=">12 week call for evidence to better understand women’s experiences of the health and care system</a>.</p>

<p>The call for evidence will form the basis of a landmark government-led Women’s Health Strategy, to improve the health and wellbeing of women across England and place women’s voices at the centre of their care. By better understanding women’s experiences, the government can ensure key parts of the health service are meeting women’s needs as they should be.</p>

<p>Everyone aged 16 and over is welcome to contribute to the call for evidence, as well as people who live with and care for women, organisations with experience of providing services for women and those with an expertise in women’s health are also encouraged to share their views.</p>

<p>The easiest way to participate in the call for evidence as an individual is by <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consultations.dhsc.gov.uk/talkwomenshealth">completing the public survey</a> which is quick to fill in and easily accessible from people’s mobiles. This consultation closes at 11:45pm on 30 May 2021.</p>

<p>We’d be grateful if you could share the consultation widely with your networks to ensure wide-ranging and diverse views are reflected. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PXyBVNWDozx77WA_ps6N5_mViF936-bf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Social media assets</a> are available to support sharing with your audiences and we also encourage you to use the #TalkWomensHealth hashtag when posting on social media.</p>
