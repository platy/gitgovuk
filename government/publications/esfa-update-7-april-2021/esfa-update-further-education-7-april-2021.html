<span class="number">6. </span>Information: adult education budget (AEB) West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) postcode file</h2>

<p>To support the devolution of the AEB to the West Yorkshire Combined authority (WYCA), we have published a one-off file detailing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-education-budget-aeb-postcode-files" class="govuk-link">postcodes that the WYCA will be responsible for funding for starts from 1 August 2021</a>. </p>

<p>You can use this data file to support learner enrolment and aid your assessment of which learners will be funded by the WYCA, based on where each learner is likely to be resident at the start of their learning.  </p>

<p>We have used postcode information which the Office for National Statistics published in February 2021. </p>

<p>We will follow this up shortly with a full postcode dataset covering all funding bodies in England including the WYCA, at which point we will remove this dataset. </p>

<p>These documents set out the rules for apprenticeship funding, including the evidence required to support it and apply to apprenticeship starts from 1 August 2020. </p>

<p>These rules are being published following the publication of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding" class="govuk-link">April 2021 policy changes</a> and will reflect these changes. They should be read alongside the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-apprenticeship-programme-response" class="govuk-link">apprenticeship response to coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> as some of these flexibilities are continuing. </p>

<span class="number">8. </span>Information: new guide for training providers – how to deliver high quality apprenticeships</h2>

<p>A new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/provider-guide-to-delivering-high-quality-apprenticeships">guide for training providers</a> giving step-by-step advice on how to deliver a high-quality apprenticeship is now available online.</p>

<p>This guide, informed by the sector and various quality bodies, is for all providers delivering apprenticeships at any level. It sets out all the minimum requirements and the building blocks required to support the delivery of high-quality apprenticeships for newer providers. It also supports the continuous development of more experienced providers by updating them on the latest requirements and highlighting good practice.</p>

<p>It includes links to more detailed guidance on specific topics, such as off the job training, ‘gateway’ and end point assessment. These will be updated as further resources become available.</p>

<p>We will be seeking further feedback in due course to inform new resources and subsequent versions of the guide. If at any time you would be happy to share your thoughts, please email <a href="mailto:apprenticeships.qualitypolicy@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">apprenticeships.qualitypolicy@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Similar resources will follow for employers, end-point assessment organisations and apprentices, reflecting that successful apprenticeships are based on a strong partnership between the provider, employer and apprentice.</p>

<span class="number">10. </span>Information: Women’s health - Let’s talk about it</h2>

<p>The government has launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/womens-health-strategy-call-for-evidence?utm_campaign=talk-womens-health&amp;utm_medium=o&amp;utm_source=st&amp;utm_content=">12 week call for evidence to better understand women’s experiences of the health and care system</a>.</p>

<p>The call for evidence will form the basis of a landmark government-led Women’s Health Strategy, to improve the health and wellbeing of women across England and place women’s voices at the centre of their care. By better understanding women’s experiences, the government can ensure key parts of the health service are meeting women’s needs as they should be.</p>

<p>Everyone aged 16 and over is welcome to contribute to the call for evidence, as well as people who live with and care for women, organisations with experience of providing services for women and those with an expertise in women’s health are also encouraged to share their views.</p>

<p>The easiest way to participate in the call for evidence as an individual is by <a href="https://consultations.dhsc.gov.uk/talkwomenshealth" class="govuk-link" rel="external">completing the public survey</a> which is quick to fill in and easily accessible from people’s mobiles. This consultation closes at 11:45pm on 30 May 2021.</p>

<p>We’d be grateful if you could share the consultation widely with your networks to ensure wide-ranging and diverse views are reflected. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PXyBVNWDozx77WA_ps6N5_mViF936-bf" rel="external">Social media assets</a> are available to support sharing with your audiences and we also encourage you to use the #TalkWomensHealth hashtag when posting on social media.</p>
