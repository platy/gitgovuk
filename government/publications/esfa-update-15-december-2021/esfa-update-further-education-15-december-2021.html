<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Information: latest coronavirus (COVID-19) updates for FE</h2>

<p>You will have seen the message delivered by the Prime Minister on Sunday evening to update on the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron. With the evidence showing that this variant is spreading fast, it is absolutely vital that all those eligible have both doses of the vaccine and those aged 18 and over get boosted now to build a wall of defence against Omicron.</p>

<p>There are several things settings can do to help reduce transmission and protect young people’s education. The following contains some important messaging on what you can do to support this effort; on vaccinations, support with space, home testing, daily testing and face coverings.</p>

<p>We continue to learn more about the impacts of the Omicron variant. To prepare for any possible changes in public health advice, you should continue to revisit your existing outbreak plans to ensure your setting is well prepared for any future changes and ensure they are familiar with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings/contingency-framework-education-and-childcare-settings?utm_source=7%20December%202021%20C19&amp;utm_medium=Daily%20Email%20C19&amp;utm_campaign=DfE%20C19">Contingency Framework Guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>Vaccinations</h3>

<p>We need your support. The new Omicron COVID-19 variant is spreading fast. Anyone who is unvaccinated or who hasn’t had their booster is at even greater risk from COVID-19 and more serious illness. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves and help keep children and young people in face-to-face education.</p>

<p>People aged 18 years and over will be invited for a booster jab before the end of the year. Please encourage your staff and eligible students in your settings to take up the booster dose as soon as they can.</p>

<p>All eligible students under 18 returning to education in January who have not yet had their first or second dose can also take up the vaccine offer; it is a priority that students can continue to fully participate in their education, which includes the opportunity to sit and demonstrate their learning in exams.</p>

<p>With the acceleration of the vaccination and booster programme, the NHS has reopened recruitment for both paid and volunteer roles to support existing vaccine teams in protecting those who need it.</p>

<p>As a result, there are now additional opportunities to volunteer to support the accelerated rollout, with a range of flexible roles available with full training provided. The roles available are all flexible and range from vaccinators (paid and volunteer) and registered healthcare professionals to healthcare support workers, administrators and steward volunteers.</p>

<p>We would like you to share this ask across your networks, and in particular encourage health and social care staff and students to step forward who may have particular skills and experience suitable to support the effort. By volunteering, they will be joining a team which is saving lives and helping the country return to normal life.</p>

<p>Further information on the type of roles available and how to sign up is available on the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/join-the-nhs-covid-19-vaccine-team/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS website</a>.</p>

<h3>Support with space</h3>

<p>One additional emerging requirement is for additional support to train new vaccinators. This requires a physical building, clinical staff, and volunteers to help administrate and organise sessions for new vaccinators. We are very interested in hearing from any FE providers able to offer support for this, which is required in all 7 NHS regions. If this is something you can offer, please reply to <a href="mailto:fecovid-19.programmeteam@Education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">FE Operational Planning Team</a> with your institution, name, email address and details of what you can offer by close of play of 16th December. Apologies for the quick turnaround but as you can imagine; it is vital this information is shared quickly.</p>

<p>In addition, if you haven’t already, please contact your local health authorities if you can offer space/ staff/ students to support the local roll-out, so they can factor that into their planning. DfE is keen to support you in this as much as we can, so please let us know if there are any barriers that we can help overcome.</p>

<h3>Home test kits for January</h3>

<p>Asymptomatic twice weekly at-home testing, using Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs), will continue in the new year. Getting all staff and students testing is essential to help identify cases early and help reduce transmission, which will help keep young people in face-to-face education.</p>

<p>You should encourage students and staff to continue regular LFD testing and to report all results – whether they are negative, void, or positive – both to the NHS Online reporting system and to their education setting ahead of January return. You may want to use end of term messages to reinforce the importance of reporting and testing.</p>

<p>You will be able to continue to order test kits to enable your workforce and students to continue testing at home during the spring term through the online ordering system. If you need additional test kits on return in the first week of January, please place an order before you break up for the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>Any orders placed between Thursday 9 December and 5pm Tuesday 28 December will be delivered in the week commencing 3 January 2022. When placing your order, please advise in the delivery instructions that your order is required for testing during the first week of January and confirm the date that your setting reopens.</p>

<p>Orders for test kits required after the first week of January and throughout the spring term should be placed when you return in January. The usual ordering and delivery pattern will resume from Wednesday 5 January, so any orders placed by 5pm on a Tuesday will be delivered during the following week.</p>

<p>There will be no deliveries scheduled during week commencing 20 December or week commencing 27 December.</p>

<p>Further information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jYv0MjFyIIbzgPn_1S10OuRgfrj_b5_P">document sharing platform</a>.</p>

<h3>Daily Testing for Contacts of COVID-19</h3>

<p>From Tuesday 14 December, a new national approach to daily testing for contacts of COVID-19 is being introduced (including until the end of this term). All adults who are fully vaccinated and young people aged 18 years and 6 months to 5, identified as a contact of someone with COVID-19 – whether Omicron or not – should take a lateral flow device (LFD) test every day for 7 days instead of self-isolating. Daily testing by close contacts will help to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>All staff and students should have access to a box of 7 LFD tests from their education setting. If your setting requires additional test kits sooner than they would be available through the standard ordering process, or will run out of test kits imminently, you can contact 119 to request an emergency replenishment.</p>

<p>Anyone over the age of 18 years and 6 months who is not vaccinated, must isolate in line with government guidelines if they are a close contact of a positive case.</p>

<p>For students with SEND who struggle to or are unable to self-swab daily for 7 days, settings should work with students and their families to agree an appropriate testing route, such as assisted swabbing. Information on further support measures will be provided.</p>

<h3>Delivery of face coverings to support contingency stock</h3>

<p>We expect most staff and students already have access to face coverings. However, it is recommended that all settings have a small contingency stock of face coverings available if an individual has forgotten or damaged their own. To support this, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) will deliver face coverings to settings. This will be a similar number to those delivered to settings in March 2021.</p>

<p>FE settings should expect to receive a delivery in January. These face coverings are being provided by DHSC at no cost to your setting.</p>

<p>For any queries or complaints relating to deliveries or missing items, please contact the DHSC PPE helpline (provided by UNIPART) on 0800 8766802, identifying yourself as an education setting. Alternatively, you can email <a href="mailto:dfeppequeries@unipart.com" class="govuk-link">dfeppequeries@unipart.com</a> and your query will be handled by the helpline team.</p>

<p>For any questions on DfE face covering policy, please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education/face-coverings-in-education?utm_source=10%20December%202021%20C19&amp;utm_medium=Daily%20Email%20C19&amp;utm_campaign=DfE%20C19" class="govuk-link">DfE guidance</a> or call the DfE (COVID-19) helpline on 0800 046 8687.</p>

<p>We have updated the 16 to 19 tuition fund guidance to provide clarification on third party delivery of the tuition fund, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-funding-16-to-19-tuition-fund" class="govuk-link">guidance can be found on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Information: updated provider data self-assessment toolkit</h2>

<p>We have released an updated version of the provider data self-assessment toolkit (PDSAT) on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ilr-data-provider-data-self-assessment-toolkit-pdsat" class="govuk-link">PDSAT section</a> of GOV.UK.</p>

<p>This version includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an update to the sampler, enabling users to select audit samples and output a set of audit working papers for the 2021 to 2022 funding year</li>
  <li>a new PDSAT report that identifies 16 to 19 study programmes containing significant levels of non-qualification activity</li>
</ul>

<p>PDSAT is available to providers of ESFA funded education and training to assist with their routine ILR data-checking procedures for their ILR data returns and with preparation for funding assurance reviews.</p>

<p>For further information, please use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen" rel="external">ESFA online form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Information: reviewing PDSAT reports: updated user guide</h2>

<p>We have published an update to the user guide for reviewing provider data self-assessment toolkit (PDSAT) for the 2021 to 2022 funding year on the PDSAT section of GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The update includes advice on how to review the new PDSAT report, 22Y-218, that identifies 16 to 19 study programmes containing significant levels of non-qualification activity.</p>

<p>The user guide assists providers of ESFA-funded education and training in carrying out their routine data cleansing and submitting accurate ILR data returns to the ESFA.  Therefore, we encourage providers to use PDSAT to regularly check ILR data and, thus, minimise the risk of overclaiming funds from the ESFA and subsequent repayment of funds. The guide is also used by the ESFA and accountancy firms in the delivery of funding audits.</p>
