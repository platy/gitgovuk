<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Defence and Security Accelerator (DASA) supported by Innovate UK Loans Ltd (Innovate UK) are working together to offer a new Defence funding competition: the Defence Innovation Loan, which currently has a total of £10M available to fund Innovative Defence solutions. This service provides an opportunity for single small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with solutions to Defence themed problems to apply for a Defence Innovation Loan of between £250,000 and £1.6 million with a below market interest rate of 7.4% per annum. This loan can be used to cover up to 100% of eligible project costs to aid the commercialisation of the solution. Innovate UK provide further information on innovation loans (not Defence specific) <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovation-loans-what-they-are-and-how-to-apply">here</a>. The funding available for this competition comprises £5M from the Defence Innovation Fund and £5M from Army.</p>

<p>DASA will conduct a full innovation assessment by defence stakeholders on submitted proposals, focusing on desirability, feasibility and viability of the solution, as per the standard <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-your-proposal-is-assessed">DASA competition process</a>. It should be noted that the standard DASA Terms and Conditions will not apply to applications deemed acceptable and instead, the Innovate UK Innovation Loans <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996418/IUK-230421-Innovation-Loans-Terms-and-Conditions-April-2021.pdf" rel="external">Terms and Conditions</a> will  apply should the application be acceptable to be considered for a UK Innovation Loan.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the DASA assessment, Innovate UK will also undertake a credit evaluation of your business to assess suitability for a Defence Innovation Loan. These checks will include suitability to make repayments and the strength of the company management team to deliver against the plan.</p>

<p>DASA will then consider the proposals at a Decision Conference taking into account the outcome of both the DASA assessment and the Innovate UK credit check. Businesses which are recommended for funding at this ‘initial outcome’ stage will be subject to a detailed loan suitability assessment by Innovate UK.</p>

<p>Innovate UK will offer successful applicants the opportunity to take out a loan to help convert a mature innovative solution into a viable business proposition which may be capable of competing for Defence procurement.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Eligibility</h2>
<p>To take on a Defence Innovation Loan for a project you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a UK registered <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en" rel="external">SME</a>
</li>
  <li>intend either to exploit the results in the UK or exploit the results overseas to make a significant and positive impact on the UK economy and/or productivity</li>
  <li>give evidence that your business is suitable to take on a loan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only SMEs are eligible to apply for Defence Innovation Loans; individuals, academic institutions, research organisations and large companies are not eligible. Only single businesses can receive innovation loans, so collaboration with other organisations cannot be funded in this competition. For more information on company sizes, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#micro-entity">company accounts guidance</a> (this is a change from the EU definition unless you are applying under State Aid).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Subcontractors</h3>
<p>Subcontractors are allowed in this competition and must be selected through a participant’s normal procurement process. Subcontractors can be from anywhere in the UK. If an overseas subcontractor is selected, a case must be made as to why no UK-based subcontractor can be used including a detailed rationale, evidence of UK companies that have been approached and reasons why they were unable to participate. Cost is not deemed as a sufficient reason to use an overseas subcontractor.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Multiple applications</h3>
<p>Your business can only submit one Defence Innovation Loan application at a time. If you submit one or more applications before receiving the outcome of an existing application, only the first application will be considered for assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Funding</h2>
<p>There is currently a total of £10M available to fund Innovative Defence solutions. Loans of between £250,000 and £1.6M will be offered; proposals requesting loans outside of these amounts will be ineligible and will not be considered. The amount offered is based on your project proposal and Innovate UK’s judgement of the suitability and affordability of a loan for your business. The Innovate UK Loans Ltd credit committee will decide the final terms, amount and length of the loan offer.</p>

<p>Innovation loans will be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Available for up to 2 years to cover project development costs when the project is under way, but the exploitation has not yet started (the ‘availability period’). You can borrow in stages (‘drawdowns’) quarterly in advance during this period and will pay interest at 3.7% per annum on anything you borrow, with additional interest at 3.7% accrued and deferred until the repayment period.</li>
  <li>Extended until the first commercial sales from the results of the project, up to a maximum of 2 further years (the ‘extension period’) after the end of the availability period. You will not be able to make further drawdowns during this period. You will not have to make repayments but you will pay interest on the amount you have borrowed at 3.7% per annum, with additional interest at 3.7% accrued and deferred until the repayment period.</li>
  <li>Repayable over a maximum of 5 years (the ‘repayment period’) after the availability and extension periods. You will have to repay anything you have borrowed, including interest accrued and deferred from the availability and extension periods, on a quarterly schedule. You will pay interest at 7.4% per annum on the outstanding loan amount.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are the longest periods that will be considered and, since the overall term of the loan must not exceed 7 years, your application should propose how long your project (which includes the availability and extension periods) will last and how long the repayment period should be. These should be based on the needs of your business. The suitability of your proposed timings will be considered in any loan offer that is made to you.</p>

<p>More details of our approach, including a summary ‘heads of terms’ are set out the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996418/IUK-230421-Innovation-Loans-Terms-and-Conditions-April-2021.pdf" rel="external">terms and conditions</a> of the loan.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>What are we looking for?</h2>
<p>The Defence Innovation Loan has two tracks of funding, covering general Defence solutions and more specific solutions for the Army. To help us assign the best assessors, the application form will ask you to identify which track your proposal  aligns with, but your proposal will be considered for both tracks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Track 1: Defence Innovation Fund (£5M)</h3>
<p>Track 1 is open to innovative ideas to improve the Defence of the UK. Potential solutions may cover any technology area and address any Defence need.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Track 2: Army Innovation Fund (£5M)</h3>
<p>Track 2 is open to innovations which align with any of the priority areas below and targets an Army end user. 
The Army is in many ways a microcosm of society at large, facing many similar challenges: logistical challenges similar to those in retail and distribution companies, data exploitation challenges similar to those of the largest technology companies, challenges in the preparation and delivery of food similar to the largest restaurant chains. The Army has a workforce to be trained, developed and cared for in similar ways to that of any other organisation.  As a result, there are vast opportunities to work with the Army as an incubator for intellectual property that will likely have wider ranging commercial opportunities. The Army priority areas are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Army Industrial Engagement Framework  - Land Capability Science and Technology
Open Systems and Agile Procurement
Decision-Support</li>
  <li>Advantage over Adversaries 
Directed Energy Weapons
Enhanced Platform Performance (e.g. aircraft, ship, vehicle etc)
Human Performance Enhancement
Information Advantage</li>
  <li>Assured Capability. Robust capabilities that assure operations in contested environments such as:
Power Generation and Management
Robotics and Autonomous Systems
Assured Positional Navigation Timing Systems</li>
</ul>

<p>For both tracks innovations must be fairly mature at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-terms-and-conditions-and-contract-guidance#what-dasa-funds">TRL 6 and above</a> to ensure that the solution can be commercialised within the time scale of the Innovation Loan. Applications must clearly evidence a Defence need for the innovative solution.</p>

<p>Supplier proposals must include evidence of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a high quality later-stage R&amp;D project with viable opportunity for growth</li>
  <li>a suitable team, with strong management and delivery approach to the project</li>
  <li>a strong defence requirement for the capability</li>
  <li>a clear route to commercial success and focus on growth or scale up</li>
  <li>a plan to cover interest payments on a quarterly basis</li>
  <li>a plan to repay the loan within 7 years of contract award</li>
  <li>why public funding is required in order to be able to carry out the project</li>
  <li>an explanation of why you are unable to fund the project from your own resources or other forms of private-sector funding</li>
  <li>clear evidence of development of a new and innovative product, process or service which can provide a step change in capability when compared to current capabilities</li>
  <li>a clear, evidence-based plan to deliver significant economic impact, return on investment (ROI) and growth through commercialisation, as soon as possible after project completion</li>
  <li>a project plan which adheres to the terms of the loan (i.e. Projects can last up to 4 years, of which up to 2 years can focus on late-stage R&amp;D and up to 2 more years can be spent establishing a clear route to commercial success)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What are we NOT looking for?</h2>
<p>For this category we are not interested in proposals that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have not shown a strong Defence requirement and capability need</li>
  <li>are from companies unable to afford the interest and repayments on the loan</li>
  <li>do not provide an appropriate and evidenced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://innovateuk.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HSRU1dB0E2wg8S" rel="external">Innovation Loan request</a>
</li>
  <li>have not shown a clear route to commercial success with potential to make a significant and positive impact on UK Defence</li>
  <li>ask for a loan of less than £250,000 or greater than £1.6M</li>
  <li>are not highly innovative research and development projects</li>
  <li>are consultancy, paper-based studies, market surveys or literature reviews</li>
  <li>are Projects which purely conduct data science / analytics</li>
  <li>are PhD proposals</li>
  <li>are Projects that simply demonstrate or purchase existing equipment or off-the shelf products, without undertaking further development of technology or techniques to meet the challenges proposed (unless applied to this challenge in a novel way)</li>
  <li>are Projects that offer no viable long-term prospect of integration into defence capabilities</li>
  <li>are Projects which are already being developed elsewhere within UK defence</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What should be included in your proposal?</h2>
<p>There are two elements to the Defence Innovation Loan application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Innovation Proposal – submitted through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/defence-and-security-accelerator-submit-your-research-proposal">DASA submission service</a>.</li>

<p>A project plan with clear milestones and staged drawdowns (deliverables). Milestones must be well defined and designed to provide evidence of progress against the project plan; Drawdowns will be subject to project progress, Innovate UK monitoring officer sign-off and financial and reporting covenants being met. Your proposal must demonstrate how you will complete all activities/services within the timescales.</p>

<h4>Resourcing Plan</h4>
<p>A resourcing plan must also be provided that identifies proposed staff that you intend to work on the project.</p>

<h4>Ethical, Legal and Regulatory Factors</h4>
<p>You must identify any ethical, legal and regulatory factors within your proposal and how the associated risks will be managed, including break points in the project if approvals are not received. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ministry-of-defence-research-ethics-committees">MOD Research and Ethics Committee (MODREC)</a> approvals can take up to 5 months therefore you should plan your work programme accordingly. If you are unsure if your proposal will need to apply for MODREC approval, then please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-ethical-legal-and-regulatory-guidance">DASA’s ethical legal and regulatory guidance</a> and / or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">contact DASA</a> for guidance.</p>

<h4>Government Furnished Assets (GFA)</h4>
<p>You should identify any incidences where you are in receipt of GFA (including examples) for the work you are expecting to carry out under the terms of the loan.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Innovation Loan Request</h3>
<p>In order to enable Innovate UK to consider your suitability for an Innovation Loan you must provide further business and financial information. The following paragraphs outline the key information that should be included in your business and financial submission to enable Innovate UK to make a full evaluation.</p>

<h4>Business Information</h4>
<p>You must provide us with information about your business by answering questions in the form of an online survey. These questions will cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business overview</li>
  <li>Loan request</li>
  <li>People / company structure</li>
  <li>Commercial activity</li>
  <li>Product development</li>
  <li>Finance and fundraising</li>
  <li>Growth challenges</li>
</ul>

<h4>Financial information</h4>
<p>You must provide us with financial information by completing a financial submission spreadsheet and uploading it at the end of the survey. The financial information required includes historic and forecast information to cover the full period of the loan for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profit and Loss</li>
  <li>Balance Sheet</li>
  <li>Cashflows</li>
</ul>

<h4>Financial commitment</h4>
<p>Entering into a loan agreement with Innovate UK Loans Ltd is a financial commitment. You need to confirm to Innovate UK that the loan is for business purposes. You are wholly responsible for ensuring that it is the right approach to financing your business, that your business is legally allowed to borrow and you will be able to fulfil the repayment obligations under the loan. You should take expert advice before submitting an application. By submitting an application, you are providing authority for Innovate UK (and any subsidiary or agency appointed to assess your application) to do checks on the financial standing of your business. This might include, but will not be limited to, checks with credit reference agencies (which might be recorded on your record) to determine your credit standing, identity, beneficial ownership and control, and source of existing funds.</p>

<p>Failure to provide any of the above listed will automatically render your proposal non-compliant and it will be pre-sifted out prior to assessment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Public facing information</h2>
<p>When submitting your proposal, you will be required to include a proposal title and a short abstract. The title and abstract you provide will be used by DASA, and other government departments, to describe the project and its intended outcomes and benefits. It will be used for inclusion at DASA events and included in documentation such as brochures. The proposal title will also be published in the DASA transparency data, along with your company name, the amount of funding, and the start and end dates of your innovation loan contract.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Subsidy Control and State Aid</h2>
<p>This competition provides funding in line with the UK’s obligations and commitments to Subsidy Control. Further information about the UK Subsidy Control requirements can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukeu-and-eaec-trade-and-cooperation-agreement-ts-no82021">EU-UK Trade and Cooperation agreement</a> and the subsequent guidance from the Department of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities">Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS)</a>.</p>

<p>You could get a loan of up to 100% of your eligible project costs. Since the loan will have favourable terms (particularly a below-market rate of interest) the value of this benefit over the life of the loan will be the equivalent of a grant. The gross grant equivalent will be the present value, at the date of commitment of the loan, of the difference between the market cost of interest and fees of a similar loan (using reference rates for interest) and the cost of an innovation loan. For <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovation-apply-for-a-funding-award#categories-of-research-and-development">experimental development projects</a> this grant equivalent, as a proportion of the eligible project costs, can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 45% if you are a micro or small business</li>
  <li>up to 35% if you are a medium-sized business</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect that most innovation loans will meet this requirement. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/guidance-for-specific-funds/innovation-loans/costs-we-fund/" rel="external">general guidance on innovation loans</a> contains more information to explain the grant equivalent calculation for an innovation loan.</p>

<p>Innovate UK is unable to award funding to organisations that are considered to be in financial difficulty. They will conduct financial viability and eligibility tests to confirm this is not the case as part of the credit evaluation of applications.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>European Commission State aid</h2>
<p>You must apply under European Commission State aid rules if you are an applicant who is conducting activities that will affect trade of goods and electricity between Northern Ireland and the EU as envisaged by Article 10 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU Withdrawal Agreement.</p>

<p>In certain limited circumstances, the European Commission State aid rules may also apply if you are an organisation located in England, Wales, or Scotland and conduct activities that affect the trade of goods and electricity between Northern Ireland and the EU. For further information, please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities">section 7 of the BEIS technical guidance</a>.</p>

<p>For further information see Innovate UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/general-guidance/funding-rules/" rel="external">general guidance on state aid</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments#section7">BEIS guidance on the Northern Ireland Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>For applicants subject to the European Commission State aid rules, you will be required to prove that you were not an “Undertaking in Difficulty” on the date of 31 December 2019 if you became an UID between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2021. We will ask for evidence of this.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about your obligations under the UK Subsidy Control regime or the State aid rules, you should take independent legal advice. We are unable to advise on individual eligibility or legal obligations.</p>

<p>You must make sure at all times that the funding awarded to you is compliant with all current Subsidy Control legislation applicable in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>This aims to regulate any advantage granted by a public sector body which threatens to or actually distorts competition in the United Kingdom or any other country or countries.</p>

<p>If there are any changes to the above requirements that mean we need to change the terms of this competition, we will tell you as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Competition Process and Assessment</h2>
<p>Defence Innovation Loan proposals will be evaluated on the quality of your project proposal and the suitability of your business to receive an offer of a Defence Innovation Loan.</p>

<p>Your proposal will be subject to the full DASA competition process and assessed using the criteria as detailed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-and-security-accelerator-how-your-proposal-is-assessed">competition process and assessment page</a>.</p>

<p>Innovate UK will be carrying out the Defence Innovation Loan credit evaluation of this competition and you will enter into a loan agreement and security agreement with Innovate UK Loans Ltd. Innovate UK’s Credit Team will assess the suitability of your business to receive the Defence Innovation Loan using the information provided in the business and financial questionnaire, including your financial spreadsheet submission. Innovate UK may need further information to be able to offer you a Defence Innovation Loan, at which point they may contact you. Innovate UK may decide against offering a Defence Innovation Loan if the information you provide does not make an adequate case for your company’s suitability.</p>

<p>DASA reserves the right to disclose, on a confidential basis, any information it receives from you during the application and assessment period to any third party engaged by DASA for the specific purpose of evaluating or assisting DASA in the evaluation of your proposal. In providing such information you consent to such disclosure. Appropriate confidentiality agreements (e.g. Non-Disclosure Agreements) will be put in place between DASA and the third party.</p>

<span class="number">13. </span>Dates</h2>
<p>Defence Innovation Loans will be open for proposal submission all year round. As part of a DASA pilot running until 16 March 2022, proposals will be assessed shortly after they are submitted rather than having to wait until the cycle closes.

<p>This pilot will be under review and we may change the format of the Defence Innovation Loans when the pilot ends, e.g. returning to cycle based assessment periods. Until then, we will accept proposals to the pilot until 12:00 (GMT) on 16 March 2022.</p>
