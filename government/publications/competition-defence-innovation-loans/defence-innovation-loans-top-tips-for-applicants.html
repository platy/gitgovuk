<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Top Tips for Defence Innovation Loans Applications</h2>
<p>When preparing to submit your DASA application for the Defence Innovation Loan please consider the following points. Please note that this guidance focuses on the DASA proposal form, additional guidance on completing the Innovate UK application form can be found at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://innovateuk.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9HSRU1dB0E2wg8S" rel="external">start of the form</a>. Here are our top tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read the competition document. This contains all the information about what is in and out of scope for a competition plus any guidelines you need to follow.</li>
  <li>Ensure you are content with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/996418/IUK-230421-Innovation-Loans-Terms-and-Conditions-April-2021.pdf" rel="external">Terms and Conditions</a> as these are not negotiable.</li>
  <li>Please use the text boxes provided for each section of the proposal, don’t attach a PDF with your answers.</li>
  <li>You may find it helpful to have both the Innovate and DASA forms open at the same time as there will be an element of duplication.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the formatting of the form can look different when you review it. Don’t worry, we don’t have rules on font type, size, line spacing etc.</li>
  <li>Check your title and abstract. These need to be clear and concise, as they will attract Assessors in the right research areas.</li>
  <li>Select your Area of Specialism(s) with care as these help us select the right assessors for your proposal – you only have to select one, but consider selecting one for the technology and one targeted at End Users.</li>
  <li>Address all three assessment criteria: Desirable, Feasible and Viable. Take care to address all of the points in the question guidance, you may want to consider using sub-headings for additional clarity.</li>
  <li>Check whether your proposal may be subject to any relevant legislation or regulations (e.g. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ministry-of-defence-research-ethics-committees">MODREC</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-of-investigatory-powers-act-2000-ripa">RIPA</a> )</li>
  <li>Identify your Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Tell us the TRL of your technology and the predicted TRL at the end of the proposal. Remember that to be eligible for a loan your technology must be TRL 6 or above so you should be in a position to select ‘Minimum viable product (approximate technology readiness level 5-7)’ on the Innovate UK application form.</li>
  <li>To assist you to complete the ‘Desirable’ section of the application form, you may wish to consider some of the following resources: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mod-science-and-technology-strategy-2020">MOD’s Science and Technology Strategy</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/">Gov.uk website</a>, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/" rel="external">Royal Navy</a> official website,  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/" rel="external">Army</a> official website and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/" rel="external">Royal Air Force</a> official website, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/desider-magazine">Defence Equipment and Support magazine</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/insight-archive">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) Magazine</a> and current <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dstls-areas-of-work-programmes-and-project-portfolios">Dstl programmes</a>. You may also find it helpful to look at innovations which have been <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/accelerator-funded-contracts">funded previously</a> through various DASA competitions.</li>
  <li>Provide enough technical detail to enable assessors to establish the feasibility of your innovation. You should assume that Assessors will have at least degree level education in relevant subjects.</li>
  <li>You can add figures if you feel they assist; please name them Figure 1, 2 etc in the text and as the attached files (PNG, JPG, PDF only). Use figures sparingly as they detract from assessors reading the application. The same applies to journal papers which also often have copyright restrictions.</li>
  <li>Tell us about your Team and capabilities. Name Team members and explain what they are going to do and their expertise in a couple of sentences – don’t just give a job title (e.g. ‘Technician’). In the finance section, name each individual and remind the assessors of their role (e.g. Joe Bloggs (Technician)). If you need to hire someone that’s fine, you should list their job title (e.g. Unknown (Technician)). In the risk section mitigate for hiring people. Also explain what equipment and facilities you have for the project.</li>
  <li>Provide a clear project plan and include a Gantt chart as an attachment to show the stages of the work planned, duration of each stage, how they link together and any dependencies.</li>
  <li>Identify risks to completion at each stage and outline mitigation steps.</li>
  <li>Explain how the work will be progressed at the end of your project, remember we are interested in moving projects up the TRL scale to commercialisation. Include details of any end users you have already engaged with.</li>
  <li>Aim for an hour. Assessors have an hour and a half to read, think about, understand, mark and provide feedback. Read your proposal and think about it; if it takes you ten minutes to read through, it doesn’t contain enough information.</li>
  <li>Don’t leave it to the last minute. Please don’t wait until the last minute to try and submit your proposal, technical issues do occur and unfortunately we are unable to accept late submissions.</li>
  <li>Once you have submitted you cannot make any changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Financial Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Carefully consider proposed major equipment purchases, ensure Value for Money (VFM) and justify this resource. Could you use a Test House, or rent equipment instead?</li>
  <li>If you have a subcontractor make sure you justify their costs. For example, “Mouse Ltd (overheads subcontractor) = £100,000” or similar, is not sufficient.</li>
  <li>No conference attendance permitted. - please see Innovate UK’s site for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/innovate-uk-completing-your-application-project-costs-guidance/partner-finance-form-guidance">eligible costs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Innovate UK Business Financials</h3>
<p>On the business financials questions, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The financial information on the Innovate UK forms is key, a lot of it pre-populates once you have input some basic information so please follow the instructions.</li>
  <li>Take a look at the questions and prepare the information well in advance of the closing date.</li>
  <li>Seek financial and legal advice where appropriate.</li>
  <li>Submit ALL parts of the application.</li>
  <li>Cover the full loan period</li>
  <li>Balance the balance sheet</li>
  <li>Match cash in the balance sheet and cashflow</li>
  <li>Describe the assumptions in the financials</li>
  <li>Revenues – top down and bottom up, be realistic</li>
  <li>Costs – include all costs needed to deliver your ambitious growth plan</li>
  <li>Think about sensitivities and stress cases - delays do happen</li>
  <li>Revenues are rarely as high as forecast</li>
  <li>Costs are typically higher than expected</li>
  <li>Is the loan affordable?</li>
  <li>Do you have adequate capital?</li>
  <li>Will you have sufficient cash throughout?</li>
</ul>
