<h4>Q: If you have more than one innovation idea with an outline available, can both be discussed in one cycle or should each be done on separate cycles?</h4>

<p>We can only consider one Defence Innovation Loan per organisation per cycle so we advise that you prioritise the innovation with the most potential impact on defence and UK economy. If you are submitting a more mature project for a Defence Innovation Loan, you may submit a proposal for a project at a lower TRL to one of our funding competitions. You may submit one proposal per competition or open call cycle. You cannot simultaneously submit an application to fund the same innovation to both the Defence Innovation Loans and a funding competition.</p>

<h4>Q: How detailed do the forecast financial projections need to be? From past applications this has required forecast cashflow (relatively straightforward) but also required an integrated Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet data - much more time consuming requiring professional input hence cost.</h4>

<p>Innovate UK are looking for proof that you can repay your loan. Although they will not drill down into fine detail, they will need high level financial data and so will look at the organisation’s cash flow and Profit/Loss and Balance Sheet data. We want you to be sure that you can demonstrate to your own business (including for example your Board and your shareholders), as well as to us, that a loan is suitable for you. We recommend watching Innovate UK’s video on the application process:</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://youtu.be/IS4lpuYrCSo" rel="external">video</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Q: The interest rate doesn’t seem that attractive. Might that be improved?</h4>

<p>The interest rate for Defence Innovation Loans is aligned to Innovate UK’s Innovation Loans and there are no plans to lower the rate at this stage.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that Defence Innovation Loans are aimed at organisations who are unable to obtain traditional funding from banks due to the higher level of risk (due to lack of revenue or security ), so this is not an appropriate like-for-like comparison. The risk level is reflected in the interest rate which is still below that current market interest rate. We believe that, where debt finance is available for late stage highly innovative R&amp;D projects from relatively early-stage SMEs, the rates available from commercial lenders (for example in venture debt facilities) is likely to be higher than our rate of 7.4%. More information on this can be found in Innovate UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovation-loans-general-guidance-for-applicants">general guidance for applicants</a>.</p>

<h4>Q: Do you have a sense of the input (number of hours) required from applicants throughout the whole application cycle?</h4>

<p>This will depend on how detailed your application is. DASA assessors have 90 minutes to read and assess your innovation proposals so providing the right level of information is key. We do not place a word limit on proposal submissions, but typically, applications are 10-15 pages long including diagrams. Please remember that you do not have to complete your application in one go, you can save your progress and pick it back up later.</p>

<h4>Q: Are Defence Innovation Loans only available for projects at a higher TRL?</h4>

<p>Defence Innovation Loans were designed to help mature innovations become market-ready and as such are exclusively for projects at TRL 6 or above. Project at lower TRLs are eligible for funding through DASA Themed and Open Calls.</p>

<h4>Q: Are you able to connect applicants with potential end-users?</h4>

<p>We do not put applicants in direct contact with end users. However, DASA employs a network of regional Innovation Partners who will talk with you about your idea and can provide help and guidance. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-a-dasa-innovation-partner">Contact your local Innovation Partner</a></p>

<h4>Q: The total available budget for Defence Innovation Loans is £10 million, is this per cycle or per year? Is it possible that all of the loans will be allocated in the first round and no budget will be available on subsequent rounds?</h4>

<p>The £10 million budget is for the whole of FY21/22. We cannot predict when the budget will be used up as we do not know how many applications we are likely to receive in the first few cycles. We are working on obtaining additional funding to increase the total budget however we highly recommend submitting your application as soon as you are ready. It is equally important to submit a comprehensive application so please make sure you have covered all the questions</p>

<h4>Q: If, as an organisation, you do not typically build the equipment, but after having proven the technology have found a manufacturer, will these costs be covered?</h4>

<p>Full details of what costs are eligible can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/innovate-uk-completing-your-application-project-costs-guidance/partner-finance-form-guidance">Innovate UK website</a>.</p>

<p>Defence Innovations Loans are available to cover your production costs, so if you are subcontracting to a company to manufacture your product, the costs may be eligible. If, on the other hand, you are licensing or selling your product to a manufacturer, the costs will not be eligible.</p>

<h4>Q: Will feedback be supplied on all applications even if rejected?</h4>

<p>Feedback will be provided to all unsuccessful applicants. DASA will provide feedback on the innovation quality of the project and Innovate UK will comment on the business and financial application.</p>

<p>There are three stages which your application will go through</p>

<p>Stage 1 – Following closure of the competition, your application will go through a high level eligibility check. If your application fails at this stage, for example it doesn’t meet the defence need or you have not provided your financial information; you will be advised of the reason.</p>

<p>Stage 2 – If you are successful in moving to Stage 2, the project part of the application will go through assessment with DASA selected Assessors and the business and financial application will go through a credit triage through Innovate UK. If you are unsuccessful at this point, both DASA and Innovate UK will give feedback so that you know why. You will also have access to the Assessor comments through your IFS account.</p>

<p>Stage 3 – This is where successful applications will go through the full credit analysis through Innovate UK. Once again at the end of this process, the Innovate UK Credit Specialist working on your application will provide feedback from their credit committee for the reasons for the application being unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The feedback provided will be simple but will advise you of the key reasons for the loan not being approved.</p>

<h4>Q: Can you resubmit if rejected?</h4>

<p>You may be able to resubmit dependent on the reason why your application was rejected but this will have to be into a future round.</p>

<p>If you submit your application early, Innovate UK may have the opportunity to do a quick high level review of your financial spreadsheet. Any incomplete spreadsheets will be returned to you and you will have a chance to improve and resubmit before the final submission deadline. If you submit right on the deadline and it’s not adequate, it’s likely that the application will be declined or ruled ineligible and then any resubmission would have to be into a future round.</p>

<p>DASA are also trying to keep an eye on applications and that’s why they are encouraging applicants to speak to them to make sure their project is eligible. Like above, if the application comes in on the deadline and information is missing, the application could be declined.</p>

<h4>Q: Do you anticipate that there will be future rounds of innovation loan funding available?</h4>

<p>It’s very much dependent on the volume of applications we get for this cycle and the successful applications from the previous cycle.</p>

<p>We have a total of £10 million for this financial year, split into the £5 million for defence in general and £5 million specifically for the Army. If those funds are used up within the financial year, then it may be that there’s a delay with the next cycle. We would recommend that if you feel your business is at the right stage and has a need for the loan, then do not delay in applying because we don’t know when those funds will run out. However, don’t rush your application just because you want to get it in before that deadline. Without complete information there is the likelihood of it being rejected.</p>

<p>We are looking at securing future rounds of funding and will announce these when they are confirmed.</p>

<h4>Q: Are there any benefits to submitting to DASA rather than Innovate UK?</h4>

<p>This will depend upon your project requirements and the availability of funding through DASA and Innovate UK. 
DASA’s focus is on Defence &amp; Security whereas Innovate UK has a much broader portfolio.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning the additional support available - The DASA Access to Mentoring and Finance team and our wider Exploitation team help support businesses, bring ideas through to commercialisation and where applicable, will liaise with the end users and give specific help and support. In addition, we would refer you to Innovate UK EDGE if that was a more appropriate route for support. So, it’s worth pointing out the overall package, not just the ability to get funding.</p>

<h4>Q: You mention the requirement of a mortgage debenture by way of a fixed and floating charge on the assets of the business. Are you prepared to take a second charge as we, in common with many businesses, have given a first charge to our bank for existing debt finance?</h4>

<p>As security Innovate UK do take a Mortgage Debenture which is a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the business. However, we recognise that you may already have or may need senior secured commercial debt in the future and Innovate UK will be prepared to enter into a deed of priority and it would be our expectation that we would sit behind an existing or future senior commercial lender. We wouldn’t be prepared to sit behind a junior lender, or a shareholder or director or anything other than a senior commercial lender.</p>

<p>We do not ask for personal guarantees.</p>

<h4>Q: What success rate do you expect based on previous experience?</h4>

<p>At the moment we do not know what the success rate will be for Defence Innovation Loans because we are still working through the first cycle of applications.</p>

<p>In terms of Innovation Loans overall, Innovate UK have been operating them as a pilot since the first competition launched in November 2017. Following a number of pilot competitions, we ran innovation continuity loans competitions specifically as part of Innovate UKs Coronavirus support package to innovative businesses and during the whole of that period we’ve had a success rate of about 20%. We have had about 1000 applications and have about 200 loans in our portfolio.</p>

<p>The reasons for success, or lack of success, have been a combination of not meeting the required level of innovation quality around their project and/or not being suitable from a lending point of view. What we have often found is that those applications that are not considered by our independent assessors to be of a sufficiently high quality from an innovation project point of view, very often tend to be the same applications that have not been considered to be suitable from a lending point of view by our credit committee. That’s not 100% correlation, there have been some very high scoring applications but the Credit Team did not feel were unsuitable for a loan.</p>

<p>There have been other applications that looked perfectly suitable from a lending point of view from an initial review but which had a very low innovation score. But there has certainly been a correlation in terms of quality of innovation and quality of financials. Overall, so far, our success rate has been about 20%.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that it is a loan to bring forward innovation, so we are not just making a purely commercial decision on the loans, so your application has got to score highly on both parts of the application.</p>

<h4>Q: Can you submit for both an open call and the loan?</h4>

<p>These are two separate things. A company could apply for a Defence Innovation loan and also apply for an open call funding, but it’s likely to be for two separate projects. The Defence Innovation Loans are for much more mature products or ideas, whilst typically open call would be expecting to finish at about the same level as a Defence Innovation Loan would start.</p>

<p>You would be able to apply for both in parallel but they are two different processes.</p>

<h4>Q: I am presently the only director. Does that rule out a successful application?</h4>

<p>No, it doesn’t rule it out. A business with a single director is probably what we would consider to be one of a number of amber flags, and a single amber flag on its own wouldn’t rule something out. 
I would encourage you to think that your business needs to be more than a one-person business. Having a diverse board of directors is valuable. They can bring in their capabilities, connections, and contacts, as well as from a governance and a business capability point of view – I’d really encourage you to think about that. We think that’s really important.
If you don’t have it right now when you submit your application, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but you must show us what your plan is over a period of time to address that challenge.</p>

<h4>Q: We have an Innovate Business Continuity loan in year one of the availability period. Does this exclude us from this loan?</h4>

<p>No. We have got some businesses in our portfolio that have more than one loan. We would obviously take into account the existing indebtedness as well as the future forecast when looking at suitability. We’ve done it before.</p>

<h4>Q: How is a micro SME pre-revenue able to meet a liquidity ratio of 1.1?</h4>

<p>That would be accomplished by having enough cash in the business, which is normally given by having sufficient capital in the business. The cash, which is part of the business’s current assets, would therefore exceed the current liabilities, and that’s the definition of liquidity.</p>

<p>As a result, being pre-revenue may imply that there is no source of cash income from customers, but there may be cash in the business as a result of having raised equity. That would be a common manner of demonstrating the liquidity ratio of 1.1.</p>

<h4>Q: Re. timings on investment and liquidity calculation - would something like a term sheet from an investor be sufficient to indicate imminent presence of funds?</h4>

<p>Yes, I believe that if you had a term sheet from an investor, which provides you with an estimate of the expected time and amount of capital raising to include in your cash flow forecast, it would be a better starting point than if you have a plan but no term sheet. For a full credit analysis and potentially in a conditional loan offer, what we want to get from term sheets is ‘ is this really going to happen’.</p>

<p>But certainly if you have a term sheet, that’s valuable evidence of your funding plan, and how you’re going to implement that.</p>

<h4>Q: How are you defining and evaluating degrees of ‘innovation’?</h4>

<p>What we’re looking for is something that is not just a simple step change, but is as
disruptive or transformational as possible. If you are not highly innovative, you can still consider applying for an innovation loan, because it might be something that’s highly desirable to the end-user. But we would prefer something that is also disruptive and innovative.</p>

<p>So you’ve got to consider how much you are going to be moving the innovation forward. So yes, we are after transformational and disruptive innovation, but it’s got to be something that an expert in your field will look at and say, that could work.</p>

<h4>Q: On feasibility: can you talk a little about the assessors’ technical knowledge and the level of technical detail expected in the application?</h4>

<p>They need to be able to understand what testing you’ve done so far, and that may mean showing that you’ve got prototypes, or the equivalent for the stage that you’re at. Yes, you can include technical information; it’s the same sort of assessment we would do in an open call. As part of it, you’d give the technology areas that your work comes under, and we make sure that we match up the technology areas with the assessors.</p>

<p>Do state the correct key words for your area, such that an expert is likely to recognise that it is part of their area. We have got a wide range of technical experts; however if you’ve got a very new area, then it might be slightly more difficult for us.</p>

<h4>Q: How do we link up the assessors with our government exploitation partners (i.e. the end users)?</h4>

<p>Our assessors will be end users if we can help it. If you have already got end users in mind who you are working with, then we will be interested to know who they are, so that we would be able to work with them and perhaps make them our assessors.</p>

<p>On desirability, we’re going to the end users and asking them if the innovation is something that they would like to see coming through that would be of use to them. On the technical side, we’re also making sure that we’ve got technical experts engaged, and that we’ve got a mix of assessors across the range.</p>

<h4>Q: How much of the fund has already been used?</h4>

<p>Good question, and there isn’t a definitive answer on that, because we’ve got loans at various stages. Some have already been agreed and waiting to be drawn down, some are in the assessment period, and if they’re successful they will take up part of the pot. But don’t let this put you off applying.</p>

<p>We do have plenty of funds available, and we’ve got them committed for future financial years as well. It’s likely that for the applications that come in now, by the time that those loans draw, we will be into the next financial year. So that’s not something that an applicant probably needs to consider.</p>

<h4>Q: If you make a small mistake on your spreadsheet is the whole application thrown out?</h4>

<p>Not for a small mistake. The way we have looked at this in the past is that when an application is submitted, we will look at that financials spreadsheet, and if it’s not been completed or if there are massive gaps, then we would consider the application not to be eligible from a financial point of view. As we’ve said, we expect to see balance sheet, profit and loss, and cash flow forecast for the past three years if available, or less if the company has been incorporated more recently, and for the full period of the innovation loan. If an applicant has not provided financials for the full period of the loan and only provided, for example a three year forecast, but have asked for a seven-year loan, then that’s inadequate.</p>

<p>As we’ve said, we expect to see the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow estimate for the previous three years. If there’s a minor error, it’ll be taken into account during the initial credit check, and it’s possible that we’ll look at it and conclude that there are some concerns with those financials. Those could be regarded material, in which case a rejection is possible, or they could be questions that we’d like to look deeper into and discuss with the applicant.</p>

<p>If we go then to detailed credit analysis, if the project is highly innovative, and meeting the Defence Innovation Loan needs of DASA, then that’s where that idea of marginal comes in.</p>

<p>People frequently fail to include debtors and creditors in inventories. Please don’t do that; it makes it harder for us to consider liquidity, and it’s also incorrect from the standpoint of your company. Although a candy shop may function on cash, most businesses do not, so keep that in mind as you plan ahead.</p>

<p>The other area where applicants often give us fundamental issues is around the capitalisation side of things - where businesses haven’t included capital raises that are fundamental for the business - so I would encourage people to think very carefully about that.</p>

<h4>Q: Does the debenture cover IP assets?</h4>

<p>Yes. A mortgage debenture is security over the overall assets of the business, commonly referred to as the fixed and floating charge. So that’s all of the assets of the business; both tangible and intangible. We don’t individually list them all out in a debenture, but whatever those assets might be at the point at which that charge crystallises – i.e. if something goes horribly wrong, then it’s like a roundabout, and at that point the roundabout stops and all the assets that are in the business at that point would be the subject of the charge that crystallises. That would then be the security that we would seek to enforce at that point, if we needed to in order to seek repayment of the loan.</p>

<h4>Q: Is the 3.7% deferred interest capitalised?</h4>

<p>Both yes and no. We will charge 7.4 percent interest during the availability and extension periods; 3.7 percent will be payable that quarter, and 3.7 percent will be postponed, not compounded (and so not capitalised), but added to the capital amount for the payback period. As a result, it will be capitalised at that time.</p>
