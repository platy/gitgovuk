<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The temporary provisions in the Coronavirus Act 2020 expired on 24 March 2022. As a result the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3872468" rel="external">Remote Education (England) Temporary Continuity (No.2) direction</a> no longer has effect.</p>

<p>This document provides non-statutory guidance to schools on maintaining their capabilities to deliver high quality remote education in cases where it is not possible or contrary to government guidance for some or all pupils to attend face-to-face education.</p>

<p>The priority should always be for schools to deliver high-quality face-to-face education to all pupils. Remote education should only ever be considered as a short-term measure and as a last resort where in person attendance is not possible.</p>

<p>This guidance is effective from 29 March 2022.</p>

<h2>Scenarios where remote education should be provided</h2>

<p>Attendance is mandatory for all pupils of compulsory school age. Schools should consider providing remote education to pupils in circumstances when in-person attendance is either not possible or contrary to government guidance.</p>

<p>This might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>occasions when school leaders decide that it is not possible for their setting to open safely, or that opening would contradict guidance from local or central government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>occasions when individual pupils, for a limited duration, are unable to physically attend their school but are able to continue learning, for example pupils with an infectious illness</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In these circumstances pupils should have access to remote education as soon as reasonably practicable, though in proportion to the length of absence and disruption to their learning.</p>

<p>Where needed, you should consider providing remote education equivalent in length to the core teaching pupils would receive in school and including recorded or live direct teaching time, as well as time for pupils to complete tasks and assignments independently.</p>

<p>Good practice is considered to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 hours a day on average across the cohort for key stage 1, with less for younger children</li>
  <li>4 hours a day for key stage 2</li>
  <li>5 hours a day for key stages 3 and 4</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to provide</h3>

<p>Online video lessons do not necessarily need to be recorded by teaching staff at the school. High quality lessons developed by external providers can be provided instead of school led video content.</p>

<p>Schools will already have remote education plans in place that have worked for them when face-face education has not been possible. You can continue to use established remote education plans with which staff, pupils and parents and carers are familiar.</p>

<p>Those requiring further guidance to develop remote education provision should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where applicable, continuing to use the digital platform for remote education provision that has been used consistently across the school to allow interaction, assessment and feedback and make sure staff continue to be trained and confident in its use</li>
  <li>continuing to overcome barriers to digital access where possible for pupils by, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>distributing school-owned laptops accompanied by a user agreement or contract if possible</li>
      <li>securing appropriate internet connectivity solutions where possible</li>
      <li>providing printed resources, such as textbooks and workbooks, to structure learning, supplemented with other forms of communication to keep pupils on track or answer questions about work</li>
      <li>having systems for checking, daily, whether pupils learning remotely are engaging with their work, and work with families to rapidly identify effective solutions where engagement is a concern</li>
      <li>identifying a named senior leader with overarching responsibility for the quality and delivery of remote education if schools feel this will be useful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When teaching pupils remotely, schools should continue to consider how to transfer into remote education what we already know about effective teaching in the live classroom. This should include opportunities for regular feedback and interaction with teachers and peers during the school day.</p>

<p>Schools should consider this guidance in relation to the pupil’s age, stage of development or special educational needs, for example where this would place significant demands on parents’ help or support. For example, children in key stage 1 or reception often require high levels of parental involvement to support their engagement with remote education, which can make digital remote education provision a particular challenge for this age group.</p>

<h3>Provision for pupils with SEND</h3>

<p>If pupils with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) are not able to be in school and require remote education their teachers are best placed to know how the pupil’s needs can be most effectively met to ensure they continue to make progress.</p>

<p>We recognise that some pupils with SEND may not be able to access remote education without adult support. Schools should work collaboratively with families and put in place reasonable adjustments so that pupils with SEND can successfully access remote education. In this situation, decisions on how provision can be delivered should be informed by relevant considerations including the support families will require and types of services that the pupil can access remotely.</p>

<p>The requirement within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/contents/enacted" rel="external">2014 Children and Families Act</a> for schools to use their best endeavours to secure the special educational provision called for by the pupils’ special educational needs remains in place.</p>

<h3>Publishing information about remote provision</h3>

<p>To provide clarity and transparency to pupils and parents or carers about what to expect from remote education if it is required, schools may wish to continue to publish information about their remote education provision on their websites.</p>

<h2>Delivering remote education safely</h2>

<p>Keeping children safe online is essential. The guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safeguarding-and-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19">safeguarding and remote education</a> provides the information on what education settings should be doing to protect your pupils and students online. The guidance includes a collection of resources which includes support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>safe remote education</li>
  <li>virtual lessons</li>
  <li>live streaming</li>
  <li>information to share with parents and carers to support them in keeping their children safe online</li>
</ul>

<p>For schools delivering their remote education through live and recorded lessons, the following support is available through third-party resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://swgfl.org.uk/resources/safe-remote-learning/" rel="external">Safe Remote Learning knowledge base</a> by South West Grid for Learning (SWGfL)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://swgfl.org.uk/magazine/camera-s-on-or-off-and-other-important-questions-answered-by-the-posh-helpline/" rel="external">live remote lessons</a> – SWGfL article answering questions asked of the Professional Online Safety Helpline addressing key concerns from teachers</li>
  <li>National Cyber Security Centre, which includes information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-security-guidance-organisations" rel="external">which video conference service is right for you</a> and using video conferencing services securely</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting help to deliver remote education</h2>

<p>Peer-to-peer advice and training is available through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-help-with-tech.education.gov.uk/EdTech-demonstrator-programme" rel="external">EdTech Demonstrator programme</a>.</p>

<h2>Recording in the attendance register</h2>

<p>Schools should continue referring to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-attendance">school attendance guidance</a>. They should continue to keep a record of, and monitor pupils’ engagement with remote education, but this does not need to be tracked in the attendance register.</p>
