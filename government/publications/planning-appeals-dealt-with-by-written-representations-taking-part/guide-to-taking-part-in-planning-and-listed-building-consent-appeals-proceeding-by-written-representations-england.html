<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1 This guide explains how, if you are interested in the outcome of an appeal, you can make your views known.</p>

<p>1.2 Please note – there are separate guides for appeals that are proceeding by the hearing or inquiry process. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate">access all our appeal guides through GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>1.3 This guide does not apply to any appeal in connection with a householder application, an application for express consent to display an advertisement which has been refused or an application for minor commercial (shop front) development which has been refused which is proceeding by the written representations procedure. For further information please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a> in particular paragraph 1.5 and Annexe C: “Householder, advertisement and minor commercial appeals”.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Who decides an appeal and what are the rules?</h2>

<p>2.1 Planning and listed building consent applications are made to the local planning authority (LPA) which will usually be the local council but may be a National Park Authority. Appeals are made to us and may be made for a number of reasons, but most are made because the LPA has refused planning permission or consent.</p>

<p>2.2 Nearly all appeals are decided by our Inspectors, a very small percentage are decided by the Secretary of State - these tend to be the very large or contentious proposals.</p>

<p>2.3 Appeals made under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 which are proceeding by the written procedure follow:</p>

<p>The Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2009/452 Part 2 as amended by The Town and Country Planning (Appeals) (Written Representations Procedure and Advertisements) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 Statutory Instrument 2013/2114</p>

<p>and appeals about listed building consent follow the spirit of these regulations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>How you find out about the appeal</h2>

<p>3.1 After we have accepted the appeal as valid the LPA should notify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any person who was notified or consulted about the application;
and</li>
  <li>any other person who made representations about the application;</li>
</ul>

<p>that the appeal has been made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>The written procedure</h2>

<p>4.1 Most planning appeals are decided by the written representations procedure. With this procedure the Inspector considers written evidence from the appellant, the LPA and anyone else who, like you, has an interest in the appeal. The site is also likely to be visited.</p>

<p>4.2 The Business and Planning Act 2020 provides greater flexibility, allowing appeal procedures (the written procedure, hearing or inquiry) to be combined. Appeals proceeding by the written representations route will not normally be combined with other procedures and will follow the written representations procedure in most cases.</p>

<p>4.3 At the Annexe of this guide there is a timetable for planning appeals:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>What you can do</h2>

<p>5.1 The LPA will send us copies of any letters of support or objection it received about the application while considering it. These will be fully considered by the Inspector who decides the appeal.</p>

<p>5.2 If you did not write at application stage, or you did write and now have something new to say, you can send us your representations about the appeal.</p>

<p>5.3 You should be able to see copies of the appeal documents, including the appellant’s representations – their grounds of appeal or full statement of case – at the LPA’s offices before the deadline for you to make your representations.</p>

<p>5.4 The time limit given in the regulations for sending representations to us is important, and everyone taking part in an appeal must follow it. <strong>If you send us representations after the end of the time limit, we will not normally accept them. Instead we will return them to you. This means that the Inspector will not see them and so will not be able to take them into account.</strong></p>

<p>5.5 So you <strong>must</strong> make sure that we receive your representations within the deadline given by the LPA when it notified you of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.6 When you send us your representations you should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name and address;</li>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate appeal reference number (this will
start APP/…);</li>
  <li>the address of the appeal site;</li>
</ul>

<p>and say either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘I am against the appeal proposals’ and explain whether it is for the same reasons as given by the LPA or, if not, explain your own reasons; or</li>
  <li>‘I support the appeal proposals’ and explain why.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.7 You can make your representations online through GOV.UK using the <a class="govuk-link" href="/appeal-planning-inspectorate">search facility</a> or you can write to or email us. The LPA should have told you our Case Officer’s contact details. Our Case Officer is responsible for the administration of the appeal.</p>

<p>5.8 If you send us your representations in a letter, unless your handwriting is very clear it would help if you are able to have your representations typed. Please use <strong>black</strong> ink. Please note that we do not acknowledge receipt.</p>

<p>5.9 We will copy your representations to the appellant, to any statutory parties and to the LPA (we refer to these as “the main parties”) where they will be available for anyone to see them.</p>

<p>5.10 However, if we consider that your representations contain inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, we will send them back to you before the Inspector or anyone else sees them. If you take out the inflammatory, discriminatory or abusive comments, you can send your representations back to us; <strong>but</strong> you must send them back before the time limit ends.</p>

<p>5.11 We do not accept anonymous representations, but you may ask for your name and address to be withheld. If you ask us to do this you should make sure that your representations do not include any other information which may identify you. We will copy your representations, with your name and address removed, to the main parties, and they will be seen by the Inspector who may give them less weight as a result.</p>

<p>5.12 If you indicate that you do not want us to copy your representations to the main parties, we will return them. They will not be seen by the Inspector and, therefore, will not be taken into account. This is because the Inspector can only take into account representations which have been copied to the main parties and are available to be seen.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>What is considered?</h2>

<p>6.1 The Inspector can only take into account information and evidence that is relevant to the appeal. This could cover a wide range of issues, but those that apply are usually set out in the LPA’s decision notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>If you decide to send documents to support your representations</h2>

<p>7.1 Please note that we are unable to return any documents or photographs.</p>

<p>7.2 Please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a font such as Arial or Verdana in a size of 11 point or larger;</li>
  <li>use <strong>A4</strong> paper wherever possible;</li>
  <li>number the pages of the documents;</li>
  <li>make sure photocopied and scanned documents are clear and legible;</li>
  <li>use black and white for documents unless colour is essential;</li>
  <li>put any photographs (both originals and photocopies should be in colour), maps, plans, etc, in a <strong>separate appendix</strong> and cross- reference them within the main body of the document;</li>
  <li>print documents on both sides of a page. You should use paper of good enough quality that something printed on one side of the page does not show through to the other side;</li>
  <li>ensure that the scale and orientation of any maps and plans are shown clearly. If you are sending maps or plans by email or through GOV.UK you <strong>must</strong> tell us the paper size;</li>
  <li>do not send original documents unless we specifically ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>7.3 Please see Annexe I: “Communicating electronically with us” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a> for additional guidance about sending us documents through GOV.UK or by email:</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Audio/video evidence</h2>

<p>8.1 We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>8.2 However, you may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, the appellant and the LPA. Please send this within the 5 week deadline for representations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>The site visit</h2>

<p>9.1 The Inspector or his/her representative will normally visit the appeal site before a decision is made. If enough of the site can be seen from the road or a public viewpoint, the Inspector will view the site without anyone else being present.</p>

<p>9.2 Where necessary appellants will be required to provide the Inspector or his/her representative with access to the appeal site. The appellant’s or agent’s presence at the appeal site will be required solely to provide access to the site. On occasions both the appellant and the LPA’s representative will need to be present during the site visit. This is most likely to be the case where site measurements are in dispute or where it is anticipated that those present will need to point out physical features that they have referred to in their written evidence.</p>

<p>9.3 Although it may be appropriate on some occasions there is normally no need for other people to attend the site visit. However, if you own a property nearby and consider that the appeal site needs to be viewed from your property, you should tell us this when you write to us. If we decide the Inspector might need to see the appeal site from your property we will let you know the date and time/time slot of the appeal site visit.</p>

<p>9.4 At the appeal site visit, the Inspector or his/her representative will decide if it is necessary to view the site from your property. If so, he/she will visit your property and you will be required solely to provide access. Where both the appellant and an LPA representative (and, where appropriate, any interested person) were present at the appeal site visit they will accompany the Inspector or his/her representative during the visit to your property.</p>

<p>9.5 As everyone concerned with the appeal has to make their case in writing only, no discussion is allowed about the appeal during a site visit. The Inspector or his/her representative will be there purely to assess the effect of the proposed development on the surroundings. However, where accompanied by the appellant and the LPA representative (and where appropriate, any interested person) the Inspector or his/her representative may ask factual questions to confirm his/her understanding of physical features of the site.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Application for appeal costs</h2>

<p>10.1 All parties to an appeal are normally expected to meet their own expenses.</p>

<p>10.2 There is <a class="govuk-link" href="http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/blog/guidance/appeals/" rel="external">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Communities and Local Government’s planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>10.3 It is important that you read this because it explains how, when and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>10.4 Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>The decision</h2>

<p>11.1 When made, the decision will be published on GOV.UK and can be viewed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="/appeal-planning-inspectorate">search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Feedback, complaints and challenges</h2>

<p>12.1 We welcome feedback about people’s experience of dealing with us. This can be provided to us at any time. Please send these to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">feedback@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>12.2 If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspector’s decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case it is dealt with by the Customer Quality Team who are independent of the teams who process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. Further information on our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a> is available on the GOV.UK website.</p>

<p>13.1 If you wish to complain about a decision made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal you should write to our Case Officer giving clear reasons why you think we should review our decision.</p>

<p>13.2 For decisions made by administrative staff during the processing of an appeal there is no statutory right to challenge that decision in the High Court. However it is possible to make an application for judicial review of such a decision. For further information please see Annexe L “How can a decision be challenged” ” of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/planning-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Planning appeals – England”</a>.</p>

<p>13.3 The application must be made not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose.</p>
