<h5>Please Note</h5>

<p>The OISC has established a relationship with Due Diligence Checking (DDC), a recognised umbrella body that will carry out DBS checks on our behalf, including the verification of ID process.</p>

<p>DDC carry out Standard Level DBS checks for the OISC. Please do not contact DDC before you have applied to the OISC and provided your consent to be contacted as they will be unable to assist you.</p>

<p>DDC will contact you after we have your consent to start the DBS application process. Your consent is requested in the New Adviser Application and Competence Statement link found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-adviser-application-and-competence-statement">here</a>.</p>

<p>DDC will take you through the necessary steps and provide all the support you may need in obtaining your DBS disclosure certificate.</p>

<p>The full cost for this process is £39.60; £18 for the DBS fee, £10 for document verification and an £8 admin fee, including VAT the full charge is £39.60. This is payable to DDC who will instruct you how to pay it once the process is started. If you are working as a volunteer for your organisation then you are exempt from the £18 DBS fee – please remember to inform us that you are a volunteer.</p>

<p>Once your certificate has been issued, you will receive your DBS certificate in the post within 2 weeks. DDC will inform us that your certificate has been issued, and unless there is content on the certificate, you do not need to do anything further. If DDC inform us that there is content on the DBS check, we will ask you to send us an electronic copy of the certificate. You should never send us your original DBS certificate.</p>
