<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General information about charges</h2>

<p>This section is about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the types of charges you need to pay</li>
  <li>whether the charges are fixed costs or charged on a time and materials basis</li>
  <li>who needs to pay for charges</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Application charges</h3>

<p>You will need to pay an application charge when you apply for a new permit. The application charge depends on your activity and the type of permit you have. It covers the work the Environment Agency carries out each time they assess (determine) a permit application.</p>

<p>Section 2 on permit application charges has more information about these charges and when you may need to pay extra.</p>

<p>If your application is successful, you may also have to pay to vary, transfer or surrender your permit. You can find more information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>varying a permit in section 3</li>
  <li>transferring a permit in section 4</li>
  <li>surrendering a permit in section 5</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Annual subsistence charge</h3>

<p>Whilst you have your permit, you will also need to pay an annual subsistence charge. This covers the costs of regulating an activity. For example, carrying out checks to make sure you are complying with the conditions in your permit.</p>

<p>Section 6 on subsistence charges has more information about these charges and when you may need to pay extra.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Types of charges</h3>

<p>Environment Agency application and subsistence charges are based on either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed charges</li>
  <li>time and materials charges</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency has fixed charges for most customer groups and activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Additional application and subsistence charges</h3>

<p>There are additional charges that some customers will need to pay on top of the fixed application and annual subsistence charges.</p>

<p>These additional charges will only apply if the Environment Agency needs to do extra or unusual regulatory work. This could either be when determining a permit application or after a permit has been issued (permit subsistence).</p>

<p>Charges for this extra work will either be a fixed cost or calculated on a time and materials basis.</p>

<p>You will pay a fixed cost additional charge when extra work is needed to support a permit application. For example, at some sites the Environment Agency will need to assess an odour management plan, or for intensive farming installations, a dust and bio-aerosols management plan.</p>

<p>Operators with a waste transfer or treatment permit will pay a fixed cost additional charge for the first year of operations.</p>

<p>You will pay time and materials additional charges when it is hard to predict the amount of work the Environment Agency will need to do. This is so the hourly costs of the officers and equipment involved can be recovered in full.</p>

<p>See section 1.5 to find out when time and materials additional charges will apply.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span> Time and materials charges</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency uses time and materials charging:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for sites of high public interest (section 2.5 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>for staged applications â where you submit your application information in stages (section 2.4 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>for discretionary services they can offer, for example enhanced pre-application advice (section 2.3 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>where they need to carry out extra (or unplanned) regulatory activities, for example after a pollution incident (section 6.5 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>where, after a permit has been issued, they need to carry out extra work to assess or approve information you have submitted to meet a permit condition, for example assessing a fire prevention plan (section 6.6 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>for specified radioactive substances activities (section 1.5.1 explains these charges)</li>
  <li>for the regulation (but not applications) relating to medium combustion plant</li>
  <li>for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for the purpose of recovering oil and gas</li>
</ul>

<p>For a time and materials approach, the Environment Agency judges how much work is needed to assess a permit application or regulate that activity. They will calculate what to charge you based on the appropriate hourly rate and then invoice you for that amount.</p>

<p>Environment Agency hourly rates reflect the costs of carrying out their activities. Staff will record the amount of time they have spent working on a project, or piece of work for a customer. The hourly rates also include an allowance for support staff and overheads.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>legal advice</li>
  <li>work by technical staff who do not time record for charging purposes</li>
  <li>accommodation</li>
  <li>IT support systems</li>
  <li>health and safety</li>
  <li>producing guidance</li>
  <li>financial services</li>
  <li>other support costs</li>
</ul>

<p>If you request a discretionary service that has a time and materials cost, for example enhanced pre-application advice, the Environment Agency will give you a written estimate. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a breakdown of the work they will carry out with costs</li>
  <li>when these costs will be charged (approximately)</li>
</ul>

<p>If they receive new information from you (or others) that means they need to revise their estimate, they will tell you. They will agree with you in writing any changes to the scope of work requested and to their cost estimate.</p>

<h4>1.5.1 Time and materials for specified radioactive substances activities</h4>

<p>A specified radioactive substances activity (<abbr title="specified radioactive substances activity">SRSA</abbr>) is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a radioactive substance activity carried out at a nuclear site</li>
  <li>accumulating or disposing of radioactive waste at a facility with a permit to accumulate and dispose of radioactive waste to land</li>
  <li>using radioactive material for generating electricity from fusion, including any associated research and development</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency uses time and materials charging for these <abbr title="specified radioactive substances activity">SRSA</abbr> permitting activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>applications</li>
  <li>variations</li>
  <li>transfers</li>
  <li>surrenders</li>
</ul>

<p>Subsistence charges for sites regulated by the Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency (<abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr>) are also calculated using time and materials charging. The Environment Agency will give operators a written estimate of the Environment Agency and <abbr title="Food Standards Agency">FSA</abbr> costs for each site.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency charges Â£286 an hour for key technical work carried out by specialist nuclear regulation staff. This rate includes an allowance for support work carried out by other staff.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency charges Â£125 an hour for other technical and support work carried out by technical staff who are not specialist nuclear regulators.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency recovers the costs of running their independent monitoring programmes for <abbr title="specified radioactive substances activities">SRSAs</abbr>.</p>

<p>They also recover the costs of meeting their international reporting obligations relating to the disposal of radioactive waste into the environment from <abbr title="specified radioactive substances activities">SRSAs</abbr>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Euratom Articles 35 and 36 monitoring and reporting</li>
  <li>work in support of Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPARCOM) reporting obligations</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency may also recover costs if they have to use contracted specialist technical staff to support their regulation of <abbr title="specified radioactive substances activities">SRSAs</abbr>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Who must pay a charge</h3>

<p>An application charge must be paid by the person applying for the permit. Or in the case of a variation or surrender, by the person who holds the permit.</p>

<p>A transfer application charge has to be paid by one or both of the people applying for the transfer of a permit.</p>

<p>Subsistence charges have to be paid by the holder of the permit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span> Payments by householders, charities and public bodies</h3>

<p>The charges set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">charging scheme</a> apply to everyone, including companies, householders, charities and public bodies.</p>

<p>Some activities are likely to be carried out by householders, or for non-commercial purposes. In some specific cases the Environment Agency has chosen not to recover the full costs of regulating those activities.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency does not recover the full cost of processing applications for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-commercial flood-risk activities carried out to improve the environment</li>
  <li>flood risk activity work in the area of land around a house and carried out by (or on behalf of) the householder under permitted development rights</li>
  <li>sewage effluent discharges with a volume up to and including 5m<sup>3</sup> a day to surface water or groundwater from domestic households or organisations operating for charitable purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>A domestic household is a premises that is exempt from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/introduction-to-business-rates">business rates</a>.</p>

<p>An organisation operating for charitable purposes must have a charity registration number or a HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) charity number.</p>

<p>The full application cost will apply if a sewage effluent discharge with a volume up to and including 5m<sup>3</sup> a day to surface water or groundwater is carried out by a mix of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>domestic households</li>
  <li>organisations operating for charitable purposes</li>
  <li>other applicants who pay the full application cost</li>
</ul>

<p>The applicants should decide how to split the application costs.</p>

<p>You also do not pay an annual subsistence charge to discharge sewage effluent if both of these apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the maximum daily volume of discharge authorised by the permit is 5 cubic metres or less</li>
  <li>the permit holder is a domestic householder, or an organisation or entity that operates for charitable purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span> Charges for future standard rules</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency consults on charges for new standard rules. They will do this as part of the consultation on the rules themselves. The Environment Agency will select an appropriate charge for new standard rules from those already used in the tables of charges.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will confirm the charges that will apply in their published response to the consultation on the standard rules. Those charges will then apply.</p>

<p>Charges that are set in this way will be incorporated into the charging scheme following the next review.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Permit application charges</h2>

<p>This section is about permit application charges and when you need to pay extra application charges.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> New permit charge</h3>

<p>You must pay a charge to apply for a new permit. You must pay your charge when you apply.</p>

<p>The application charge depends on your activity and the type of permit you have. You can find the application charges for different activities in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>The baseline charge for an application covers the work the Environment Agency carries out each time they determine a typical permit application.</p>

<p>Some permit applications will need extra work that is not covered by the baseline application charge. In these cases you will need to pay additional charges. For example if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the permit is of high public interest</li>
  <li>an extra technical assessment is needed, for example of an odour management plan</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Basic pre-application advice</h3>

<p>Before you apply for a permit the Environment Agency can give you a limited amount of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-advice-before-you-apply-for-an-environmental-permit#basic-advice">pre-application advice</a>. This will help you get your application right first time and get a decision more quickly. They can provide this for new permits, variations, transfers and surrender applications. The cost of this advice is included in the application charge.</p>

<p>You must read the relevant Environment Agency guides for your activity before you apply:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Enhanced pre-application advice</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency charges Â£100 an hour plus VAT for their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-advice-before-you-apply-for-an-environmental-permit#enhanced-paid-for-advice">enhanced pre-application advice service</a>. This is a discretionary service which you can request if you want more help with your application.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency may give you advice by email, phone, video conference or face to face.</p>

<p>They will give you a written estimate before they start work. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a breakdown of the work they will carry out, with costs</li>
  <li>when these costs will be charged (approximately)</li>
</ul>

<p>If they receive new information from you (or others), they may need to revise their estimate. They will tell you what this is and agree with you in writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any changes to the scope of the work requested</li>
  <li>their cost estimate</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-advice-before-you-apply-for-an-environmental-permit#contact-the-pre-application-advice-service">Apply for enhanced pre-application advice</a> using the form most appropriate to your main activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Staged application procedure charge</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency may agree that you can submit pre-application and application information in stages. For example, this could be where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development and commissioning in a major proposal could be spread over a number of phases or over a reasonable period of time</li>
  <li>the proposal is particularly complex, or includes novel technologies</li>
  <li>you wish to reduce possible business risks by consulting in detail with the Environment Agency and the public</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, the Environment Agency will charge for the costs of their time and materials for each stage of information submitted. The rate is Â£100 an hour.</p>

<p>If you wish to apply for a permit based on the staged procedure, <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">contact the Environment Agency</a> to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> High public interest applications charge</h3>

<p>Under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016, the Environment Agency must publish a public participation statement explaining how they will consult on decisions about environmental permits. In their statement, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-when-and-how-we-consult">Environmental permits: when and how we consult</a> the Environment Agency says they will carry out extra consultation with the public where an application is of high public interest, and they explain what this means.</p>

<p>This extra work would not be covered by the fixed application charge.</p>

<p>If the Environment Agency decides your application is of high public interest they will charge for extra costs they incur on a time and materials basis. This is because the amount of work required for these types of sites can be unpredictable.</p>

<p>They will charge Â£100 an hour. You must pay these extra charges before your application is determined.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Advertising charge</h3>

<p>If the Environment Agency needs to advertise your application in a newspaper, for example because it is of high public interest, they will need to recover the cost of placing the advert. They will charge you Â£500 for each application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Repeated information notices charge</h3>

<p>When determining an application the Environment Agency may need to send you an information notice to get more details about a particular issue in your application. If they need to send you 3 or more information notices about the same issue, because you have not provided all the information needed on that issue, they will recover their extra costs.</p>

<p>For repeated additional information notices about the same issue, you will need to pay a fixed charge of Â£1,200 for each notice. You must pay this extra charge before your application is determined.</p>

<p>If the Environment Agency sends you an additional information notice, they will tell you if it is about the same issue as previous notices.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Assessing plans charge</h3>

<p>If the Environment Agency needs to carry out additional assessments for a particular activity at a particular location, they will charge extra for this work. In some cases the costs of assessing these plans is included in the fixed application charge. The activity description in table 1 of the environmental permitting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a> will say if this is the case.</p>

<p>You must pay this charge when applying for a new permit or if you need to submit a new plan when applying for a permit variation.</p>

<p>The plans and assessments are listed in table 1.19 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>. They are:</p>

<p>For certain protected sites, a habitats assessment â a fixed charge of Â£779.</p>

<p>This is an assessment of the risks to one or more of these sites, a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>European Site within the meaning of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017</li>
  <li>site referred to in the National Planning Policy Framework 2018 as requiring the same assessment as a European Site</li>
  <li>site of special scientific interest within the meaning of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</li>
  <li>marine conservation zone within the meaning of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009</li>
</ul>

<p>For new bespoke applications, the habitats assessment charge will apply where one or more of these sites is close enough to require assessment.</p>

<p>Where your application is to vary your existing permit, the charge will not apply if it is obvious that the nature of your proposed changes have no possibility of any effect on any habitat site.</p>

<p>Permit applications for a flood risk activity, or water activity carried out by householders or for non-commercial purposes (see section 1.7) do not attract an additional habitats assessment charge.</p>

<p>For intensive farming installations only, assessing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-permitting-air-dispersion-modelling-reports">ammonia modelling assessment</a> â a fixed charge of Â£620</li>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/intensive-farming-risk-assessment-for-your-environmental-permit">dust and bio-aerosol management plan</a> â a fixed charge of Â£620</li>
</ul>

<p>For other activities (excluding intensive farming installations) assessing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-prevention-plans-environmental-permits">fire prevention plan</a> â a fixed charge of Â£1,241</li>

<h4>2.8.1 Waste recovery plans (<abbr title="waste recovery plans">WRPs</abbr>)</h4>

<p>If your application is for the permanent deposit of waste on land as a recovery activity you must provide a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deposit-for-recovery-operators-environmental-permits/waste-recovery-plans-and-deposit-for-recovery-permits"><abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr></a>. Your <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> demonstrates that you are carrying out a waste recovery activity. You can submit your <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> either at the pre-application stage or as part of your application.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency recommends that you submit the <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> at the pre-application stage so they can assess it before you submit your permit application. If you submit the <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> with a new permit application and the Environment Agency assess the activity as disposal, they will refuse the application and retain the charge. The Environment Agency will not issue a deposit for recovery permit where they assess the <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> proposal as a disposal activity.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will charge Â£1,231 to assess each new, varied or revised <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> you submit.</p>

<p>If you want to change your <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> after the Environment Agency has assessed the plan and approved your recovery activity, you will need to pay another assessment charge. This is to cover the cost of reassessing your revised plan. You will not be charged for an administrative change.</p>

<p>This could happen if the Environment Agency has assessed your <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> during the pre-application stage, but you then submit, with your application, a <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr> you have changed. If your changes mean that the Environment Agency has to reassess your <abbr title="waste recovery plan">WRP</abbr>, you will need to pay another assessment charge. For example, if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased the volume of waste</li>
  <li>changed the type of waste</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> Ship recycling authorisations charge</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency charges for time and materials for applications and renewals of authorisations under the Ship Recycling Facilities Regulations 2015. The rate is Â£100 an hour.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.10 </span> Charge for changing your application</h3>

<p>If you want to change your application before it has been determined, and more public consultation is needed as a result, you must pay an extra charge. For example, changing the proposed operator, or making a significant change to your activities or scale of operations.</p>

<p>There is a fixed charge of Â£1,930 for this. You must pay this charge before your application is determined. This charge is separate to the advertising charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.11 </span> Partial refund of an application charge</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency will check your application to make sure it is complete and they can accept it as âduly madeâ. This means they have enough information to start to determine your permit application. They will contact you if information is missing. Where they request missing information, you will need to submit it before the date requested, and this will be a maximum of 10 working days.</p>

<p>If they cannot progress your application past this stage for any reason, they will return it and refund the application charge minus 20% to cover their costs to that point.</p>

<p>They will not charge this if they return an application after having done very little work â because it contained obvious errors or omissions.</p>

<p>They can keep up to a maximum of Â£1,500.</p>

<p>If you withdraw your application between the âduly madeâ and âdeterminationâ stages, the Environment Agency will normally keep your application charge to cover their costs. However, if appropriate, they may consider using an âabatement decisionâ to refund some of your charge. Section 7.4 explains when they will do this.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.12 </span> Application charge for multiple activities under one permit</h3>

<p>This section does not apply to flood risk activities. See the section 2.12.3 on flood risk activity for charges for these activities.</p>

<p>For installations and waste activities the Environment Agency often receives applications for large, integrated plant. These activities may either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be directly related to a single main activity or be related to each other</li>
  <li>take place on the same site even though they are not related to each other</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are applying for one permit that covers more than one type of activity, or more than one activity of the same type, you need to calculate the correct application charge using this approach.</p>

<p>Using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>, you need to calculate the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>100% of the relevant application charge in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a> for the largest application fee</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>50% of the relevant application charge for any secondary activities that can reasonably be considered to be part of the same operation â to reflect the time saved during the determination period, for example, by only needing one consultation or one set of operator competence checks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10% of the relevant application charge for the same activity carried out multiple times on the same site</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are 2 special cases where the application charge for secondary activities is calculated at 10% of the relevant charge. These are an application for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a hazardous waste installation treatment activity with associated storage of hazardous waste â the application charge for the associated storage will be 10% of the relevant application charge</li>
  <li>any activity that also includes an associated non-hazardous effluent treatment plant that discharges to the sewer â the application charge for the associated effluent treatment plant will be 10% of the relevant application charge</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of this approach.</p>

<h4>2.12.1 Water discharge activities</h4>

<p>A sewerage undertaker operating a waste water treatment works may be carrying out these 3 activities, each requiring a permit. The discharge of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treated sewage effluent</li>
  <li>storm sewage effluent</li>
  <li>settled storm sewage effluent</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the application charge will be the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the largest application charge â the discharge of treated sewage effluent</li>
  <li>50% of the application charge for the discharge of storm sewage effluent</li>
  <li>10% of the application charge for the discharge of settled storm sewage effluent</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.12.2 Onshore oil and gas (<abbr title="onshore oil and gas">OOG</abbr>)</h4>

<p><abbr title="onshore oil and gas">OOG</abbr> sites can often carry out several different activities that each need a permit, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>operating a mining waste operation or facility (managing extractive wastes) with or without a flare</li>
  <li>carrying out a groundwater activity (for example, re-injecting produced waters)</li>
  <li>managing radioactive substances</li>
</ul>

<p>On an <abbr title="onshore oil and gas">OOG</abbr> site where the activities needing a permit include a mining waste activity and a groundwater activity, the application charge will be calculated as the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the main activity application charge (mining waste operation with or without a facility and with or without a flare)</li>
  <li>50% of the application charges for other activities â such as the groundwater activity</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.12.3 Flood risk activity example</h4>

<p>Charges for more than one flood risk activity are the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the application charge for the activity with the largest charge</li>
  <li>25% of the application charge for each additional flood risk activity</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.12.4 Waste installation example</h4>

<p>Charges for a new bespoke permit for the chemical treatment and transfer of hazardous waste for disposal or recovery, and an associated effluent treatment plant treating non-hazardous waste and discharging to the sewer, are the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the highest application charge of the 2 activities â in this case it is the hazardous waste treatment activity for disposal</li>
  <li>10% of the application charge for the second hazardous waste treatment activity for recovery</li>
  <li>10% of the application charge for the associated non-hazardous effluent treatment</li>
  <li>10% of the application charge for the associated storage of hazardous waste in connection with chemical treatment facility</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.12.5 Waste operation example</h4>

<p>Charges for a new bespoke operation made up of a household, commercial and industrial waste transfer station activity and a vehicle dismantling activity are the sum of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100% of the application charge for the activity with the highest charge â in this case it is the household, commercial and industrial waste transfer station activity</li>
  <li>50% of the application charge for the metal recycling site â vehicle dismantling activity</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.13 </span> Standalone directly associated activity application charge</h3>

<p>At some industrial installations an operator may apply for a permit for a standalone directly associated activity regulated by the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>This could be because the activity is to be controlled separately to the operation of the main installation by the main operator. The operator of the standalone directly associated activity must have their own permit.</p>

<p>This charge applies where the activity is not a part A(1), part A(2) or part B activity. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-need-an-environmental-permit#check-if-you-need-a-permit-and-who-to-apply-to">Check if your activity is classed as part A(1), part A(2) or part B</a>.</p>

<p>The charge would be 90% of the most relevant application charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.14 </span> Local authority activity application charge</h3>

<p>Sometimes the Environment Agency regulates activities normally regulated by local authorities. This may be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are within the boundary of, and serving activities on, an A(1) installation already regulated by the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency has been given powers to regulate them</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, they could be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part A(2) activity</li>
  <li>small waste incineration plant</li>
  <li>part B activity</li>
</ul>

<p>For these permits you must pay the activity application charge listed in table 1.18 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>. These are based on equivalent local authority charges.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.15 </span> Waste electrical and electronic equipment (<abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr>) registration charge</h3>

<p>You must pay a charge of Â£1,221, to register a <abbr title="waste electrical and electronic equipment">WEEE</abbr> operation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.16 </span> Water discharge and groundwater activities with shared treatment</h3>

<p>Sometimes a water discharge or groundwater activity is made up of more than one effluent and they are treated together. For example, a sewage treatment plant treating sewage effluent and trade effluent together. Where this is the case the Environment Agency will charge one variation fee based on the effluent with the highest volume. They will regard other changes as administrative which are free of charge. If the volumes of sewage and trade effluent are equal, the variation charge is based on the sewage effluent component.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Varying a permit charges</h2>

<p>You may have to pay a variation charge if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you apply to vary your permit</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency decides they must vary your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not apply if you are only making an administrative change.</p>

<p>Depending on the change to the permit and the permit regime, you can apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an administrative change (no charge)</li>
  <li>a minor variation</li>
  <li>a normal variation</li>
  <li>a substantial variation</li>
</ul>

<p>Variation costs are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>If you are carrying out multiple activities, your application to vary can include one or more of the different types of variation.</p>

<p>If you are changing from one activity to another, you pay the variation charge for the activity you are changing to. The Environment Agency will assess this new activity to set your permit conditions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Variations</h3>

<p>Some types of variations have a fixed charge not listed in the tables of charges.</p>

<h4>3.1.1 Flood risk activity variation</h4>

<p>For flood risk activity permit variations you need to pay a fixed charge of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£68 for a minor variation</li>
  <li>Â£204 for any other variation</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.1.2 Water discharge activity variation</h4>

<p>Sewerage companies varying a permit for Event Duration Monitoring under 5 yearly asset management plans pay a fixed charge of Â£903.</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Intensive farming variation after a permit review</h4>

<p>There is a fixed charge of Â£380 for a variation needed as the result of reviewing a farming installation permit. For this to apply the review must follow the process agreed by the Environment Agency. This process is designed to ensure that each variation will take no more than 5 hours.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Standard rules variations</h3>

<p>For a standard rules permit you can only apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an administrative only variation</li>
  <li>a minor variation, for example to change your site boundary</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.2.1 Change standard rules to a bespoke permit</h4>

<p>If you want to make a more significant change to your standard rules permit you must apply for a bespoke permit.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of change you want to make, you must apply for either a normal or a substantial variation to change your permit into a bespoke permit. You must apply for a substantial variation when it is likely to involve significant assessment. For example, if there is significant increase to the risk from your operations as a result of the change, it is most likely to be a substantial variation. You can get advice from the Environment Agencyâs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-advice-before-you-apply-for-an-environmental-permit">pre-application service</a> before you apply. You pay the variation charge for the activity you are changing to. The relevant charges are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Change bespoke permit to standard rules for the same activity</h4>

<p>To change an existing bespoke permit to a standard rules permit for the same activity type, you must pay the relevant standard rules permit application charge. These are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<h4>3.2.3 Change standard rules to a different set of standard rules</h4>

<p>To change a standard rules permit to a different standard rules permit, you must pay the application charge for the new standard rules. The relevant charges are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<h4>3.2.4 Fixed condition licences</h4>

<p>Fixed condition licences now pay the same charges as bespoke permits. These are waste operations which originally had waste management licences granted by the Environment Agency as fixed condition licences.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Administrative only variation</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency does not charge for administrative only variations because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do not need any kind of technical assessment</li>
  <li>are likely to take less than 2 hours to process</li>
</ul>

<p>You must pay a variation charge if the Environment Agency considers that any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they need to carry out a technical assessment</li>
  <li>they need to consult on your variation</li>
  <li>you are making several administrative changes on a significant number of permits, or several changes to one permit</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples of administrative only variations.</p>

<h4>3.3.1 Administrative only variations for all permits</h4>

<p>You want to change or correct:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a name or address but where the legal entity has not changed</li>
  <li>a National Grid Reference to improve accuracy</li>
  <li>typographical errors</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3.2 Administrative only variations for waste or installations permits</h4>

<p>When a change in legislation means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can no longer accept a particular type of waste</li>
  <li>you no longer need a permit for a particular type of operation</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3.3 Administrative only variations for water discharge and groundwater activities</h4>

<p>You want to change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the start date of a permit</li>
  <li>an outlet location â as long as a new technical assessment is not needed</li>
  <li>a sample point location</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3.4 Administrative only variations for radioactive substances activities</h4>

<p>You want to consolidate an:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RSA93 open registration and a RSA93 authorisation</li>
  <li>RSA93 sealed source registration and a RSA93 mobile sealed sources registration</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, this only applies when transferring the registration or authorisation to another operator.</p>

<h4>3.3.5 Administrative only variations for flood risk activities</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change operator details</li>
  <li>vary a condition, or an aspect, of a standalone flood risk activity and a technical assessment is not needed</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.3.6 Administrative only variations for intensive farming permits</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce animal numbers by any amount</li>
  <li>remove an emission point</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Minor variation</h3>

<p>A minor variation is one that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>needs some technical input from the Environment Agency â but much less than for a normal variation</li>
  <li>does not need external consultation</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the minor variation charges for each activity type in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of minor variations.</p>

<h4>3.4.1 Water discharge and groundwater activities minor variations</h4>

<p>You want to make a change to a permit that does not require a new emission limits assessment as a result. For example, you want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change an outlet location on a descriptive permit (a permit which does not have numeric emission limits)</li>
  <li>change the volume of the discharge on a descriptive permit</li>
  <li>reduce the volume of the discharge to an amount which is based on water meter readings rather than Flows and Loads</li>
  <li>reduce the volume of land spreading sheep dip and pesticides</li>
  <li>cross an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/waste-water-treatment-works-treatment-monitoring-and-compliance-limits/waste-water-treatment-works-treatment-monitoring-and-compliance-limits#crossing-a-population-equivalent-threshold">Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulations (UWWTR) threshold</a> and you are required to change your permit to begin or change your UWWTR monitoring requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>If the change to a descriptive permit means that numeric emission limits are required to be added to the permit, this would be a normal variation (or substantial variation if a new assessment for specific substances is needed).</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Waste and installations minor variations</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change your annual throughput with no increase in storage capacity required and no increase in environmental risk</li>
  <li>change the list of wastes your permit allows your facility to accept, where there is no increase in risk to the environment or a change in activity, for example, adding a waste code similar to those you already accept or removing waste codes you no longer need</li>
  <li>remove a regulated activity from a permit but not reduce the site area</li>
  <li>change the type of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landfill-operators-environmental-permits/calculate-your-financial-provision">financial provision</a> for a landfill site, including changing from a 3 year to a 1 year bond and a 1 year bond to a 3 year bond</li>
</ul>

<p>If your proposed changes will alter the nature of your facilityâs operation or increase the environmental risk posed, you will need to apply for a normal or substantial variation.</p>

<h4>3.4.3 Intensive farming minor variations</h4>

<p>Where you want to make minor changes to your operations or site and a new technical assessment is not needed as a result. For example, if you want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change the type of poultry you stock but livestock numbers are decreasing and an ammonia screening assessment is not needed as ammonia emissions are not increasing (such as stocking turkeys on a broiler farm)</li>
  <li>adding a biomass boiler where you meet the criteria for not requiring an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/intensive-farming-risk-assessment-for-your-environmental-permit#air-emissions-biomass-boilers">air emissions assessment</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.4.5 Radioactive substances activities minor variations</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce any limit or remove any radionuclide in a permit</li>
  <li>remove one or more disposal routes from a permit</li>
  <li>increase the permitted area of a facility where no other changes are being made</li>
  <li>increase by no more than 10% the holding limit for any unsealed source â where the variation is by notice and you are not consolidating permits</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Normal variation</h3>

<p>A normal variation will need technical input by the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>You can find the normal variation charges for each activity in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to submit a new chargeable plan with your variation application, you must pay a charge to have the new plan assessed, unless the activity description includes a reference to that plan.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of normal variations.</p>

<h4>3.5.1 Water discharge and groundwater activities normal variations</h4>

<p>You want to make a change to a permit that requires a new emissions limit assessment as a result. For example, if you want to change:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an outlet location on a numeric permit (a permit which has numeric emission limits)</li>
  <li>the volume of the discharge on a numeric permit</li>
  <li>the quality (or content) of a discharge on a numeric permit</li>
  <li>a descriptive permit to the extent that numeric emission limits are required to be added</li>
</ul>

<p>You want to reduce the pass forward flow for intermittent storm sewage discharges.</p>

<p>If you want to change the volume or change the quality (or content) of a discharge this would be a normal variation. However, if the discharge contains specific substances, or will contain them as a result of the change, this would be a substantial variation.</p>

<p>Specific substances are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hazardous pollutants for water discharge activities</li>
  <li>hazardous substances or non-hazardous pollutants for groundwater activities</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.5.2 Waste and installations normal variations</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make a change to a permitted activity (for example an increase in storage capacity) that requires you to resubmit a site-specific plan for assessment â for example a fire prevention, odour or emissions management plan</li>
  <li>increase the permitted area of a bespoke permit or add treatment (recovery and disposal) codes not covered by your permit</li>
  <li>make a change that would alter the nature of your facilityâs operation or increase the environmental risk posed</li>
  <li>close an operational landfill so that it can enter the aftercare phase</li>
  <li>ask the Environment Agency to review the amount of financial provision (an increase or a decrease both require a technical assessment of a new expenditure plan)</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/landfill-operators-environmental-permits/calculate-your-financial-provision">Find out more about financial provision for landfill</a>.</p>

<h4>3.5.3 Intensive farming normal variations</h4>

<p>You want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the number of animals you keep where the increase is below the threshold specified in the Schedule 1 activity description (for example, increasing by no more than 40,000 poultry places, 750 sows or 2,000 production pigs greater than 30kg)</li>
  <li>add directly associated activities such as biomass boilers or poultry litter burners which require an air emissions assessment</li>
  <li>add new or extend existing housing</li>
  <li>add emission points to air, water or land</li>
  <li>increase the permitted area</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Substantial variation</h3>

<p>This section does not apply to radioactive substances activities.</p>

<p>A substantial variation is one where the Environment Agency has to carry out significant assessment. The relevant charges are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to submit a new plan with your variation application, you must pay a charge to have the new plan assessed. See section 2.8 Assessing plans charge.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of substantial variations.</p>

<h4>3.6.1 Water discharge and groundwater activities</h4>

<p>You would need a substantial variation if you want to change the volume (or change the quality) of a discharge and a new assessment of emissions limits for specific substances is needed. Specific substances are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hazardous pollutants for water discharge activities</li>
  <li>hazardous substances or non-hazardous pollutants for groundwater activities</li>
</ul>

<p>For water discharge activities, a substantial variation does not apply if all specific substances are screened out by the risk assessment.</p>

<h4>3.6.2 Installations</h4>

<p>You would need a substantial variation if you want to make changes to an activity carried that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would make that activity a part A(1) activity in its own right â for example by increasing the volume of tonnes per hour (or per day) being processed so it reaches the threshold for a part A(1) activity</li>
  <li>increases the treatment or storage capacity on an existing part A(1) by more than the threshold specified in the Schedule 1 activity description</li>
  <li>may have significant negative effects on human health or the environment</li>
</ul>

<p>You would also need a substantial variation if you wanted to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incinerate or co-incinerate hazardous waste in a plant with a permit to incinerate or co-incinerate non-hazardous waste</li>
  <li>apply for a derogation from the emissions standards set by the Industrial Emissions Directive â which would mean the Environment Agency has to vary your permit</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.6.3 Waste</h4>

<p>You would need a substantial variation to your waste permit if you want to make a change that would significantly increase the risk from your operations. For example, if you want to change your waste activity from an inert waste transfer and treatment facility to a household commercial and industrial waste transfer and treatment facility. The new activity would need to replace the existing activity and you would need to be using some of the existing infrastructure and plant.</p>

<p>You would pay the relevant substantial variation charge for the replacement activity.</p>

<p>Where you want to change a waste standard rules permit to a bespoke permit for a different activity, this will most likely require significant assessment. Therefore due to the significant increase in the risk from your operations, you will require a substantial variation.</p>

<h4>3.6.4 Intensive farming</h4>

<p>You would need a substantial variation if you want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the number of animals or birds you keep where the increase is above the threshold specified in the Schedule 1 activity description (for example, increase of more than 40,000 poultry places, 750 sows or 2,000 production pigs greater than 30kg)</li>
  <li>make changes which may have significant negative effects on human health or the environment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Variation for multiple activities on one permit</h3>

<p>If you want to vary a permit that covers more than one activity you must pay a variation charge for each activity you want to vary.</p>

<p>If your change affects other activities on the same permit, that means they will also need to be changed. You will need to pay a variation charge for each of the other activities affected.</p>

<p>The discounts that apply to multiple activities for new permits do not apply to variations. See section 2.12 which gives more information.</p>

<p>You can combine different types of variations depending on the types of changes you want to make to each activity. For example, combining a minor variation and a normal variation. Your charge will be the sum of the individual variation charges. The Environment Agency will assess each application charge. If the sum of the variation charges is more than the cost of a new multi-activity permit they will consider whether to use an âabatement decisionâ to refund some of the charges. Section 7.4 explains when they will do this.</p>

<h4>3.7.1 The same activity multiple times on one permit</h4>

<p>If you have a permit that covers the same activity multiple times, you pay a variation charge when changing each repeat activity. However, if you want to make the same change, at the same time, to a second or subsequent repeat activities, you do not need to pay another variation charge. This is because the changes to the second or subsequent repeat activities are regarded as administrative changes which are free of charge. Application charge discounts for multiple activities under one permit applies to new multi-activity permits only. It does not apply to variations. See section 2.12 which gives more information.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a permit to produce lime with 5 repeat activities (table of charges reference 1.13.1, section 3.1 â production of cement using waste derived fuels) you only pay a variation charge to change the first activity. Making the same change, at the same time, to the other repeat activities will be free of charge.</p>

<h4>3.7.2 Multiple activities and changes to plant or infrastructure</h4>

<p>If you have a permit that covers multiple activities and you apply to change any plant or infrastructure (for example replacing the boilers), you pay the highest variation charge of the activities affected. Any changes to the other activities are then regarded as administrative variations and will be free of charge. This applies if it is a minor, normal or substantial variation.</p>

<h4>3.7.3 Multiple activities and changes to waste types</h4>

<p>If you have a permit that covers multiple activities and you apply to change waste types across a number of different activities (provided there is no increase in risk to the environment or a change in activity by each of the proposed changes), you pay the single highest minor variation charge of the activities being affected. The Environment Agency regards changes to the other activities as administrative variations, so they are free of charge.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> Add an activity to an existing permit</h3>

<p>If you want to add an activity to your permit, you must pay the charge for a new permit application for that type of activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span> Remove an activity and its site area from a permit</h3>

<p>This applies to installations, waste and mining waste permits only. If you want to remove an activity from your permit and the portion of your site area associated with it, you must apply to partially surrender that part of the permit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.10 </span> Remove authorisations where operations have not started</h3>

<p>If you want to remove authorisations for all, or parts of a permit, and you have not started any activity on those parts of the site, you require a permit variation rather than a surrender. You must pay the lower of either Â£770 or the minor variation charge for the activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.11 </span> Consolidate permits through variations</h3>

<h4>3.11.1 Consolidate a single permit</h4>

<p>If you have a permit which already has modern conditions, the Environment Agency will normally provide a new, updated permit whenever variations are made. That way you always have one up to date permit.</p>

<p>If you have a permit with old style conditions, you can ask the Environment Agency to consolidate any variations into one permit with modern conditions. Sometimes the Environment Agency may decide this is appropriate to do under a regulator initiated variation. In either case, the charge will be the normal variation charge. Where more than one activity is authorised, the normal variation charge will only apply to the activity with the highest charge. The Environment Agency will regard the other changes as administrative variations which are free of charge.</p>

<p>You can also ask the Environment Agency to consolidate any variations into one modern permit when you apply for a normal or substantial variation.</p>

<p>When processing an application for a variation, the Environment Agency may decide to consolidate your permit by making a regulator initiated variation, at the same time.</p>

<p>You do not need to pay for updating or consolidating in these cases. You only pay the relevant variation charge.</p>

<h4>3.11.2 Consolidate 2 or more permits into 1</h4>

<p>If you have several permits for one site you may want to consolidate (combine) them into one permit. The Environment Agency will only do this if the permits already have modern conditions or if you are happy to move to a permit with modern conditions.</p>

<p>If you are applying to vary one of the permits as a normal or substantial variation and would like your permits to be consolidated at the same time, you need to pay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the relevant variation charge</li>
  <li>minor variation charges for each additional permit being consolidated</li>
</ul>

<p>If you request to consolidate multiple permits with no associated variation, then you will need to pay the highest normal variation charge plus a minor variation charge for each of the additional permits being consolidated.</p>

<p>If the work to consolidate is more significant, you need to pay the normal variation charge for each of the additional permits being consolidated. The Environment Agency will tell you if this is the case.</p>

<p>Where each permit being consolidated covers multiple activities then the appropriate variation for each permit is the single highest chargeable activity in each permit.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Transfer a permit</h2>

<p>If you want to transfer your permit to a different operator you may have to pay a transfer charge. These are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>. You can transfer either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all of your permit</li>
  <li>part of your permit (partial transfer) â except for mobile plant</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to pay for a full or partial transfer for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water discharge activity</li>
  <li>groundwater activity</li>
  <li>part B installation</li>
  <li>flood risk activity</li>
</ul>

<p>However, for any of these, if a partial transfer needs a variation to that permit, then you must also pay the relevant variation charge.</p>

<p>For other types of permits, if you with to transfer the whole permit, the transfer charge is based on the highest transfer charge for the authorised activities being transferred.</p>

<p>If you have a permit and you wish to partially transfer an activity or activities, you must also pay the normal variation charge for the single highest activity on the permit before transfer.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Batch transfers</h3>

<p>This section does not apply to radioactive substances activities permits or landfill permits.</p>

<p>A batch transfer is when you transfer a number of your permits to a single operator at the same time.</p>

<p>The total amount to pay in this case will be the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>largest relevant transfer charge</li>
  <li>additional relevant transfer charges â reduced by 80% â for the remaining transfers taking place at the same time</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Permit transfers and compliance rating</h3>

<p>When you transfer a permit (either part or full), the compliance rating for the permit will also transfer to the new operator.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Surrender a permit</h2>

<p>If you want to surrender some or all of the activities in your permit you may have to pay a surrender charge. The relevant charges are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>Depending on the change to the permit and the type of permit, you can apply for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full or partial surrender</li>
  <li>low risk surrender</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to pay for a full or partial surrender for a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water discharge activity</li>
  <li>groundwater activity</li>
  <li>part B installation</li>
  <li>flood risk activity</li>
</ul>

<p>However, for these activities, if a partial surrender needs a variation to the remaining permit, then you must pay the relevant variation charge in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a permit that covers more than one activity and you wish to surrender some or all of those activities, you must pay the surrender charge for the single highest activity that has at any time been authorised by the permit. This excludes any activity where the Environment Agency has already accepted surrender.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Reduce the site area or remove an activity</h3>

<p>To remove an activity from your permit that does not have an area of the site associated with it, you need to apply for a minor variation and pay the minor variation charge for that activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Low risk surrenders</h3>

<h4>5.2.1 Permanent deposit of waste</h4>

<p>You can apply for low risk surrender of a permit that allows the permanent deposit of waste.</p>

<p>You must ask the Environment Agency to confirm whether or not you can apply for a low risk surrender before you submit your application. You must follow their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/landfill-epr-502-and-other-permanent-deposits-of-waste-how-to-surrender-your-environmental-permit">technical guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If they agree you can apply for a low risk surrender. The charge will be 20% of the permit application charge for that activity.</p>

<h4>5.2.2 Other activities</h4>

<p>If you want to apply for a low risk surrender for any other activity, the Environment Agency must confirm that an intrusive investigation is not needed. See their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permitting-h5-site-condition-report">technical guidance about site condition reporting</a>.</p>

<p>If they agree you can apply for a low risk surrender, the charge will be 20% of the permit application charge for that activity.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Subsistence charges</h2>

<p>The Environment Agency recovers the costs of regulating an activity through annual subsistence charges. Subsistence is charged for the time a permit is in force, including for all or part of a financial year.</p>

<p>Part 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a> lists the subsistence charges for different activities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Issue date for subsistence invoices</h3>

<p>In most cases, the Environment Agency will send you an invoice at the beginning of April. The charging year is from 1 April to 31 March.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Future start date in a permit</h3>

<p>Subsistence charges start from the date your permit is issued. If your permit states that your operations will start from a specified date in the future, the subsistence charge is payable from that date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Before construction or operations start</h3>

<p>If there is a delay between the issue of your permit and beginning work to construct or operate your site, you do not need to start paying the subsistence charge. For radioactive substances activities you do not need to start paying subsistence until the radioactive source needed for the activity is on the permitted site. This is because the Environment Agency has not yet started regulatory scrutiny of the site.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Environment Agency sets pre-operational conditions and will carry out additional assessments at the design stage before an operation starts. They recover the costs for this work under their charge for approvals required by permit conditions as set out in section 6.6. They normally charge for time and materials at Â£100 an hour.</p>

<h4>6.3.1 Waste incinerators and co-incinerators</h4>

<p>For waste incinerators and co-incinerators the Environment Agency will charge</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fixed pre-construction charge of Â£1,659</li>
  <li>full subsistence charges as soon as construction begins</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency will also charge a higher charge from when construction of a new plant begins until 2 years after it has been commissioned. See table 2.6 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a> which lists charges for new and existing plants.</p>

<p>âCommissionedâ usually means when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operator has taken over the plant from the engineering, procurement and construction contractor</li>
  <li>a certificate for acceptance (or equivalent) has been issued</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, it could be at some other point in the commissioning process, if agreed in writing with the Environment Agency.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> First year of operation charge</h3>

<p>This section only applies to the waste treatment sector (activities in table 2.16 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>).</p>

<p>When you receive your permit, you must pay a one off extra charge of Â£672 for the first year of your operations. You must pay this in full.</p>

<p>This charge covers the costs of additional regulatory effort by the Environment Agency to provide advice and support during your first year of operations. They do this to make sure your operation starts off on the correct basis â itâs more cost effective than trying to put things right later.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Unplanned compliance work charges</h3>

<p>Annual subsistence charges pay for planned compliance work at a site with a permit. If the Environment Agency has to carry out unplanned compliance work in connection with the permit, they will, in specific sets of circumstances, charge for the extra time and materials used.</p>

<h4>6.5.1 When time and materials costs will be charged</h4>

<p>The Environment Agency will charge time and materials costs for dealing with an unplanned event that could cause significant harm to human health or the environment. For example a confirmed category 1 or 2 pollution incident â as classified under the Environment Agencyâs common incident classification scheme.</p>

<p>These charges will apply regardless of a siteâs current compliance band.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will also charge time and materials for work once they have decided to suspend an operatorâs permit to make operations stop temporarily. The suspension could be due to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the risk of pollution</li>
  <li>non-payment of charges</li>
</ul>

<p>Charging for time and materials allows the Environment Agency to recover costs quickly for the additional regulatory effort resulting from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dealing with the result of an unplanned event</li>
  <li>investigating the cause of an unplanned event</li>
  <li>serving and then lifting a suspension and bringing a site back into compliance after a suspension</li>
</ul>

<p>Time and materials charging also allows the Environment Agency to recover the costs of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any consultants, contractors or equipment they may need to use</li>
  <li>carrying out community engagement work that may be needed as the result of a pollution incident or permit suspension</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency time and materials charge is Â£84 an hour for staff time plus the cost of any materials or equipment used.</p>

<p>If the Environment Agency needs to charge you for time and materials they will keep you informed of any costs incurred and how they are broken down.</p>

<p>Where the Environment Agency can already recover costs for unplanned work they may continue to do so. For example, by applying section 161ZC of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/57/contents" rel="external">Water Resources Act 1991</a> for water pollution incidents. The Environment Agency will only ever charge an operator once for any costs they incur.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span> Charge for approvals required by permit conditions</h3>

<p>If your permit has a condition that states you must send the Environment Agency information for them to assess or approve, you must pay a charge to cover the cost of this work. For example, you may need to send them a plan, report or assessment to approve.</p>

<p>You will be charged for time and materials at a rate of Â£100 an hour.</p>

<p>This charge will cover the amount of time taken to assess your information and decide whether to approve it.</p>

<p>You would need to submit information for approval for these types of permit conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-operational</li>
  <li>improvement</li>
  <li>where you need to submit management plans for approval â such as odour management plans or fire prevention plans</li>
</ul>

<p>The wording of the conditions in your permit will make it clear when you need to get approval or agreement from the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>This charge will not apply to pre-operational or improvement conditions in new waste incinerator or co-incinerator permits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span> Effect of compliance rating on subsistence</h3>
<p>This section applies to installations and waste operations only.</p>

<p>Some subsistence charges are adjusted according to your compliance band. But this does not apply to permits for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>farming installations operated by members of the Environment Agencyâs intensive farming <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pig-and-poultry-assurance-scheme-intensive-farming">Pig and Poultry Assurance Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>groundwater activities</li>
  <li>water discharge activities</li>
  <li>radioactive substances activities</li>
  <li>flood risk activities</li>
  <li>waste mobile plant</li>
</ul>

<p>Your compliance band is worked out using the compliance rating score you have accumulated over the previous calendar year.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a good compliance record (band A) and are a waste activity or installation you will only pay 95% of the subsistence charge in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>If your record deteriorates you will pay more the following year. If you have a poor compliance record you will pay more than somebody in band A, for example.</p>

<p>For the first year of the new charging scheme, the Environment Agency has worked out compliance rating scores using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opra-for-epr-operational-risk-appraisal">Opra scheme</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about compliance rating see:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span> Mid-year adjustments to subsistence</h3>
<p>This section explains adjustments the Environment Agency will make to subsistence charges if a change takes place partway through a financial year. That is, after the payment due date for the charge has passed.</p>

<p>If you have already paid the subsistence charge in full and a change puts your account into credit, the Environment Agency will refund any money due back to you.</p>

<h4>6.8.1 Effect of revocation, surrender and permit variations</h4>

<p>The subsistence charge will end, or be adjusted proportionally, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Environment Agency revokes your permit</li>
  <li>you surrender or vary your permit</li>
</ul>

<p>The pro rata adjustment will be calculated from the day the change takes place.</p>

<p>Here are some other examples of when pro rata adjustments would be made. In all of these cases, the Environment Agency would make a pro rata adjustment to the subsistence charge from the date on which the change takes place.</p>

<p>When:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a landfill site closes and enters the aftercare phase following a permit variation, the Environment Agency will adjust the subsistence charge on a pro rata basis to the appropriate closed landfill charge reference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a farming installation becomes, or is no longer, a member of the Pig and Poultry Assurance Scheme, the Environment Agency will adjust the subsistence charge on a pro rata basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you no longer qualify for an <abbr title="operator self monitoring">OSM</abbr> discount for your water discharge, the Environment Agency will adjust your subsistence charge on a pro rata basis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an activity becomes exempt from needing a permit, the Environment Agency will adjust the subsistence charge on a pro rata basis â the charge will end on the day the exemption takes effect</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases you must register an exemption to be exempt.</p>

<h4>6.8.2 Stopping activity for more than 12 months</h4>

<p>If you are going to stop operating temporarily, and this is likely to be for more than 12 months (mothballing), the Environment Agency will reduce the subsistence charge by 50%.</p>

<p>This is a temporary measure intended to last for no more than 2 years provided the Environment Agency considers the site to be in âtemporary cessationâ.</p>

<p>You must notify the Environment Agency if you are going to stop activities temporarily for a period of more than 12 months.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency will only reduce the charge if they agree that you meet the criteria for temporary cessation.</p>

<p>For radioactive substances activities, for operations to stop you must have removed from site all:</p>

<ul>
  <li>radioactive materials</li>
  <li>radioactive waste</li>
</ul>

<p>Where operations have stopped for more than 12 months the Environment Agency needs to review activities before they can restart. This is to make sure the site meets the same standards as other competitor operators. For example, to check the site meets the requirements of Best Available Techniques Reference guidance.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency may add an improvement condition to your permit stating that you cannot restart activities until you have submitted the information they need to carry out this review.</p>

<p>You will need to pay a minor variation charge if this improvement condition is added to your permit. The Environment Agency will also charge time and materials for any approvals they need to provide under this permit condition.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.9 </span> Subsistence for multiple activities under one permit</h3>

<p>If you have a permit that covers more than one type of activity your subsistence charge will usually be the sum of the subsistence charge for each of the activities.</p>

<p>There are a number of exceptions, as follows.</p>

<h4>6.9.1 The main activity charge already includes additional activities</h4>

<p>The subsistence charge tables list the subsistence charges for all activities. The descriptions of each activity aim to set out all the activities that are included within that description. If an activity is not included under a description, then it is likely that an additional charge will apply to it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>combustion plants and effluent treatment plants at refineries are considered part of the oil refining activity and so are included in that refinery activity description</li>
  <li>processes and ancillary activities in chemical plants can be unique â a large pharmaceutical manufacturing facility may pay a charge for that activity (table 2.4.5), plus one for additional on-site combustion plant (table 2.10.4), and one for any commercially operated on-site waste treatment activity (table 2.16.1)</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.9.2 Waste treatment</h4>
<p>If any of your activities are listed in table 2.16 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>, you must pay the sum of the highest applicable charge for any:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation in table 2.16</li>
  <li>other waste operation in table 2.16</li>
</ul>

<h4>6.9.3 Water discharge activities and groundwater activities</h4>
<p>Some charging rules have been carried forward from the previous water discharge charging scheme. In particular where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>effluents are joined together for treatment or monitoring before discharge, you pay one charge that reflects the total volume of the effluents</li>
  <li>discharges are infrequent, or seasonally restricted, then discounts may apply</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.10 </span> Standalone directly associated activities on multi-operator installations</h3>
<p>At some industrial installations an operator may apply for a permit for a standalone directly associated activity regulated by the Environment Agency.</p>

<p>This could be because the activity is to be controlled separately to the operation of the main installation by the main operator. The operator of the standalone directly associated activity must have their own permit.</p>

<p>This charge applies where the activity is not a part A(1), part A(2) or part B activity.
.
The operator of the standalone directly associated activity will pay a fixed rate annual subsistence charge of Â£3,926.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.11 </span> Subsistence for local authority installations</h3>
<p>Sometimes the Environment Agency regulates activities normally regulated by local authorities. This may be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are within the boundary of, and serving activities on, an A(1) installation already regulated by the Environment Agency</li>
  <li>the Environment Agency has been given powers to regulate them</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, they could be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>part A(2) bespoke installation</li>
  <li>small waste incineration plant</li>
  <li>part B bespoke installation</li>
</ul>

<p>In these instances the operator will pay the local authority activity annual subsistence charge in table 2.18 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>. This charge will only apply if the activity is not already included in the activity description of the main installation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.12 </span> Additional components for some sectors</h3>

<p>For 2 very diverse process industry sectors, food and drink and pulp and paper, the activity descriptions may include a number of additional components. To find the correct subsistence charge first select the number of additional components on your site from the table in part 4 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>. Then look up the correct charge in table 2.7 or table 2.9.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.13 </span> Flood risk activities subsistence charges</h3>

<p>You need to pay a subsistence charge for all flood risk activity permits. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>The subsistence charge applies for each year there is a compliance check. Normally there will be one compliance check.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency may sometimes need to carry out several compliance checks, for example, where permit conditions apply over a period of time.</p>

<p>If this is the case, the Environment Agency will only charge you once in each financial year for compliance checks. They will invoice you for this charge when they carry out the first compliance check.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.14 </span> Mobile plant permit subsistence and deployment charges</h3>

<p>This section does not apply to mobile radioactive equipment.</p>

<p>Mobile plant permits are different to site based permits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have a simpler permit application process</li>
  <li>surrender is by notification</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you use the plant, you must submit a deployment form for approval by the Environment Agency.</p>

<h4>6.14.1 Annual subsistence charge for mobile plant</h4>

<p>There is an annual subsistence charge of Â£530 for some mobile plant permits that allow the spreading of waste on land. These are in table 2.15 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a>.</p>

<p>This charge covers the costs of reviewing permits and monitoring compliance. Reviews will make sure you have systems in place to prevent incidents and manage your operations well.</p>

<h4>6.14.2 Deployment charges for mobile plant</h4>

<p>Each time you submit a deployment application form you must pay a charge. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">tables of charges</a> for these costs.</p>

<p>You must pay this charge at the same time as you submit the deployment form for assessment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.15 </span> Materials facilities charge</h3>
<p>This charge relates to operators who sort 1,000 tonnes or more a year of mixed dry household waste (or material like household waste) to produce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>glass</li>
  <li>metal</li>
  <li>paper</li>
  <li>plastic recyclate</li>
</ul>

<p>You must sample, record and report the amounts you have processed to the Environment Agency on a quarterly basis. The Environment Agency will carry out inspections, assess your compliance and, if necessary, take enforcement action.</p>

<p>The charge covers additional regulatory costs specific to the regulations and is in addition to the annual subsistence charge for the permit.</p>

<p>The charge will be raised annually in arrears on a calendar year basis.</p>

<p>The charge is Â£2,240.</p>

<p>You may withdraw notifications at any time if you consider that your facility is no longer likely to qualify for the regulation and charge. Where a notification is withdrawn, charges will terminate from the start of the reporting period immediately following the date of receipt of the withdrawal notice.</p>

<p>No refunds will be made for notified periods.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span> How to pay for charges</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Payments for applications</h3>
<p>When you send an application to the Environment Agency you need to pay the application charge when you apply. For example this could be an application:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a new permit, licence or registration</li>
  <li>to vary or surrender an existing permit</li>
</ul>

<p>Send the application paperwork to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

<p>You can pay application charges by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cheque</li>
  <li>credit or debit card (not American Express)</li>
  <li>electronic transfer (for example BACS or CHAPS)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to pay by credit or debit card let the Environment Agency know and they will contact you when they receive your application.</p>

<p>Include an Environment Agency reference number or permit number with your payment, particularly if you are making an electronic payment. This will make sure your payment can be identified and matched to your application.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Other payments</h3>
<p>This applies to payments for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subsistence charges</li>
  <li>time and materials charges</li>
  <li>additional fixed application or subsistence charges</li>
</ul>

<p>For these types of charges the Environment Agency will send an invoice to the person and contact address you provided.</p>

<p>You can pay by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>credit or debit card (not American Express)</li>
  <li>electronic transfer (for example BACS or CHAPS)</li>
  <li>bank giro credit</li>
  <li>direct debit â for subsistence charges</li>
</ul>

<p>Full details on how to make your payment can be found on the back of your invoice.</p>

<p>Include an Environment Agency reference number or permit number with your payment, particularly if you are making an electronic payment. This will make sure your payment can be identified and matched to your invoice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> If you do not pay a charge</h3>

<p>If an application is received without the correct payment it cannot be classified as âduly madeâ and so cannot be processed (determined).</p>

<p>If you have not paid the full application charge, the Environment Agency will ask you to pay the balance. They cannot determine the application and will not issue a new or revised permit if any part of an application charge is missing.</p>

<p>If you do not pay the subsistence charge when it is due, the Environment Agency may revoke or suspend your permit and take action to recover the debt.</p>

<p>If the Environment Agency has varied your permit and you do not pay the variation charge, they will take action to recover the debt.</p>

<p>If you have not paid the charges for a discretionary service requested by you, the Environment Agency may refuse to provide any more discretionary services until payment is received.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Reducing a charge</h3>

<p>The Environment Agency can make an âabatement decisionâ to waive or reduce any charge listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-permits-and-abstraction-licences-tables-of-charges">The Environment Agency (Environmental Permitting and Abstraction Licensing) (England) Charging Scheme 2022</a> (part 1 paragraph 5). They may do this in cases where they think that the charge is significantly disproportionate when compared to the costs they have incurred or will incur.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Complaints about charges</h3>

<p>If you wish to complain about your charges, or ask the Environment Agency to review a decision they have made about your charges, please see their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/complaints-procedure">complaints procedure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> When charges are due</h3>

<p>You must provide payment with your application when you apply for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new permits</li>
  <li>variations</li>
  <li>transfers</li>
  <li>surrenders</li>
</ul>

<p>Invoices for a permit variation made by the Environment Agency must be paid when the invoice is issued. Fixed and time and materials charges for work to determine an application must be paid when the invoice is issued.</p>

<p>Other time and materials charges are normally invoiced in arrears.</p>

<p>Invoices for subsistence charges are issued annually on 1 April and must be paid when you receive the invoice. Or, in the first year the permit is granted, you will receive a pro rata invoice when your permit is issued. You must pay this when you receive the invoice.</p>

<p>You must pay the deployment application charge when you send in the notification for each deployment.</p>
