<h2>Annex B: COVID Winter Grant Scheme Determination 2020 grant conditions</h2>

<p>1. In this Annex and <a href="#annex-c" class="govuk-link">Annex C</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘the Scheme’ means the use by the authority of as much of the grant money identified in <a href="#annex-a" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a> as it deems necessary to provide support over the winter to children and households who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, poverty, where they are impacted by the ongoing public health emergency, and where alternative sources of assistance may be unavailable</li>
  <li>‘the Department’ means the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>)</li>
  <li>‘the authority’ means any local authority listed in <a href="#annex-a" class="govuk-link">Annex A</a>
</li>
  <li>‘the Secretary of State’ means the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</li>
  <li>‘the period’ means the period of time from 1 December 2020 to 31 March 2021</li>
</ul>

<p>2. The grant is only paid to the authority to support eligible expenditure (see paragraphs 4 to 7 below).</p>

<p>3. The authority must have regard to any guidance issued by the Department or sources of information and data available to it that may assist in the decision-making regarding the Scheme.</p>

<h3>Eligible expenditure</h3>

<p>4. Eligible expenditure means payments made, or committed to, by the authority or any person acting on behalf of the authority, during the period, under the Scheme.</p>

<p>5. Unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise (for all authorities or any one authority), the authority must determine individual eligibility in its area for assistance under the Scheme and the means by which assistance will be provided (whether directly by the authority or through a third party) and target its support as follows:</p>

<p>(a) the authority must ensure that:</p>

<p><sup>(i)</sup> at least 80% of the grant is allocated to support households that include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a person who will be under the age of 19 as at 31 March 2021, or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a person aged 19 or over in respect of whom a child-related benefit is paid or free school meals are provided during the period, and</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><sup>(ii)</sup> up to 20% of the grant is used to assist other households, and</p>

<p>(b) the authority must ensure that:</p>

<p><sup>(i)</sup> at least 80% of the grant is allocated to support with food, energy costs (for heating, lighting and cooking) and water costs (for household purposes, including sewerage), and</p>

<p><sup>(ii)</sup> up to 20% of the grant is allocated to support with other essential expenditure related to food, heating, lighting, cooking, water and sewerage needs, but excluding rent or other housing costs.</p>

<p>6. If the authority or any third party incurs any of the following costs, they must be excluded from eligible expenditure:</p>

<p>a) contributions in kind,</p>

<p>b) payments for activities of a political or exclusively religious nature,</p>

<p>c) depreciation, amortisation or impairment of fixed assets,</p>

<p>d) input VAT reclaimable from HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>),</p>

<p>e) interest payments or service charge payments for finance leases,</p>

<p>f) gifts, other than promotional items with a value of no more than £10 in a year to any one person,</p>

<p>g) entertaining (entertaining for this purpose means anything that would be a taxable benefit to the person being entertained, according to current UK tax regulations), or</p>

<p>h) statutory fines, criminal fines or penalties.</p>

<p>and, for the avoidance of doubt, the exclusions at a) and f) above do not apply to the provision of direct assistance, including food, to the intended eligible beneficiaries of the Scheme.</p>

<p>7. The authority must not deliberately incur liabilities for eligible expenditure before there is an operational need for it to do so.</p>

<h3>Payment arrangements</h3>

<p>8. The grant will be paid according to the profile attached at <a href="#annex-c" class="govuk-link">Annex C</a>.</p>

<p>9. If at any time the authority becomes aware that the above profile no longer reflects the pattern of eligible expenditure during the period, the authority must inform the Department as soon as possible. The Secretary of State reserves the right to alter the timing or amount of grant payments accordingly.</p>

<h3>Statement of Grant Usage</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The authority must prepare a Statement of Grant Usage:</li>
</ol>

<p>a) from the start of the period to 31 January 2021 inclusive to be submitted to the Department on or before 14 February 2021, and</p>

<p>b) for the remainder of the period to be submitted to the Department on or before 21 April 2021.</p>

<p>The Statement of Grant Usage must be in the form agreed between the authority and the Department and must provide details of eligible expenditure in the relevant period. The Statement of Grant Usage must be certified by the authority’s Section 151 officer, to the best of the officer’s knowledge, that the amounts shown on the statement are all eligible expenditure and that the grant has been used for the purposes intended.</p>

<p>11. If the Statement of Grant Usage identifies any overpayment of grant, the authority must, unless offset by the Department in the next payment, repay this amount within 30 days of being asked by the Department.</p>

<p>12. The Secretary of State may at any time require a further external validation to be carried out by officers of the Department or an appropriately qualified independent accountant or auditor, on the use of the grant.</p>

<h3>Progress report and management information return</h3>

<p>13. The authority must provide a progress report and management information return with each Statement of Grant Usage in relation to the time periods, and on or before the dates, specified in paragraph 10 in accordance with the guidance issued by the Department.</p>

<h3>Financial management</h3>

<p>14. The authority must maintain a sound system of internal financial controls.</p>

<p>15. If the authority has any grounds for suspecting financial irregularity in the use of any grant paid under this Determination, it must notify the Department immediately, explain what steps are being taken to investigate the suspicion and keep the Department informed about the progress of the investigation. For these purposes ‘financial irregularity’ includes fraud or other impropriety, mismanagement, and the use of grant for purposes other than those for which it was provided.</p>

<h3>Records to be kept</h3>

<p>16. The authority must maintain reliable, accessible and up to date accounting records with an adequate audit trail for all expenditure funded by grant monies under this Determination.</p>

<p>17. The authority and any person acting on behalf of the authority must allow:</p>

<p>a) the Comptroller and Auditor General or appointed representatives, or</p>

<p>b) the Secretary of State or appointed representatives,</p>

<p>free access at all reasonable times to all documents (including computerised documents and data) and other information as are connected to the grant payable under this Determination, or to the purposes for which grant was used, subject to the provisions in paragraph 18.</p>

<p>18. The documents, data and information referred to in paragraph 17 are such which the Secretary of State or the Comptroller and Auditor General may reasonably require for the purposes of ‘spot checking’ administrative costs or significant amounts paid under the Scheme or a financial audit of any department or other public body or for carrying out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which any department or other public body has used its resources. The authority must provide such further explanations as are reasonably required for these purposes.</p>

<p>19. Paragraphs 17 and 18 do not constitute a requirement for the examination, certification or inspection of the accounts of the Authority by the Comptroller and Auditor General under section 6(3) of the National Audit Act 1983. The Secretary of State and Comptroller and Auditor General will seek access in a measured manner to minimise any burden on the authority and will avoid duplication of effort by seeking and sharing information with local auditors.</p>

<h3>Breach of conditions and recovery of grant</h3>

<p>20. If the authority fails to comply with any of these conditions, or if any overpayment is made under this grant or any amount is paid in error, or if any of the events set out in paragraph 21 occurs, the Secretary of State may reduce, suspend or withhold grant payments or require the repayment of the whole or any part of the grant monies paid, as may be determined by the Secretary of State and notified in writing to the authority. Such sum as has been notified will immediately become repayable to the Secretary of State who may set off the sum against any future amount due to the authority from central government.</p>

<p>21. The events referred to in paragraph 20 are:</p>

<p>a) the authority purports to transfer or assign any rights, interests or obligations arising under this Determination without the prior agreement of the Secretary of State,</p>

<p>b) any information provided in any application for grant monies payable under this Determination, or in any subsequent supporting correspondence is found to be significantly incorrect or incomplete in the opinion of the Secretary of State,</p>

<p>c) it appears to the Secretary of State that other circumstances have arisen or events have occurred that are likely to significantly affect the authority’s ability to deliver the Scheme,</p>

<p>d) the authority’s Section 151 officer is unable to provide reasonable assurance that the Statement of Grant Usage, in all material respects, fairly presents the eligible expenditure in the period in accordance with the definitions and conditions in this Determination, or</p>

<p>e) the authority fails to provide the Statement of Grant Usage and a progress report and management information return by the date(s) specified in paragraph 10.</p>

<h2>Annex C: Payment arrangements</h2>

<p>The payments will be made to the authority in three instalments as follows:</p>

<p>a) 50% at the start of the period</p>

<p>b) 25% at the end of February 2021 subject to any offsetting in accordance with paragraph 20 of <a href="#annex-b" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a> following receipt of the first Statement of Grant Usage and progress report and management information return, and</p>

<p>c) 25% in April or May 2021 subject to any offsetting in accordance with paragraph 20 of <a href="#annex-b" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a> following receipt of the second Statement of Grant Usage and progress report and management information return.</p>
