<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What Paxlovid is and what it is used for</h2>

<p>Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine used for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
COVID-19 is caused by a virus. Paxlovid stops the virus multiplying in cells and this stops the virus multiplying in the body. This can help your body to overcome the virus infection, and may help you get better faster.</p>

<p>Paxlovid contains the active substances PF-07321332 and ritonavir. PF-07321332 is active against the virus that causes COVID-19. Ritonavir prolongs the therapeutic effect of PF-07321332.</p>

<p>Paxlovid is used in adults 18 years of age and older with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. It is only used in patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID 19, including hospitalisation or death.</p>

<p>You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse while on treatment with Paxlovid.</p>

<p>Many medicines interact with Paxlovid. Keep a list of your medicines to show your doctor and pharmacist. Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your doctor. Your doctor can tell you if it is safe to take Paxlovid with other medicines.</p>

<h3>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility</h3>

<p>Paxlovid is not recommended during pregnancy. There is not enough information to be sure that Paxlovid is safe for use in pregnancy and it is not known if Paxlovid will harm your baby while you are pregnant.</p>

<p>If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice. If you can become pregnant, it is recommended that you refrain from sexual activity or use effective barrier contraception while taking Paxlovid and until after one full menstrual cycle is completed after stopping Paxlovid treatment.</p>

<p>If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breastfeed, tell your healthcare provider before taking this medicine. Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment and for 7 days after the last dose of Paxlovid. This is because it is not known if Paxlovid gets into breast milk and will be passed to the baby.</p>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>

<p>Paxlovid has not been specifically tested for its possible effects on the ability to drive a car or operate machines.</p>

<h3>Paxlovid contains lactose (a type of sugar)</h3>

<p>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product.</p>

<h3>Information on sodium content</h3>

<p>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially âsodium freeâ.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How to take Paxlovid</h2>

<p>Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p>

<p>If you have kidney disease, please talk to your healthcare provider for an appropriate dose of Paxlovid. If you have moderate kidney disease you will need a lower dose of Paxlovid. If you have severe kidney disease you must not take Paxlovid.</p>

<p>Paxlovid consists of 2 medicines: PF-07321332 and ritonavir. The recommended dose is 2 tablets of PF-07321332 with 1 tablet of ritonavir by mouth twice daily (in the morning and at night). The blister foil for each day of treatment is divided in two different coloured sections to indicate which tablets need to be taken at each time of day â one side for the morning (AM) dose and the other side for the evening (PM) dose.</p>

<p>A course of treatment lasts 5 days. For each dose, take all 3 tablets together at the same time.</p>

<p>Swallow the tablets whole. Do not chew, break or crush the tablets. Paxlovid can be taken with or without meals.</p>

<h3>Use in children and adolescents</h3>

<p>Paxlovid is not used to treat children and adolescents (under 18 years old).</p>

<h3>If you take more Paxlovid than you should</h3>

<p>If you take too much Paxlovid, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.</p>

<h3>If you forget to take Paxlovid</h3>

<p>If you forget to take a dose of Paxlovid, take it as soon as you remember. If more than 8 hours have passed since your missed dose, then do not take the missed dose and just carry on as before.</p>

<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.</p>

<h3>If you feel better</h3>

<p>Even if you feel better, do not stop taking Paxlovid without talking to your healthcare provider.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>	Possible side effects</h2>

<h4>Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Diarrhoea</li>
  <li>Vomiting</li>
  <li>Altered sense of taste</li>
</ul>
