<h2>Summary of Product Characteristics</h2>

<p>This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://draft-origin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-paxlovid/summary-of-product-characteristics-for-paxlovid#undesirable-effects" rel="external">section 4.8</a> for how to report adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Name of the medicinal product</h2>

<p>Paxlovid 150 mg/100 mg film-coated tablets</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Qualitative and quantitative composition</h2>

<p>Each pink PF 07321332 film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of PF 07321332.</p>

<p>Each white ritonavir film-coated tablet contains 100 mg of ritonavir.</p>

<h4>Excipients with known effect</h4>

<p>Each PF-07321332 150 mg film-coated tablet contains 176 mg of lactose.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Pharmaceutical form</h2>

<h4>PF 07321332</h4>

<p>Film-coated tablet (tablet).</p>

<p>Pink, oval, with a dimension of approximately 17.6 mm in length and 8.6 mm in width debossed with âPFEâ on one side and â3CLâ on the other side.</p>

<h4>Ritonavir</h4>

<p>Film-coated tablet (tablet).</p>

<p>White to off white, capsule shaped tablets, with a dimension of approximately 17.1 mm in length and 9.1 mm in width, debossed with âHâ on one side and âR9â on other side.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Clinical particulars</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Therapeutic indications</h3>

<p>Paxlovid is indicated for the treatment of COVID 19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progression to severe COVID 19 (see section 5.1).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Posology and method of administration</h3>

<p>Paxlovid is PF-07321332 tablets co-packaged with ritonavir tablets.</p>

<p>PF-07321332 must be coadministered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly coadminister PF 07321332 with ritonavir will result in plasma concentrations of PF-07321332 that will be insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.</p>

<h4>Posology</h4>

<p>The recommended dosage is 300 mg PF 07321332 (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) all taken together orally twice daily for 5 days. Paxlovid should be given as soon as possible after positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and within 5 days of onset of symptoms.</p>

<p>Paxlovid can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, broken or crushed.</p>

<p>A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible and within 8 hours of the scheduled time, and the normal dosing schedule should be resumed. If more than 8 hours has elapsed, the missed dose should not be taken and the treatment should resume according to the normal dosing schedule.</p>

<p>If a patient requires hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19 after starting treatment with Paxlovid, the patient should complete the full 5-day treatment course at the discretion of his/her healthcare provider.</p>

<h3>Special populations</h3>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The safety and efficacy of Paxlovid in paediatric patients younger than 18 years of age have not yet been established.</p>

<h4>Elderly</h4>

<p>No dose adjustment is currently recommended for elderly patients.</p>

<h4>Renal impairment</h4>

<p>No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment.</p>

<p>In patients with moderate renal impairment, the dose of Paxlovid should be reduced to PF 07321332/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg (1 tablet of each) twice daily for 5 days. The remaining tablet of PF 07321332 should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see section 6.6).</p>

<p>Paxlovid is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment or with renal failure as the appropriate dose has not yet been determined (see section 5.2).</p>

<h4>Hepatic impairment</h4>

<p>No dosage adjustment of Paxlovid is needed for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment.
No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of PF-07321332 or ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, Paxlovid is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Concomitant therapy with ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen
No dose adjustment is needed; the dose of Paxlovid is 300 mg/100 mg twice daily for 5 days. 
Patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are receiving ritonavir- or cobicistat-containing regimen should continue their treatment as indicated.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Contraindications</h3>

<p>Paxlovid is contraindicated in patients: 
* with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to the active substances (PF 07321332/ritonavir) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
* with severe hepatic impairment.
* with severe renal impairment.</p>

<p>Paxlovid is also contraindicated with medicinal products that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions. Paxlovid is also contraindicated with medicinal products that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced plasma PF-07321332/ritonavir concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance.</p>

<p><sup>a</sup>See section 5.2, Interaction studies conducted with PF-07321332/ritonavir.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Special warnings and precautions for use</h3>

<p>Risk of serious adverse reactions due to interactions with other medicinal products</p>

<p>Initiation of Paxlovid, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A or initiation of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A in patients already receiving Paxlovid, may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP3A.</p>

<p>Initiation of medicinal products that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of Paxlovid, respectively.</p>

<p>These interactions may lead to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicinal products.</li>
  <li>Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of Paxlovid.</li>
  <li>Loss of therapeutic effect of Paxlovid and possible development of viral resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>See Table 1 for medicinal products that are contraindicated for concomitant use with PF 07321332/ritonavir (see section 4.3) and Table 2 for potentially significant interactions with other medicinal products (see section 4.5). Potential for interactions should be considered with other medicinal products prior to and during Paxlovid therapy; concomitant medicinal products should be reviewed during Paxlovid therapy and the patient should be monitored for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medicinal products. The risk of interactions with concomitant medications during the 5-day treatment period for Paxlovid should be weighed against the risk of not receiving Paxlovid.</p>

<h4>Hepatotoxicity</h4>

<p>Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering Paxlovid to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities or hepatitis.</p>

<h4>HIV resistance</h4>

<p>As PF-07321332 is coadministered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.</p>

<h4>Excipients</h4>

<p>PF-07321332 tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.</p>

<p>PF-07321332 and ritonavir tablets each contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially âsodium freeâ.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction</h3>

<p>Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir) is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that are extensively metabolised by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in exposure when coadministered with PF 07321332/ritonavir. Thus, coadministration of PF-07321332/ritonavir with medicinal products highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life threatening events is contraindicated (see Table 1, section 4.3).</p>

<p>In vitro study results showed PF-07321332 may be inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. The clinical relevance is unknown. Based on in vitro data, PF-07321332 has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B3 and OCT2. There is a potential for PF 07321332 to inhibit MDR1, MATE1, OCT1 and OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations.</p>

<p>Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 &gt; CYP2D6. Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P glycoprotein (P-gp) and may inhibit this transporter. Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.</p>

<p>Coadministration of other CYP3A4 substrates that may lead to potentially significant interaction should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks (see Table 2).</p>

<p>PF 07321332/ritonavir is a CYP3A substrate; therefore, medicinal products that induce CYP3A may decrease plasma concentrations of PF 07321332 and ritonavir and reduce Paxlovid therapeutic effect.</p>

<p>Medicinal products listed in Table 1 (section 4.3) and Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible medicinal products that may interact with PF-07321332/ritonavir. The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information.</p>

Plasma concentrations of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher when midazolam is given orally. Therefore, Paxlovid should not be coadministered with orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with coadministration of Paxlovid and parenteral midazolam. Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggests a possible 3 â 4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels. If Paxlovid is coadministered with parenteral midazolam, it should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment for midazolam should be considered, especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered.</td>

<span class="number">4.6 </span> Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h3>

<h4>Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females</h4>

<p>There are no human data on the use of Paxlovid during pregnancy to inform the drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes, women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with Paxlovid.</p>

<p>Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Patients using combined hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception during treatment and until after one complete menstrual cycle after stopping Paxlovid (see section 4.5).</p>

<h4>Pregnancy</h4>

<p>There are no data from the use of Paxlovid in pregnant women. Paxlovid is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.</p>

<p>There was no PF-07321332-related effect on foetal morphology or embryo-foetal viability at any dose tested in rat or rabbit embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies (see section 5.3).</p>

<p>A large number of pregnant women were exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy. These data largely refer to exposures where ritonavir was used in combination therapy and not at therapeutic ritonavir doses but at lower doses as a pharmacokinetic enhancer for other protease inhibitors, similar to the ritonavir dose used for PF 07321332/ritonavir. These data indicate no increase in the rate of birth defects compared to rates observed in population-based birth defect surveillance systems. Animal data with ritonavir have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).</p>

<h4>Breast-feeding</h4>

<p>There are no human data on the use of Paxlovid in breast-feeding.</p>

<p>It is unknown whether PF-07321332 is excreted in human or animal milk, and the effects of it on the breast fed newborn/infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breast-fed newborn/infant or the effects of the medicinal product on milk production. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Breast feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Paxlovid and for 7 days after the last dose of Paxlovid.</p>

<h4>Fertility</h4>

<p>There are no human data on the effect of Paxlovid on fertility. No human data on the effect of PF 07321332 on fertility are available. PF 07321332 produced no effects on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).</p>

<p>There are no human data on the effect of ritonavir on fertility. Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats.</p>

<h4>Summary of the safety profile</h4>

<p>The safety of Paxlovid is based on data from Study C4671005 (EPIC-HR), a Phase 2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled trial in non hospitalised adult participants with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (see section 5.1). A total of 1,349 symptomatic adult participants 18 years of age and older who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness received at least one dose of either Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) (n=672) or placebo (n=677). Study drugs were to be taken twice daily for up to 5 days.</p>

<p>Adverse reactions in the Paxlovid group (â¥ 1%) that occurred at a greater frequency than in the placebo group were diarrhoea (3.9% and 1.9%, respectively), vomiting (1.3% and 0.3%) and dysgeusia (4.8% and 0.1%).</p>

<h4>Tabulated summary of adverse reactions</h4>

<p>The adverse reactions in Table 3 are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: Very common (â¥ 1/10); common (â¥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (â¥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (â¥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).</p>

<h4>Paediatric population</h4>

<p>The safety and efficacy of Paxlovid in paediatric patients have not been established.</p>

<h4>Reporting of suspected adverse reactions</h4>

<p>Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card Reporting site</a> or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> Overdose</h3>

<p>Treatment of overdose with Paxlovid should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with Paxlovid.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Pharmacological properties</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Pharmacodynamic properties</h3>

<p>Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: not yet assigned.</p>

<h4>Mechanism of action</h4>

<p>PF-07321332 is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the coronavirus 3C-like (3CL) protease, including the SARS CoV 2 3CL protease. Inhibition of the 3CL protease renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication. PF-07321332 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2 3CL protease (Ki=0.00311 Î¼M or IC50=0.0192 ÂµM) in a biochemical enzymatic assay.</p>

<p>Ritonavir is not active against SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of PF-07321332, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of PF-07321332.</p>

<h4>Antiviral activity</h4>

<h4>In vitro antiviral activity</h4>
<p>PF-07321332 exhibited antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection of dNHBE cells, a primary human lung alveolar epithelial cell line (EC90 value of 181 nM) after Day 3 postâinfection.</p>

<h4>In vivo antiviral activity</h4>
<p>PF-07321332 showed antiviral activity in mouse models with mouse-adapted SAR-CoV-2 infection in BALB/c and 129 mouse strains. Oral administration of PF-07321332 at 300 mg/kg or 1,000 mg/kg twice daily initiated 4 hours post-inoculation or 1,000 mg/kg twice daily initiated 12 hours post inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 MA10 resulted in reduction of lung viral titres and ameliorated indicators of disease (weight loss and lung pathology) compared to placebo-treated animals.</p>

<h4>Antiviral resistance</h4>
<p>Because PF-07321332 is coadministered with low dose ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV 1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV 1 infection.</p>

<h4>Pharmacodynamic effects</h4>

<h4>Cardiac electrophysiology</h4>
<p>No clinically relevant effect of PF-07321332 on QTcF interval was observed in a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 10 healthy adults. The model predicted upper bound of 90% confidence interval (CI) for baseline and ritonavir adjusted QTcF estimate was 1.96 ms at approximately 4-fold higher concentration than the mean steady-state peak concentration after a therapeutic dose of PF 07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg.</p>

<p>Clinical efficacy and safety</p>

<p>The efficacy of Paxlovid is based on the interim analysis of EPIC HR, a Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in non hospitalised symptomatic adult participants with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants with COVID-19 symptom onset of â¤ 5 days were included in the study. Participants were randomised (1:1) to receive Paxlovid (PF-07321332 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days. The study excluded individuals with a history of prior COVID-19 infection or vaccination. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28 in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (all treated participants with onset of symptoms â¤ 3 days who had at least one post-baseline visit). Secondary efficacy endpoints included assessments of COVID 19 hospitalisation or death from any cause through Day 28 in the mITT1 analysis set (all treated participants with onset of symptoms â¤ 5 days who had at least one post-baseline visit).</p>

<p>A total of 1,361 participants were randomised to receive either Paxlovid or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 45 years; 52% were male; 63% were White, 5% were Black, 48% were Hispanic or Latino and 20% were Asian; 63% of participants had onset of symptoms â¤ 3 days from initiation of study treatment; 44% of participants were serological negative at baseline. The most frequently reported risk factors were BMI â¥ 25 kg/m2 (1080 [79.4%] participants), tobacco use (501 [36.8%] participants), hypertension (441 [32.4%] participants), age â¥ 60 years (255 [18.7%] participants), and diabetes mellitus (175 [12.9%] participants). Other risk factors were cardiovascular disorder (50 [3.7%] participants), chronic kidney disease (8 [0.6%] participants), chronic lung disease (67 [4.9%] participants), immunosuppression (12 [0.9%] participants), cancer (4 [0.3%] participants), neurodevelopmental disorders (2 [0.1%] participants), HIV infection (1 [&lt;0.1%] participant) and device dependency (5 [0.4%] participants). The mean (SD) baseline viral load was 4.71 log10 copies/mL (2.78); 27% of participants had a baseline viral load of &gt; 10^7 (units); 8.2% of participants either received or were expected to receive COVID-19 therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatment at the time of randomisation and were excluded from the mITT and mITT1 analyses.</p>

<p>The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the Paxlovid and placebo groups.</p>

<p>At time of the interim analysis, 389 participants in the Paxlovid group and 385 participants in the placebo group were included in the mITT analysis set. Paxlovid significantly reduced (p&lt;0.0001) the proportion of participants with COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death through Day 28 by 89.1%, compared with placebo, in adult participants with symptom onset â¤ 3 days who were at increased risk of progression to severe disease. No deaths were reported in the Paxlovid group compared with 7 deaths in the placebo group. The proportions of participants who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2.4% in the Paxlovid group and 4.3% in the placebo group.</p>

<p>Similar trends have been observed for the primary efficacy analysis across subgroups of participants. Table 4 presents the results of the primary endpoint in the mITT analysis population and in the subgroups by baseline viral load, serology status or age.</p>

<p>An interim assessment of the effect of Paxlovid on viral load (copies/mL) relative to placebo was conducted. A total of 572 participants with a detectable baseline viral load were included in the interim assessment, and change from baseline to Day 5 (end of treatment) was evaluated. At Day 5, after accounting for baseline viral load level, geographic region, serology status, and symptom onset, the adjusted mean change in viral load (log10 copies/mL) from baseline showed an additional reduction of 0.93 log10 (copies/mL) in the Paxlovid group relative to placebo. The additional viral load reduction from Paxlovid treatment relative to placebo was more apparent among participants who were seronegative or had high viral load level at baseline. Similarly, among participants with symptom onset â¤ 3 days, a reduction of 1.03 log10 (copies/mL) was shown in the Paxlovid group relative to placebo at Day 5.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Pharmacokinetic properties</h3>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332/ritonavir have been studied in healthy participants.</p>

<p>Ritonavir is administered with PF-07321332 as a pharmacokinetic enhancer resulting in higher systemic concentrations of PF-07321332. In healthy participants in the fasted state, the mean half-life (t1/2) of a single dose of 150 mg PF 07321332 administered alone was approximately 2 hours compared to 7 hours after administration of a single dose of 250 mg/100 mg PF-07321332/ritonavir thereby supporting a twice daily administration regimen.</p>

<p>Upon administration of single dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 250 mg/100 mg to healthy participants in the fasted state, the geometric mean (CV%) maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the time of last measurement (AUClast) was 2.88 ug/mL (25%) and 27.6 ug*hr/mL (13%), respectively. Upon repeat-dose of PF-07321332/ritonavir 75 mg/100 mg, 250 mg/100 mg, and 500 mg/100 mg administered twice daily, the increase in systemic exposure at steady-state appears to be less than dose proportional. Multiple dosing over 10 days achieved steady-state on Day 2 with approximately 2-fold accumulation. Systemic exposures on Day 5 were similar to Day 10 across all doses.</p>

<h4>Absorption</h4>

<p>Following oral administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean PF-07321332 (CV%) Cmax and area under the plasma concentration time curve from 0 to infinity (AUCinf) at steady-state was 2.21 Âµg/mL (33) and 23.01 Âµg*hr/mL (23), respectively. The median (range) time to Cmax (Tmax) was 3.00 hrs (1.02-6.00). The arithmetic mean (+SD) terminal elimination half-life was 6.1 (1.8) hours.</p>

<p>Following oral administration of PF-07321332/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg after a single dose, the geometric mean ritonavir (CV%) Cmax and AUCinf was 0.36 Âµg/mL (46) and 3.60 Âµg*hr/mL (47), respectively. The median (range) time to Cmax (Tmax) was 3.98 hrs (1.48-4.20). The arithmetic mean (+SD) terminal elimination half-life was 6.1 (2.2) hours.</p>

<h4>Effect of food on oral absorption</h4>
<p>Dosing with a high fat meal modestly increased the exposure of PF-07321332 (approximately 15% increase in mean Cmax and 1.6% increase in mean AUClast) relative to fasting conditions following administration of a suspension formulation of PF-07321332 coadministered with ritonavir tablets.</p>

<h4>Distribution</h4>

<p>The protein binding of PF-07321332 in human plasma is approximately 69%.</p>

<p>The protein binding of ritonavir in human plasma is approximately 98-99%.</p>

<h4>Biotransformation</h4>

<p>In vitro studies assessing PF-07321332 without concomitant ritonavir suggest that PF-07321332 is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. PF-07321332 does not reversibly inhibit CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, or CYP1A2 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro study results showed PF-07321332 may be inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. The clinical relevance is unknown. Based on in vitro data, PF-07321332 has a low potential to inhibit BCRP, MATE2K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B3 and OCT2. There is a potential for PF-07321332 to inhibit MDR1, MATE1, OCT1 and OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Administration of PF-07321332 with ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of PF-07321332. In plasma, the only drug-related entity observed was unchanged PF 07321332. Minor oxidative metabolites were observed in the faeces and urine.</p>

<p>In vitro studies utilising human liver microsomes have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is the major isoform involved in ritonavir metabolism, although CYP2D6 also contributes to the formation of oxidation metabolite Mâ2.</p>

<p>Low doses of ritonavir have shown profound effects on the pharmacokinetics of other protease inhibitors (and other products metabolised by CYP3A4) and other protease inhibitors may influence the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir.</p>

<p>Ritonavir has a high affinity for several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms and may inhibit oxidation with the following ranked order: CYP3A4 &gt; CYP2D6. Ritonavir also has a high affinity for P glycoprotein (P-gp) and may inhibit this transporter. Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal products metabolised by these pathways and may result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect.</p>

<h4>Elimination</h4>

<p>The primary route of elimination of PF-07321332 when administered with ritonavir was renal excretion of intact drug. Approximately 49.6% and 35.3% of the administered dose of PF 07321332 300 mg was recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. PF-07321332 was the predominant drug related entity with small amounts of metabolites arising from hydrolysis reactions in excreta. In plasma, the only drug-related entity quantifiable was unchanged PF-07321332.</p>

<p>Human studies with radiolabelled ritonavir demonstrated that the elimination of ritonavir was primarily via the hepatobiliary system; approximately 86% of radiolabel was recovered from stool, part of which is expected to be unabsorbed ritonavir.</p>

<h4>Specific populations</h4>

<p>The pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332/ritonavir based on age and gender have not been evaluated.</p>

<h4>Racial or ethnic groups</h4>
<p>Systemic exposure in Japanese participants was numerically lower but not clinically meaningfully different than those in Western participants.</p>

<h4>Patients with renal impairment</h4>
<p>Compared to healthy controls with no renal impairment, the Cmax and AUC of PF-07321332 in patients with mild renal impairment was 30% and 24% higher, in patients with moderate renal impairment was 38% and 87% higher, and in patients with severe renal impairment was 48% and 204% higher, respectively.</p>

<h4>Patients with hepatic impairment</h4>
<p>Compared to healthy controls with no hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment was not significantly different.</p>

<h4>Interaction studies conducted with PF-07321332/ritonavir</h4>

<p>CYP3A4 was the major contributor to the oxidative metabolism of PF-07321332, when PF-07321332 was tested alone in human liver microsomes. Ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and increases plasma concentrations of PF-07321332 and other drugs that are primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Despite being coadministered with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, there is potential for strong inhibitors and inducers to alter the pharmacokinetics of PF-07321332.</p>

<p>The effects of coadministration of Paxlovid with itraconazole (CYP3A inhibitor) and carbamazepine (CYP3A inducer) on the PF-07321332 AUC and Cmax are summarised in Table 7 (effect of other medicinal products on PF-07321332).</p>

<span class="number">5.3 </span> Preclinical safety data</h3>

<h4>Toxicology</h4>

<p>Repeat dose toxicity studies up to 1 month duration of PF-07321332 in rats and monkeys resulted in no adverse findings.</p>

<p>Repeat-dose toxicity studies of ritonavir in animals identified major target organs as the liver, retina, thyroid gland and kidney. Hepatic changes involved hepatocellular, biliary and phagocytic elements and were accompanied by increases in hepatic enzymes. Hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal degeneration have been seen in all of the rodent studies conducted with ritonavir, but have not been seen in dogs. Ultrastructural evidence suggests that these retinal changes may be secondary to phospholipidosis. However, clinical trials revealed no evidence of medicinal product-induced ocular changes in humans. All thyroid changes were reversible upon discontinuation of ritonavir. Clinical investigation in humans has revealed no clinically significant alteration in thyroid function tests.</p>

<p>Renal changes including tubular degeneration, chronic inflammation and proteinurea were noted in rats and are felt to be attributable to species-specific spontaneous disease. Furthermore, no clinically significant renal abnormalities were noted in clinical trials.</p>

<h4>Carcinogenesis</h4>

<p>Paxlovid has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity.</p>

<p>PF 07321332 has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity.</p>

<p>Long-term carcinogenicity studies of ritonavir in mice and rats revealed tumorigenic potential specific for these species, but are regarded as of no relevance for humans.</p>

<h4>Mutagenesis</h4>

<p>Paxlovid has not been evaluated for the potential to cause mutagenicity.</p>

<p>PF 07321332 was not genotoxic in a battery of assays, including bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and in vivo rat micronucleus assays.</p>

<p>Ritonavir was found to be negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes.</p>

<h4>Reproductive toxicity</h4>

<h4>PF 07321332</h4>

<p>In a fertility and early embryonic development study, PF 07321332 was administered to male and female rats by oral gavage at doses of 60, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg/day once daily beginning 14 days prior to mating, throughout the mating phase, and continued through Gestation Day (GD) 6 for females and for a total of 32 doses for males. There were no effects on fertility, reproductive performance, or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day representing 12x/4.3x based on the predicted human Cmax/AUC24 at a twice-daily dose of 300 mg/100 mg PF 07321332/ritonavir.</p>

<p>The potential embryo-foetal toxicity of PF-07321332 was evaluated in the definitive rat and rabbit studies at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. There was no PF 07321332-related effect in any of the parameters in the rat embryo-foetal development (EFD) study up to the highest dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day (exposure margin of 16x/7.8x based on total Cmax/AUC24 over the predicted human exposures at a dose of 300 mg/100 mg PF 07321332/ritonavir twice daily). In the rabbit EFD study, there was no PF 07321332-related effect on foetal morphology or embryo-foetal viability up to the highest dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day (exposure margin of 24x/10x based on total Cmax/AUC24), however adverse PF 07321332-related lower foetal body weights (0.91x control) were observed at 1,000 mg/kg/day in the presence of nonadverse, low magnitude effects on maternal body weight change and food consumption at this dose. Growth delay is likely reversible following cessation of exposure in human, and it was not present at the intermediate dose (10x/2.8x Cmax/AUC24 over the predicted clinical exposure). There were no PF-07321332-related severe manifestations of developmental toxicity (malformations and embryo-foetal lethality) at the highest dose tested, 1,000 mg/kg/day.</p>

<h4>Ritonavir</h4>

<p>Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats.</p>

<p>Ritonavir was administered orally to pregnant rats (at 0, 15, 35, and 75 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (at 0, 25, 50, and 110 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis (on GD 6 through 17 and 6 through 19, respectively). No evidence of teratogenicity due to ritonavir was observed in rats and rabbits. Increased incidences of early resorptions, ossification delays and developmental variations, as well as decreased foetal body weights were observed in the rat in the presence of maternal toxicity. A slight increase in the incidence of cryptorchidism was also noted in rats (at a maternally toxic dose). In the rabbit, resorptions, decreased litter size and decreased foetal weights were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. In pre- and post-natal development study in rats, administration 0, 15, 35, and 60 mg/kg/day ritonavir from GD 6 through Post-natal Day 20 resulted in no developmental toxicity.</p>
