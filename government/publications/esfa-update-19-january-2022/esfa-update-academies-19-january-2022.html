<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: 2022 to 2023 academic year general annual grant allocations</h2>

<p>We’ll begin issuing 2022 to 2023 general annual grant allocation statements towards the end of February 2022. We expect to issue all allocation statements to academies that opened before or on 1 January 2022 by the end of March 2022.</p>

<p>Allocations for 2022 to 2023 for February and March 2022 opening academies will be issued by the end of April 2022.</p>

<p>We’ll publish general annual grant allocations guidance in February 2022 before we start to issue the allocation statements.</p>

<p>For those academies with sixth forms, we will issue 16 to 19 allocation calculation toolkits containing funding factors and student numbers in February. We also expect to start issuing 16 to 19 allocations in February, including high needs place numbers, to most school sixth forms, academies and special academies. You can read information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-allocations#allocations-timeline" class="govuk-link">16 to 19 education: funding allocations</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: separate budget forecast return outturn no longer required</h2>

<p>We can confirm that, with immediate effect, we will no longer require academy trusts to submit a separate budget forecast return outturn each year.</p>

<p>We have permanently included the outturn information in the main budget forecast return. We have published the information required on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academies-budget-forecast-return" class="govuk-link">academies budget forecast return</a> GOV.UK page.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: high needs place change request outcomes 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have published the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023" class="govuk-link">high needs place change request outcomes: 2022 to 2023</a> that will inform the funded place numbers for the 2022 to 2023 academic year in academies, free schools, further education colleges and independent learning providers.</p>

<p>You should review the published outcomes as soon as possible, to ensure the numbers reflect those expected. If an institution is not listed, this means no change was notified for that institution and the published 2021 to 2022 place numbers will be used as the basis of the 2022 to 2023 allocation.</p>

<p>Local authorities, academies or further education institutions can contact ESFA to query their 2022 to 2023 place numbers between 19 January 2022 and 4 February 2022.</p>
