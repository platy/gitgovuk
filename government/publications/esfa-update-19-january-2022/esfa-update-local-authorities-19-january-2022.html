<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Information: consultation response on how local authorities improvement functions are funded</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/reforming-how-local-authority-school-improvement-functions-are-funded">government response</a> to our recent consultation on proposals to reform how local authorities’ school improvement functions are funded. This confirms that</p>

<ul>
  <li>we will proceed with reducing the local authority school improvement monitoring and brokering grant by 50% for financial year 2022 to 2023, prior to full removal in financial year 2023-24</li>
  <li>provision will be included in the School and Early Years Finance Regulations 2022 (England) to instead allow local authorities to deduct funding for local authorities’ core school improvement activities from maintained school budgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ESFA are also happy to talk to local authorities on a case-by-case basis if flexibility is required on timings for confirming de-delegation amounts and rates following the Authority Proforma Tool (APT) submission which is due by 21 January.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Information: high needs place change request outcomes 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>We have published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-funding-arrangements-2022-to-2023">high needs place change request outcomes: 2022 to 2023</a> that will inform the funded place numbers for the 2022 to 2023 academic year in academies, free schools, further education colleges and independent learning providers.</p>

<p>You should review the published outcomes as soon as possible, to ensure the numbers reflect those expected. If an institution is not listed, this means no change was notified for that institution and the published 2021 to 2022 place numbers will be used as the basis of the 2022 to 2023 allocation.</p>

<p>Local authorities, academies or further education institutions can contact ESFA to query their 2022 to 2023 place numbers between 19 January 2022 and 4 February 2022.</p>
