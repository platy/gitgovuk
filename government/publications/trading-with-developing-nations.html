<h2>The UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> frameworks</h2>

<h3>Least developed countries framework</h3>

<p>This framework is for countries that the UN classifies as Least Developed Countries. Imports from these countries have quota-free access and nil rates of import duty on all goods other than arms and ammunition.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Afghanistan</li>
  <li>Angola</li>

<h4>Note on Cambodia</h4>
<p>Cambodia currently still receives quota-free access and nil rates of import duty on all goods other than arms and ammunitions under the UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. The UK will continue to raise human rights issues with the Government of Cambodia and continue to monitor the situation</p>

<h3>General Framework</h3>

<p>This framework is for countries that the World Bank classifies as low-income and lower-middle income countries.</p>

<p>Imports from these countries have reduced rates of import duty on certain goods outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#GSP">UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> tariff rates</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Algeria</li>

  <li>Niue</li>
  <li>Syria</li>
  <li>Tajikistan</li>
  <li>Uzbekistan</li>
  <li>Vietnam</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The following countries have signed trade agreements with the UK, however they may still receive GSP market access during the transition to their new trade arrangement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ghana</li>
  <li>Jordan</li>
  <li>Kenya</li>
  <li>Vietnam</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Enhanced Framework</h3>

<p>This framework is for countries that are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>classified by the World Bank as low-income and lower-middle income countries</li>
  <li>economically vulnerable due to a lack of export diversification and a low level of integration with the international trading system</li>
</ul>

<p>They must also implement 27 conventions relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>human and labour rights</li>
  <li>the environment</li>
  <li>good governance</li>
</ul>

<p>Imports from these countries have a nil rate of import duty on certain goods outlined in the <a href="#GSP" class="govuk-link">UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> tariff rates</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#armenia" class="govuk-link">Armenia</a></li>
  <li>Bolivia</li>
  <li>Cape Verde</li>
  <li>Kyrgyzstan</li>
  <li>Mongolia</li>
  <li>Pakistan</li>
  <li>Philippines</li>
  <li>Sri Lanka</li>
</ul>

<p>From 1 November 2021, Uzbekistan is part of the Enhanced Framework. See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-generalised-scheme-of-preferences-admission-of-uzbekistan-to-the-enhanced-framework" class="govuk-link">Uzbekistan admission notice</a>.</p>

<h4>Note on Armenia</h4>
<p>Armenia is now classified as an upper-middle income country by the World Bank. So it will be removed from the UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences on 1 January 2022.</p>

<h2>Rules of origin</h2>

<p>To receive <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rates of import duty, goods must originate from a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-your-goods-meet-the-rules-of-origin" class="govuk-link">Rules of origin</a> are the criteria which establish the country of origin of imported goods.</p>

<p>A list of operations which should be carried out on materials to gain originating status can be found in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1436/schedule/1/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">The Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Importers will have to pay import duty at the full (non-<abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>) rate, if checks carried out by HMRC reveal that the goods do not satisfy the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rules of origin.</p>

<h3>Derogations from the rules of origin</h3>

<p>A derogation can allow more relaxed rules of origin to specific goods originating in specific countries.</p>

<p>A derogation may be granted where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>factors temporarily deprive a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country of the ability to comply with the rules of origin, where they could do so previously</li>
  <li>a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country requires time to prepare itself to comply with the rules of origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>A derogation is time limited, for example; for the length of time needed for the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country to comply with the rule of origin.</p>

<p>A derogation request should be made by the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country, in writing, to the Secretary of State. It should state the reasons why the derogation is requested and should contain supporting documents.</p>

<h3>Cumulation</h3>

<p>Cumulation is when materials originating from specific countries can be incorporated in the products from a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country and then considered as originating in that <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country. This can occur as long as the processing done in the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country goes beyond minimal levels.</p>

<p>The UK cumulation arrangements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bilateral</li>
  <li>regional</li>
  <li>extended</li>
  <li>cumulation with the EU, Norway and Switzerland</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Materials falling within Chapters 1 to 24 of the Harmonized System which originate from Norway or Switzerland are not covered by cumulation.</p>
</div>

<p>The UK will continue to permit materials from the EU, Norway and Switzerland to be further processed or incorporated in a finished product in a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> beneficiary country.</p>

<p>The UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> replicates the effects of the EU non-manipulation rule. Therefore, goods entering the UK via the EU, as a transit country, may still be eligible for <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> preferences under the UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. See <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1436/regulation/20/made" class="govuk-link" rel="external">regulation 20 of The Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Evidence requirements</h3>

<p>Goods that meet the UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rules of origin requirements are eligible to claim a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rate of import duty on the basis of a valid proof of origin. A valid proof of origin must be either of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/940371/Certificate_of_origin_-_FORM_A.pdf">a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> Form A</a> - which does not need to be stamped and signed by an authority designated by the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country: you can submit a copy</li>
  <li>an origin declaration - which must include information to enable the identification of an originating good</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please see further guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-generalised-scheme-of-preferences-form-a">how to complete GSP Form A</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-an-origin-declaration-for-the-uk-generalised-scheme-of-preference" class="govuk-link">how to complete an origin declaration</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>For goods released for free circulation in the UK up to 12 months after 31 December 2020, HMRC will accept a Registered Exporter System (<abbr title="Registered Exporter System">REX</abbr>) statement on origin as proof that goods originate from a <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Registered Exporter System">REX</abbr> statement on origin must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contain, where applicable, the valid <abbr title="Registered Exporter System">REX</abbr> registration number of the exporter</li>
  <li>be dated no later than 31 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The UK does not have an agreement in place with the EU to allow traders to use a replacement proof of origin to redistribute GSP goods between the EU and the UK.</p>
</div>

<p>Goods originating from <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> countries that simply travel through or are stored/split in the EU before being released into free circulation in UK may still be eligible for the UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. These goods must meet the ‘non-manipulation’ rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the goods must be the same goods as were exported from the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country - they must not have been altered or transformed in anyway</li>
  <li>goods must be kept under customs supervision at all times in the country of transit - the goods must not have been released into free circulation in the EU</li>
  <li>the goods must meet the UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> origin rules and will need to be accompanied by a proof of origin made out by the exporter in the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> country in accordance with UK <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> evidence requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Some operations can be conducted in a third country if the goods remain under customs supervision, see <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1436/regulation/20/made">regulation 20 of The Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Suspending <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rates</h2>

<h3>Country graduation</h3>

<p>When a country no longer meets the <a href="#frameworks" class="govuk-link">relevant eligibility requirements</a> it will be removed from the relevant <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> framework. The UK will provide a graduation period of at least 3 years before removing a country from the relevant framework. This is known as country graduation. A country will enter another <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> framework if it meets the relevant requirements.</p>

<h3>Trade arrangement suspension</h3>

<p><abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr> rates may be suspended for countries once they implement a new trade agreement with the UK, which provides them with equivalent or better preferential market access than the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr>. Find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-trade-agreements-with-non-eu-countries#trade-agreements-that-have-been-signed">which countries have agreed a trade agreement with the UK</a>.</p>

<p>Please read further information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-generalised-scheme-of-preferences-trade-arrangement-suspension">countries that have been suspended from receiving preferential rates of import duty under the <abbr title="General Scheme of Preferences">GSP</abbr></a>.</p>

<h3>Goods graduation</h3>

<p>Preferential rates of import duty may be suspended on a specific product group that is already highly competitive without trade preferences. This is known as goods graduation.</p>

<p>The UK’s first list of graduated goods is valid until the end of 2022. The next list of graduated goods will take effect in 2023. It will be reviewed every 3 years and published on this page.</p>
