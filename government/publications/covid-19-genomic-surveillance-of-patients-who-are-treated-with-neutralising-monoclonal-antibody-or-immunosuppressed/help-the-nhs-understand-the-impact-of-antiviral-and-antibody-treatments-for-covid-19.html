<p>The National Health Service is offering new antibody and antiviral treatments for coronavirus (COVID-19). You can find out more information on how to get treatment at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/CoronavirusTreatments" rel="external">Coronavirus treatments</a>.</p>

<h2>Why this is important</h2>

<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 can develop drug resistance, in the same way that other viruses and bacteria can. This is called antimicrobial resistance, and we are monitoring this.</p>

<h2>Who we are looking for</h2>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) is asking people who receive antiviral or monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 to take a polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) test before and after their treatment.</p>

<p>You do not need a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result to get treatment. You do not have to do these tests, but by doing so you can help contribute to our understanding of the virus causing COVID-19, including antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<h2>When to take your tests</h2>

<p>If possible, you should take 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests – one before and one after your treatment. You can take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test any time before your treatment starts.</p>

<p>You should take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test 5 days after you started treatment. Treatment could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>antiviral tablets, for example nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (also known as Paxlovid) or molnupiravir, or an injection, for example remdesivir
or</li>
  <li>an antibody injection (this is called sotrovimab)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to get <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h2>

<p>If you already have a priority <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> at home (the red test kit), you can take this before your treatment. You will then automatically be sent another priority <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to take after your treatment.</p>

<p>If you do not have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test at home and your treatment is being sent to your home, don’t worry, you can still help us. You can order a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> to take on day 5 by calling 119 and explaining that you are receiving COVID-19 treatment and request a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test be sent to your home. Please take the test 5 days after your treatment.</p>

<p>If you receive treatment in a hospital or day-treatment unit, please ask them to provide you with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if they can, for you to use before you start treatment. You will still need to order your second test by calling 119.</p>

<p>Please follow the instructions for registering the test kit either by calling 119 or filling in the details online so that the test can be assigned to you. Further instructions are available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pcr-home-testing-for-people-eligible-for-new-covid-19-treatments"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> home testing for people eligible for COVID-19 treatments</a></p>

<h2>Sending a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h2>
<p>This is entirely voluntary, and it is completely up to you whether you decide to take part.</p>

<h2>Your sample</h2>
<p>Your sample will be tested at a <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> national laboratory. If it is positive for the virus, further genetic analysis of the virus will occur.</p>

<h2>Your result</h2>
<p>The results will be returned to you by text message or email, and it will also be returned to your registered GP. Your test result at day 5 may still be positive. No action is required for these results. However, if you remain unwell or your condition deteriorates, please call your GP or 119.</p>

<h2>If you have a positive lateral flow test (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>), you still need to carry out a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h2>
<p>We are unable to carry out the genetic analysis on the virus from a <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>. However, a <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result is sufficient for you to access treatment.</p>

<h2>If your replacement <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> hasn’t arrived 5 days after treatment</h2>
<p>If your kit has not arrived by day 7, a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test can be requested by calling 119. On the call, please identify yourself as an individual eligible for COVID-19 treatment and request a priority <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> kit for surveillance. We would like you to return your test even if it is received late as this will help us understand how well people clear the virus at later time points, and, if the test is positive, we may still be able to perform genetic analysis on the virus.</p>

<h2>How your data will be stored, processed, shared and who will have access to it</h2>
<p>We will keep your data confidential in our secure storage facilities as we would with all your medical data. Before analysis your data will be anonymised and kept confidential in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations. Further information is available within the surveillance protocol. Non-identifiable information may be collected, analysed, reported and shared with others within Europe to contribute to research. Non-identifiable data will be used in reports and scientific publications and may be made available to companies to support surveillance activities in collaboration with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Taking an extra <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</h2>
<p>These tests are entirely voluntary and if you have any concerns about whether you should be taking an extra test, for example if you find it uncomfortable, are on blood-thinning medication (anticoagulation) or suffering from nosebleeds, then you are under no obligation to participate. However, your participation will help us understand how the virus may change and mutate with treatment. This will be extremely important for us over the next year as we continue to treat individuals like yourself who need this treatment.</p>

<h2>Review of the study</h2>
<p>An independent group at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> called the Research Ethics and Governance Group has reviewed and approved this surveillance study.</p>
