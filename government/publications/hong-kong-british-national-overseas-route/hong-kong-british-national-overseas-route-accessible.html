<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This section sets out the context for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status.</p>

<p>BN(O) status is a form of British nationality created for people from Hong Kong so they could retain a form of British nationality and a connection to the UK after the handover to China in 1997 in line with the Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p>

<p>Anyone who was a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality">British Dependent Territories citizen</a> through a connection with Hong Kong was able to apply to register as a BN(O) status holder and apply for a BN(O) passport. People could apply for BN(O) status for a period of 10 years prior to the handover to China on 1 July 1997. Some children aged under 18 were also listed as BN(O) status holders in their parentsâ BN(O) passports at the time of the handover. BN(O) status is valid for life and cannot be passed on to spouses or children. It is not possible to apply for BN(O) status now.</p>

<p>The UK government has introduced an immigration route for BN(O) status holders, providing the opportunity for them and certain family members who form part of their household to live, work, and study in the UK. This follows the imposition by the Chinese Government of a national security law on Hong Kong, in breach of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, which restricts the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Under these arrangements, eligible BN(O) status holders and certain family members were initially able to come to the UK via a concession to grant them âleave outside the rules at the borderâ. The concession ended on 19 July 2021. The grant of permission gave entitlements to work and study, but no recourse to public funds.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants for the Hong Kong BN(O) route already in the UK on another route, for example the Skilled Worker route, can apply to switch from within the UK.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong BN(O) route provides for permission to stay and to obtain settlement in the UK, as well as entry clearance from overseas.</p>

<h2>Overview of the Hong Kong BN(O) route</h2>

<p>This section introduces the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route and gives an overview of the qualifying requirements.</p>

<h3>What is the Hong Kong BN(O) route?</h3>

<p>The Hong Kong BN(O) route allows BN(O) status holders and certain family members to live, work and study in the UK. After 5 years, applicants will be able to apply for settlement, and after a further year, British citizenship, providing they meet the requirements.</p>

<p>There are 2 pathways under the Hong Kong BN(O) route in the rules: the BN(O) Status Holder Route and the BN(O) Household Member route.</p>

<p>Applicants will be able to apply for permission for either 5 years or 30 months. Those granted entry clearance or permission to stay will be able to work in almost any capacity and study in the UK. They will not be able to access public funds.</p>

<p>In alignment with the UK, the Crown Dependencies (CDs) have also introduced a Hong Kong BN(O) route. Applicants to the BN(O) route operated by the CDs are subject to the same conditions and fees as those applying to the UKâs Hong Kong BN(O) route. However, the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is not payable for Crown Dependency BN(O) routes. The CDs make their own immigration rules as they are self-governing jurisdictions, but they have adopted the UKâs BN(O) rules.</p>

<p>Applications for the Hong Kong BN(O) route can be made online on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa">GOV.UK</a> and via the UK Immigration: ID Check app.</p>

<h3>Where to find the rules</h3>

<p>The route-specific Immigration Rules are contained in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas)</a>. These apply to all applications for entry clearance, permission to stay and settlement.</p>

<h3>Structure of Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas)</h3>

<p>Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas) is divided into 3 main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>BN(O) Status Holder route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BN(O) Household Member route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Settlement on the Hong Kong BN(O) route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each part is further subdivided into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>validity requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>suitability requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eligibility requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decision (including period and conditions of stay)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The BN(O) Status Holder route is for BN(O) status holders, their partner or spouse, their dependent children or grandchildren under the age of 18, and an adult relative with a high degree of dependency on the BN(O) or the BN(O)âs partner.</p>

<p>Uniquely, the BN(O) Household Member route allows an adult child of a BN(O) status holder or of the partner of a BN(O) status holder born after the handover on 1 July 1997 to apply on the Hong Kong BN(O) route as a dependant of a BN(O) status holder or their partner where they form part of the same household. The BN(O) Household Memberâs partner or spouse and dependent children can also apply with the BN(O) Household Member on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>The BN(O) Status Holder and BN(O) Household Member routes ensure that family households can move to the UK together, provided that family members are part of the same household as the BN(O) status holder.</p>

<h2>Considering evidence</h2>

<p>This section provides general guidance on considering evidence submitted by an applicant on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route, including when it may be appropriate to request further information, and verification or translation of documents.</p>

<h3>Supporting documents and information</h3>

<p>All applicants are required to submit relevant information and supporting documents (including but not limited to evidence of their BN(O) status, finances, and a valid TB test certificate) to show they meet the requirements of the route. The application form provides guidance to applicants on what evidence to submit.</p>

<h3>Burden and standard of proof</h3>

<p>The burden of proof is on the applicant to show they meet the validity and eligibility requirements of the rules. In some circumstances the burden may shift to the Home Office to show the applicant does not meet the suitability rules. See the relevant guidance on suitability for further information.</p>

<p>You must review the information on the application form and supporting evidence before deciding whether you are satisfied on the balance of probabilities (in other words that it is more likely than not) that the applicant has met the requirements of the rules.</p>

<h3>Requesting more information</h3>

<p>If you need more information, or clarification of certain details, to decide whether an application is valid, or if it meets the suitability and eligibility requirements, you should consider requesting more information. You should apply the guidance on validity and evidential flexibility and consult the sections on <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark19">validity</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark46">evidential</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark46">flexibility</a> below.</p>

<h3>Verifying documents</h3>

<p>You must conduct verification checks if you have any doubts about whether any supporting document an applicant has submitted is genuine.</p>

<h3>Documents not in English or Welsh</h3>

<p>All documents submitted with an application should be in English or Welsh. If the applicant submits documents in another language and you are unable to understand or interpret the evidence, you must ask them to submit a certified translation if they have not already provided one with their application. The translation must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that it is an accurate translation of the original document</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be dated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include the full name and signature of the translator or an authorised official of the translation company</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include the translator or translation companyâs contact details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the applicant is applying for permission to stay or settlement, be certified by a qualified translator and include details of the translator or translation companyâs credentials</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the translation does not meet these requirements and you are unable to understand or interpret the document, you may disregard it as evidence. This may result in the application being refused. For example, if you are unable to understand or interpret the applicantâs evidence of their relationship to the BN(O) status holder (and they have not provided a suitable translation), and there is no other relevant evidence, you must refuse the application on the basis that you are not satisfied that they are the dependant of a BN(O) status holder. For further information, see guidance on Example refusal wording for applications on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<h4>Translation of Welsh documents</h4>

<p>Birth, marriage, civil partnership and death certificates issued in Wales are issued either in English only or bilingually (that is, with both Welsh and English printed on the same document). Such documents will therefore not require translation.</p>

<p>If you receive any supporting documentation in Welsh only (for example, an employerâs covering letter), and you and your colleagues are unable to understand Welsh, you must arrange for the document to be translated into English.</p>

<p>Under the Home Office Welsh language scheme, customers living in Wales are entitled to correspond with the Home Office in Welsh. If an applicant writes to you in Welsh, they must receive a reply in Welsh.</p>

<p>The Home Office has a framework agreement with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en-gb.thebigword.com/" rel="external">the Big Word</a> translation company to translate material to and from Welsh. The cost of any translation must be met by your unit or directorate.</p>

<p>For guidance on handling correspondence in Welsh and how to procure Welsh translation services, see: Staff guide to the Home Office Welsh language scheme.</p>

<h2>Validity requirements</h2>

<p>This section tells you what validity requirements an applicant must meet for a grant of entry clearance, permission to stay in the UK or settlement on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route. Route specific validation requirements are currently only applied in country, they will be rolled out to applications made out of country when the technology is in place.</p>

<p>For further information, see the guidance on Applications for leave to remain: validation, variation and withdrawal.</p>

<h3>Entry clearance or permission to stay</h3>

<p>Before you consider an application for entry clearance or permission to stay, you must check whether the application is valid. The validity requirements for the Hong Kong BN(O) route are set out in the following paragraphs of the Immigration Rules:</p>

<h4>Requirement: biometrics</h4>

<p>Under the Immigration (Provision of Physical Data) Regulations 2006 (as amended), all applicants are required to provide a passport-style facial photograph of themselves as part of the application process.</p>

<p>BN(O), HKSAR, or EEA passport holders applying from overseas or in the UK will not have to provide fingerprints if they successfully apply on the UK Immigration: ID Check app. However, if an applicant is not able to use this application route (for example because they do not hold a biometric chipped passport or chip checker fails), they must provide fingerprint biometrics at a registered <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-visa-application-centre">visa application centre</a> (VAC) overseas or at a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvcas">UKVCAS service point</a> in the UK.</p>

<p>All other passport holders will be required to present their passport and give their fingerprint biometrics at a registered visa application centre overseas or at a UKVCAS service point in the UK as part of the application process.</p>

<p>See the published biometric guidance for more details.</p>

<h4>Requirement: proof of identity</h4>

<p>The application form includes guidance for applicants on what they can submit as proof of identity to meet the requirements set out in Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas).</p>

<p>An applicant must provide a passport or other travel document which satisfactorily establishes their identity and nationality.</p>

<h4>Requirement: age</h4>

<p>A BN(O) status holder must be aged 18 or over on the date of application.</p>

<p>A BN(O) Household Child must be under the age of 18 at the date of application.</p>

<p>A BN(O) Household Member must have been born on or after 1 July 1997 and must be aged 18 or over on the date of application.</p>

<h3>Settlement</h3>

<p>Before you consider an application for settlement, you must check whether the application is valid. The validity requirements are set out in paragraphs HK 55.1 to HK 55.3 of the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>These requirements include that the applicantâs last grant of permission must have been on the Hong Kong BN(O) route and they must be in the UK when applying for settlement.</p>

<h2>Suitability requirements</h2>

<p>This section tells you where to find the suitability requirements an applicant must meet when they apply for entry clearance, permission to stay, or settlement on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route.</p>

<p>You must check the application meets the suitability requirements by referring to the suitability requirements set out at the following paragraphs of Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas):</p>

<p>To meet the suitability requirements above, you must check that the applicant does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds for refusal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9 of the Immigration Rules</a>.</p>

<p>If the applicant is applying for permission to stay or settlement, you must check that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is not in breach of immigration laws, except periods of overstaying discounted under paragraph 39E - refer to the full guidance on overstaying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is not on immigration bail</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For guidance on assessing this requirement, see Grounds for refusal and cancellation (suitability). You should consult the relevant part of the guidance according to the circumstances of the applicant.</p>

<h3>Overseas convictions and offences not recognised in the UK</h3>

<p>Some overseas convictions do not have a direct equivalent in the UK and would not be recognised. For example, some convictions may be for offences which are not crimes in the UK. Furthermore, some overseas offences may carry a much higher penalty than an equivalent offence would in the UK. Such convictions would not count as automatic grounds for refusal on this route. See the criminality policy guidance: âOverseas convictions and offences not recognised in the UKâ for more information. You must consult your senior caseworker and the BN(O) Route Policy team if this consideration applies.</p>

<p>See the sections <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark66">Grant or refuse entry clearance</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">Grant or refuse permission to</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">stay</a> for more information about refusing an application.</p>

<h3>Applicant refused on suitability grounds</h3>

<p>If you are not satisfied the applicant meets the suitability requirements, you must refuse the application. You should still fully consider whether the applicant meets the eligibility requirements for entry clearance, permission to stay, or settlement, as appropriate. If the applicant also fails under any of the eligibility criteria, you must also include these in the refusal notice.</p>

<h2>Eligibility for entry clearance or permission to stay</h2>

<p>This section tells you the eligibility requirements for entry clearance or permission to stay for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) main applicants and certain family members.</p>

<h3>BN(O) status holder requirement</h3>

<p>The main applicant must be a BN(O) status holder.</p>

<p>The definition of a BN(O) status holder can be found in the Passports of UK and British Overseas Citizens guidance and the British Overseas Citizens guidance. Evidence of BN(O) status may include a valid or expired BN(O) passport or confirmation of registration as a BN(O) status holder using Home Office records such as the relevant Her Majestyâs Passport Office (HMPO) database.</p>

<p>An applicant may hold both BN(O) status and British citizenship. British citizens have the right of abode in the UK. If a BN(O) status holder who is also a British citizen makes an application, you should void their application.</p>

<h4>BN(O) status holders who were registered as children</h4>

<p>Some applicants who were under 18 on 1 July 1997 may have been added onto their parentâs passport. You should therefore check their parentâs details on the relevant HMPO database. Furthermore, some BN(O) status holders were born between 1 January 1997 and 30 June 1997. Their parents were given until 30 September 1997, after the handover, to register them as BN(O) status holders.</p>

<h4>Lack of evidence of BN(O) status</h4>

<p>If the applicant claims to be eligible for BN(O) status but cannot produce evidence of their eligibility, for example their BN(O) passport or their parentâs BN(O) passport is lost or has been stolen, you should check the relevant HMPO database. If you have no grounds to believe there is fraud or abuse, confirmation with HMPO will be sufficient for meeting this requirement. If the passport has been stolen and there are concerns around the applicantâs identity, you may consult Intel and/or refuse the application.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Official - sensitive: end of section</p>
</div>

<h4>If a BN(O) is deceased or dies during the application process</h4>

<p>Family members of a BN(O) status holder who died before an application was made under the Hong Kong BN(O) route will not be eligible to apply as if they were dependants of the deceased BN(O) status holder, unless they are a BN(O) status holder in their own right or the family member of another BN(O) status holder.</p>

<p>This does not apply if the BN(O) status holder dies during the application process, under a concession outside Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas). If the main applicant has submitted an application for permission under the BN(O) route that would not have been refused and their identity can be verified, regardless of whether they have submitted a valid application, you should consider the applications of their family members. You should assess whether they meet the eligibility and suitability requirements of the route as if the main BN(O) applicant were still alive. You must consider the care requirement for dependent children and Adult Dependent Relatives as set out below. If they do meet all remaining requirements, you can grant them permission on the BN(O) route. You may request further evidence if necessary, for instance, if the maintenance funds are held exclusively by the deceased main applicant at the time of applying, in line with the guidance on evidential flexibility.</p>

<p>The identity of the main applicant must still be verified. If the BN(O) main applicant has enrolled biometrics at a Visa Application Centre or UKVCAS service point or has scanned their passport on the UK Immigration: ID Check App, you will be able to confirm their identity and therefore, the eligibility of the applicant and their family members for the route. If the BN(O) status holder has not yet enrolled their biometrics, you should write out to the family of the deceased applicant to ask them to submit the BN(O) status holderâs passport in order to verify their identity.</p>

<p>You will also need to appoint one of the remaining family members as the main applicant for the purpose of granting permission for the dependants. In most cases, this will be another adult who is responsible for the care of the remaining applicants, for example the dependent partner of the BN(O) status holder.</p>

<p>The care requirement also still applies to dependent children under 18 and Adult Dependent Relatives (ADRs). In order to meet the care requirements for the route and maintain a necessary level of safeguarding, if the deceased BN(O) applicant was the sole care provider for dependants who are either children under 18 or an ADR, you should refuse their applications on the grounds that the applicant or applicants do not meet the care requirement in the rules. If there is, however, another adult who is responsible for the care of the children or the vulnerable adult (for instance, a spouse or partner, or the other parent of the children) who is also making an application, or already has permission on the route, you should consider the care requirement met as long as you are satisfied that the individual is responsible for the dependantsâ care.</p>

<p>Additionally, if a BN(O) main applicant passes away during the application process, and their partner and/or children under 18 subsequently make an application under the BN(O) route, their applications may be considered as if the main BN(O) applicant were still alive. See the section on âapplying together: Who can apply separately from the main applicant?â below for more information.</p>

<p>If a dependent child under 18 or Adult Dependent Relative makes a subsequent application for permission to stay, but their main applicant has passed away since the initial grant, you should still consider whether their application meets the requirements of the rules. You may consult your senior caseworker, who may refer to the BN(O) Route Policy team, for further advice.</p>

<h3>Financial requirement</h3>

<p>This section tells you about the financial requirement for the Hong Kong BN(O) route for entry clearance and permission to stay. For further information please refer to the Financial requirement guidance.</p>

<p>There is no set level of funds an applicant must hold. However, all applicants, including their dependants, must be able to prove they can adequately maintain and accommodate themselves in the UK for 6 months without access to public funds.</p>

<p>Evidence of finances must be shown as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-finance">Appendix Finance</a> to the Immigration Rules. The most recently dated piece of evidence should be dated within 31 days of the date of application.</p>

<p>Applicants can rely on credible offers of financial support and/or accommodation from a third party (for example, a relative or friend) to meet this requirement. The test for adequate maintenance is whether you can show that, after your accommodation costs have been paid, you have at least as much money as you would if your family were receiving income support in the UK.</p>

<p>For further guidance on assessing adequate maintenance, see the Financial requirement guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants will not have to meet the financial requirement if they have already been living in the UK for 12 months when they apply for permission to stay on the Hong Kong BN(O) route with the exception of those who have been granted 12 monthsâ leave outside the rules where their BN(O) application has been refused previously and those switching from the Youth Mobility Scheme. See âApplicants who have lived in the UK for 12 months with permissionâ in the Financial requirement guidance for further information on how to assess this.</p>

<h4>Entry clearance applications</h4>

<p>If you are not satisfied that the applicant and their dependants can meet the financial requirement, you must refuse the application for entry clearance.</p>

<h4>Permission to stay applications</h4>

<p>If the applicant and their dependants are applying for permission to stay in the UK, but their applications fall for refusal because you are not satisfied they can meet the financial requirement, you can exercise discretion to grant 12 monthsâ leave outside the rules. See the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">âExceptions: leave outside the rules following a</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">refusalâ</a> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">âGrant or refuse permission to stayâ</a> section for further information.</p>

<h3>Ordinary residence requirement</h3>

<p>This section sets out what documentary evidence an applicant must provide to prove their ordinary residence.</p>

<p>Ordinary residence has the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is a regular, habitual mode of life in a particular place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>its continuity has persisted despite temporary absences</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it may be of long or short duration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it must be lawful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it must have been adopted voluntarily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it must be for a settled purpose</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The sections below provide non-exhaustive lists of the type of documentary evidence which the applicant will be able to provide. The guidance below is not prescriptive or definitive. Some applicants may lack documentary evidence in their own name for various reasons, you must work flexibly with applicants to help them evidence their ordinary residence by the best means available to them.</p>

<p>Periods of absence do not necessarily mean that a personâs ordinary residence has ceased. Applicants for the Hong Kong BN(O) route can apply for entry clearance from any country outside the UK but must be able to demonstrate their ordinary residence in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>For example, students studying abroad, businesspeople working away from Hong Kong or applicants visiting family overseas when they apply for the Hong Kong BN(O) route would usually meet the requirement for ordinary residence in Hong Kong. However, an applicant for the Hong Kong BN(O) route with a permanent or settled immigration status in another country would likely not meet the ordinary residence requirement for entry clearance.</p>

<p>For further information, see âAbsences during a period of residenceâ in the guidance on Nationality policy: assessing ordinary residence.</p>

<h4>Entry clearance applications</h4>

<p>Applicants who have submitted an application for entry clearance must be outside the UK and must show they are ordinarily resident in Hong Kong at the date of application.</p>

<p>Evidence of ordinary residence in Hong Kong could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an official Hong Kong ID card</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an official Hong Kong permanent ID card</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a letter from an employer confirming their employment in Hong Kong</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a visa or residence permit or other immigration documents (a colour photocopy would be acceptable) showing residence in Hong Kong</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an educational record, for example a school report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tax records</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>records of rent or mortgage payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>payslips</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>household or utility bills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>valid tuberculosis certificate (see: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark42">Tuberculosis (TB) certificate requirement</a>) passport stamps that show an applicant travelling from, and returning to, Hong Kong for travel overseas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tuberculosis certificates and passport stamps can only be accepted as evidence of ordinary residence in Hong Kong in conjunction with other forms of evidence.</p>

<h4>Permission to stay applications</h4>

<p>Applicants for permission to stay must be in the UK and must show they are ordinarily resident in the UK, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Isle of Man or Hong Kong at the date of application.</p>

<p>If the applicant is applying for permission to stay, for example they were granted leave outside the rules at the border or they have a previous grant of permission, you should check whether there is an existing immigration footprint for them to evidence their ordinary residence (for example, a passport stamp confirming entry at the UK border). If they do have an existing immigration footprint then further evidence of this is not required.</p>

<p>If there is no existing immigration footprint, evidence of ordinary residence in the UK, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, Bailiwick of Jersey, or the Isle of Man could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a letter from an employer or education provider confirming their employment or study</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a dated bank statement showing payments received or spending</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a dated letter from a GP or other healthcare professional confirming the applicantâs attendance at appointments, or a card issued by the healthcare professional confirming those appointments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a payslip or most recent P60</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a dated, UK or Islands-addressed domestic utility bill or council tax bill</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a letter from the local council or a government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a voterâs card</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an educational record, for example a school report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other immigration documents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>records of rent or mortgage payments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tax records</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the applicant and their dependants are applying for permission to stay in the UK but their applications fall for refusal because you are not satisfied they can meet the ordinary residence requirement, you have the discretion to grant 12 monthsâ leave outside the rules. See the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">âExceptions: leave outside the rules following</a></p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">a refusalâ</a> in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark73">âGrant or refuse permission to stayâ</a> section for further information.</p>

<p>In most cases this will be a simple assessment. In more complex cases, the principles of establishing whether someone is ordinarily resident in the UK may be applied here. See: Nationality Policy - assessing ordinary residence.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis (TB) certificate requirement</h3>

<p>Applicants and their dependants are required to provide a valid TB certificate for entry clearance or permission to stay applications, unless a qualifying exemption applies.</p>

<h4>Entry clearance applications</h4>

<p>Where an applicant is applying for entry clearance, they will need to provide a valid TB certificate with their application if they have been residing within a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T</a> of the immigration rules for the 6 months immediately preceding the application.</p>

<p>The requirement is met if the applicant provided a valid TB certificate as part of a successful application for entry clearance in the 12 months prior to the date of application for the Hong Kong BN(O) route, for example they were granted entry clearance on a family visa or family permit.</p>

<p>If an applicant on the BN(O) route has not supplied a valid TB certificate when they are required to do so, you should make one attempt to contact the applicant and give them 10 working days to provide the certificate. If the applicant fails to provide a valid TB certificate following this, the application should be refused. If an applicantâs certificate shows that they have tested positive for TB, their application should also be refused.</p>

<p>For further information regarding which applicants are required to obtain a TB certificate before applying and the approved test centres, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">Tuberculosis tests for visa applicants</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Permission to stay applications</h4>

<p>For in-country applications, if the applicant has last been granted permission to stay in the UK for 6 months or less at the date of application, they must provide a valid test certificate obtained either from an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-tuberculosis-test-clinics-for-hong-kong-bno/tuberculosis-testing-in-the-uk">approved clinic in the UK</a> or an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk">approved clinic</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa/countries-where-you-need-a-tb-test-to-enter-the-uk">outside the UK</a> if they were previously in a country listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-t-tuberculosis-screening">Appendix T</a> of the rules.</p>

<p>The requirement is met if the applicant provided a valid TB certificate as part of a successful application for entry clearance in the 12 months prior to the date of application for the Hong Kong BN(O) route, for example they were granted entry clearance on a family visa or family permit.</p>

<p>For permission to stay applications, where applicants have tested positive for TB and can demonstrate that they are getting treatment (for example a letter from a GP), their application should not be refused but should be kept on hold, allowing the applicant to stay with 3C leave for a minimum of six months while they undertake a full course of treatment. If the applicant provides a positive test certificate and then a negative test certificate shortly afterwards, this should not be taken as proof that the applicant no longer has TB. The applicant must complete a full course of treatment (minimum 6 months) and have written evidence of successful treatment before being reassessed for TB infection.</p>

<p>For further information regarding which applicants are required to obtain a TB certificate before applying and the approved test centres, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/tb-test-visa">Tuberculosis tests for visa applicants</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>Children</h4>

<p>All children must see a clinician at an approved clinic who will decide if they need a chest x-ray. If the clinician decides the child does not have TB, they will provide a certificate which should be included in their application.</p>

<h3>Evidential flexibility</h3>

<p>Consult the guidance on evidential flexibility further information on how to assess cases where evidence is missing.</p>

<h2>Eligible dependants</h2>

<p>As set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">overview of the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O))</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark8">route section</a>, a person who is a BN(O) may apply under the Hong Kong BN(O) route. The route also allows dependants of that main applicant (their partner, or children or grandchildren under the age of 18) and, in some cases, other members of their household to apply to come to the UK or remain in the UK with the main applicant. Family members can be of any nationality and hold any passport.</p>

<p>On their first application under the route, all family members must be able to demonstrate that they meet a relationship requirement which links them to a BN(O) status holder, and, if they are applying as a BN(O) Household Member, the family member of a BN(O) Household Member, the grandchild of a BN(O) status holder, or BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative, that they form part of the same household as that BN(O) status holder. In subsequent applications, following a successful grant of permission, it will be sufficient for the partner, adult child or partner of the adult child to show that they already hold permission on the route.</p>

<p>However, a child or grandchild who is under the age of 18 or an Adult Dependent Relative must continue to demonstrate that they meet a relationship requirement which links them to a person who has permission under the route. This is to ensure that those who have an on-going need to be cared for or supported by a relevant family member cannot have their application disconnected from that family member.</p>

<p>A child who is under the age of 18 on their first application, but following a successful grant of permission is aged 18 or over on their subsequent application, should apply as a BN(O) Household Member in that subsequent application and, as with other adult children, will not need to demonstrate that they continue to meet a relationship requirement.</p>

<p>Dependants making an initial application for permission should be granted in line with the main applicant. If the main applicant and their dependants apply for different lengths of permission (e.g. the main applicant applies for 5 years and their dependants apply for 30 months), you should write to the applicants to notify them that they must all apply for the same length of permission, either 30 months or 5 years.</p>

<p>Any dependants must meet the eligibility and suitability requirements of this route.</p>

<h3>Applying together</h3>

<p>Our expectation is that BN(O) status holders and relevant family members will usually apply for the Hong Kong BN(O) route together, although they may choose to travel to the UK separately. See: <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark52">Travelling to the UK separately</a>. In practice, this means that the main applicant who is a BN(O) status holder should apply first and receive their Unique Applicant Number (UAN) or Global Web Form (GWF) reference. Any dependants applying will need to quote this UAN or GWF in their applications.</p>

<p>BN(O) Household Members, the partner and child of a BN(O) Household Member, the grandchild of a BN(O) status holder, and Adult Dependent Relatives should apply within 48 hours of the main applicant.</p>

<h4>Who must apply together with the main applicant?</h4>

<p>A BN(O) Household Member, and their family members, a grandchild of a BN(O) status holder, or a BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative must apply for permission at the same time as the main applicant. Therefore, if a BN(O) status holder is granted entry clearance or permission to stay and a BN(O) Household Member, grandchild, or BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative makes an application at a later date, you must refuse the application.</p>

<h4>Who can apply separately from the main applicant?</h4>

<p>Dependent partners and dependent children aged under 18 are not required to apply at the same time as the main applicant and can instead apply to join the main applicant at a later date. When applying as a dependent partner or child for the first time, the main applicant must have either made a valid application for entry clearance or permission to stay that has not been decided; or have entry clearance or permission as a BN(O) status holder or as the partner of a BN(O) status holder. If a dependent partner and/or dependent children are applying to join a main applicant who has already been granted permission to stay within the UK, all dependants should be granted permission in line with the end date of the main applicantâs permission.</p>

<p>The partner and dependent child of a BN(O) status holder who passed away during the application process are also not required to have applied at the same time as the main applicant.</p>

<h4>Children born in the UK</h4>

<p>The parents of a child born in the UK, who have permission on the BN(O) route, should register the birth and apply for permission for the child. You should grant these children permission on the route in line with that of the BN(O) Status Holder or BN(O) Household Member (as applicable). When considering the application of such a child, you should also confirm whether one of the childâs parents is a British citizen and therefore whether the child themselves is a British citizen and so is not eligible for permission on the BN(O) route.</p>

<h4>Travelling to the UK separately</h4>

<p>Once they have been granted permission, applicants may choose to travel to the UK separately. Applicants must travel to the UK within 90 days if they went to a visa application centre to prove their identity, or before their permission (either 30 months or 5 years) expires if they used the âUK Immigration: ID Checkâ smartphone app to prove their identity. Children under 18 must travel with one or both parents, unless they are joining their parents who are already in the UK.</p>

<p>Additionally, for a grant of settlement on the Hong Kong BN(O) route, a BN(O) Household Child must be being granted at the same time as their BN(O) status holder parent, and/or their other parent who is already settled or a British citizen. A BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative must also be applying for settlement at the same time as the BN(O) status holder or the partner of a BN(O) status holder, or who is already settled or a British citizen. If the BN(O) status holder and their dependent BN(O) household child or BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative travelled to the UK separately, the continuous residence requirement for settlement may mean that these dependants may have to apply for further permission to stay beyond 5 years if the BN(O) status holder has not yet fulfilled the continuous residence requirement.</p>

<h3>Dependent partner</h3>

<p>The dependent partner must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for entry clearance (HK 34.2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for permission to stay in the UK (see HK 42.1 to 42.4)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the maintenance requirements (HK 40.1 to 40.5)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, or the Isle of Man (HK 41.1 to 41.2)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessing the relationship</h4>

<p>The dependent partner must meet the relationship requirement. If they are applying for permission to stay and have permission as a dependent partner on the BN(O) Status Holder route on the date of application, they will meet the relationship requirement. Otherwise they must demonstrate they meet the following.</p>

<p>The relationship must be genuine and subsisting. The partner should normally live with the BN(O) status holder and intend to live with the BN(O) status holder once in the UK.</p>

<p>A BN(O) status holderâs spouse or civil partner should enclose a digital copy of their marriage or civil partnership certificate along with their application.</p>

<p>If the partner is not the spouse or civil partner of the BN(O), they must show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they have been living together in a relationship similar to marriage or civil partnership for 2 years before applying</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any previous relationships of the BN(O) status holder or the partner must be permanently broken down</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they can marry in the UK, such as they are not prohibited by law to marry due to being closely related</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See the Relationship section of the Family life (as a partner or parent), private life and exceptional circumstances guidance for further information.</p>

<h3>BN(O) Household Child</h3>

<p>A BN(O) Household Child is the dependent child or grandchild under the age of 18 of a BN(O) status holder or their partner.</p>

<p>Both of the BN(O) Household Childâs parents must apply together with the Household Child, or have permission to be in the UK (except as a visitor). The requirement to have permission does not apply if the parent is a British citizen, or a person who has a right to enter or stay in the UK without restriction (although such persons are required to be ordinarily resident in the UK, or to become so). The following exemptions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the parent who is a BN(O) status holder or the partner of a BN(O) status holder is the only living parent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parent who is a BN(O) status holder or the partner of a BN(O) status holder has sole responsibility for bringing up the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the parent who has permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the BN(O) grandparent or BN(O) grandparentâs partner who has permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The household child must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>normally live with the BN(O) status holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live with a parent who has permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route during their stay in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for entry clearance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying in country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the maintenance requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, or the Isle of Man</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a dependent child is born in the UK to a BN(O) status holder and/or their partner, who already have permission on the route, the BN(O) status holder and/or their partner should apply for permission for the child and provide a full UK birth certificate showing the names of the childâs parents.</p>

<h4>Assessing the relationship</h4>

<p>The main applicant must show evidence that they are the parent, adopted parent or guardian of the household child, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full birth certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an adoption certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a court order, such as a special guardianship order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The best interests of a child</h3>

<p>The duty in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" rel="external">section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009</a> to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of a child under the age of 18 in the UK, together with Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, means that consideration of the childâs best interests must be a primary consideration in immigration decisions affecting them. This guidance and the Immigration Rules it covers form part of the arrangements for ensuring that we give practical effect to these obligations.</p>

<p>Where a child or children in the UK will be affected by the decision, you must have regard to their best interests in making the decision. You must carefully consider all the information and evidence provided concerning the best interests of a child in the UK and the impact the decision may have on the child.</p>

<p>Although the duty in section 55 only applies to children in the UK, the statutory guidance â <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/every-child-matters-statutory-guidance">Every Child Matters â Change for Children</a> â provides guidance on the extent to which the spirit of the duty should be applied to children overseas. You must adhere to the spirit of the duty and make enquiries when you have reason to suspect that a child may be in need of protection or safeguarding, or presents welfare needs that require attention. In some instances, international or local agreements are in place that permit or require children to be referred to the authorities of other countries and you are to abide by these and work with local agencies in order to develop arrangements that protect children and reduce the risk of trafficking and exploitation.</p>

<p>Further guidance can be found in paragraphs 2.34 to 2.36 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/every-child-matters-statutory-guidance">statutory guidance</a>.</p>

<h3>BN(O) Household Member</h3>

<p>A BN(O) Household Member is the child of a BN(O) status holder, or the partner of a BN(O) status holder, who was born on or after 1 July 1997. The BN(O) Household Member route may also be used where a person had permission as a BN(O) Household child but no longer qualifies for that route because they are aged 18 or over. The applicant cannot have or have last had permission as a BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative on the BN(O) Status Holder route.</p>

<p>The Household Member must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>normally live with the BN(O) status holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be the child of someone who is being granted permission as a BN(O) status holder or the partner of a BN(O) status holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for entry clearance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying in country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the maintenance requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, or the Isle of Man</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessing the relationship</h4>

<p>Where the BN(O) Household Member applicant does not have permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route, the BN(O) main applicant must show evidence that they are the parent, adoptive parent or guardian of the applicant, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full birth certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an adoption certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a court order, such as a special guardianship order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Dependent partner of a BN(O) Household Member</h3>

<p>The dependent partner of a BN(O) Household Member must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>normally live with the BN(O) Household Member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for entry clearance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying in country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the maintenance requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, or the Isle of Man</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Assessing the relationship</h4>

<p>The dependent partner must meet the relationship requirement. If they are applying for permission to stay and have permission as a dependent partner on the BN(O) Household Member route on the date of application, they will meet the relationship requirement. Otherwise they must demonstrate they meet the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the relationship between the Household Member and the Household Member partner must be genuine and subsisting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Household Member partner should normally live with the BN(O) Household Member and intend to live with the BN(O) Household Member once in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the partner and BN(O) Household Member should apply together, along with the main applicant who is a BN(O) status holder</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A BN(O) Household Memberâs spouse or civil partner should enclose a scan of their marriage or civil partnership certificate along with their application.</p>

<p>If the partner is not the spouse or civil partner of the BN(O) Household Member, they must show that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they have been living together in a relationship similar to marriage or civil partnership for 2 years before applying</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any previous relationships of the BN(O) Household Member or the Household Memberâs partner must be permanently broken down</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they can marry in the UK, such as they are not prohibited by law to marry due to being closely related</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>See the Relationship section of the Family life (as a partner or parent), private life and exceptional circumstances guidance for further information.</p>

<h3>Dependent child of a BN(O) Household Member</h3>

<p>The Household Memberâs Child must be the child of an applicant granted permission as a BN(O) Household Member or their partner.</p>

<p>Both of the parents of a dependent child of a BN(O) Household Member must apply together with the dependent child, or have permission to be in the UK (except as a visitor). The requirement to have permission does not apply if the parent is a British citizen and exempt from immigration control, or a person who has a right to enter or stay in the UK without restriction (although such persons are required to be ordinarily resident in the UK, or to become so). The following exemptions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the parent who is a BN(O) Household Member or the partner of a BN(O) Household Member is the only living parent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the parent who is a BN(O) Household Member or the partner of a BN(O) Household Member has sole responsibility for bringing up the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child entry clearance or permission to stay with the parent who has permission on the BN(O) Household Member route</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The child of a BN(O) Household Member must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>normally live with the BN(O) Household Member</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>live with a parent who has permission on the BN(O) Household Member route during their stay in the UK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying for entry clearance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold a valid TB test certificate when applying in country</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the maintenance requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, or the Isle of Man</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a dependent child is born in the UK to a BN(O) Household Member and/or their partner, who already have permission on the route, the BN(O) Household Member and/or their partner should apply for permission for the child and provide a full UK birth certificate showing the names of the childâs parents.</p>

<h4>Assessing the relationship</h4>

<p>The Household Member or their partner must show evidence that they are the parent, adoptive parent or guardian of the child, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a full birth certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an adoption certificate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a court order, such as a special guardianship order</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>BN(O) Adult Dependent Relative</h3>

<p>An Adult Dependent Relative is the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>parent aged 18 or over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>grandparent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>brother or sister aged 18 or over</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>son or daughter aged 18 or over</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>of a BN(O) status holder or BN(O) status holderâs dependent partner.</p>

<h4>Assessing high dependency</h4>

<p>Cases of exceptional high dependency can be considered outside of the definitions of dependants above (dependent partner/spouse, Household child, Household Member, partner/spouse of a Household Member, dependent child of a Household Member). Assessing high dependency is guided by, but not limited to, the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>their age, illness, or disability requires long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant normally lives with the BN(O) status holder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the applicant is unable to access care in Hong Kong, even with the practical and financial support of the BN(O) status holder or the BN(O) status holderâs partner/spouse</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can request further information to establish whether the dependent adult relative is part of the same household as the BN(O) status holder and the level of their dependency on the BN(O) status holder or the BN(O) status holderâs partner/spouse, such as evidence of medical conditions, how long have they been living together and how care is provided.</p>

<p>See the guidance on adult dependant relatives for further information.</p>

<h2>Grant or refuse entry clearance</h2>

<p>This section tells you about how to grant or refuse entry clearance on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route.</p>

<h3>Grant entry clearance</h3>

<p>If the applicant meets all of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">suitability</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark31">eligibility</a> requirements of Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas), you must grant entry clearance.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Official - sensitive: end of section</p>
</div>

<h4>Biometric information for entry clearance</h4>

<p>Successful applicants for entry clearance are given either a digital status or a vignette in their passport. If the entry clearance application is successful, you must issue a 90-day entry clearance vignette to allow them to collect their biometric residence permit (BRP) after they have arrived in the UK. If the vignette has expired, an applicant may <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-uk-visa-applicants-and-temporary-uk-residents#outside-uk">apply for a replacement vignette</a>.</p>

<p>Applicants collecting a BRP may choose to collect it from a different Post Office branch, but they will need to arrange this at the branch and pay a fee. For further information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits/collect">BRP guidance on GOV.UK</a>. BRPs may show an expiry date of 31 December 2024, even if the applicant has permission beyond that date. Further guidance will be issued in 2024 on how to update the BRP. Applicants do not need to contact the Home Office if their BRP shows an expiry date of 31 December 2024.</p>

<h3>Refuse entry clearance</h3>

<p>You must refuse the application if you are not satisfied the applicant has met all the suitability and eligibility requirements.</p>

<p>Consult the guidance on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route: refusal wordings for more information about refusing an application on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>If you require further information, you must discuss the case with your entry clearance manager who may refer to the BN(O) Route Policy team for further advice.</p>

<h3>Family members</h3>

<p>A family member applying for entry clearance can only be granted permission in line with the main applicant (BN(O) status holder) and so cannot be granted entry clearance if the BN(O) status holderâs application is refused. If the applications are granted, family membersâ permission will have the same expiry date as the main applicantâs permission.</p>

<p>A BN(O) status holderâs application may meet the suitability, and eligibility requirements but one or more of their family membersâ applications may not. In these cases, you must grant entry clearance for the applicants that meet the suitability and eligibility criteria and refuse those family members who do not.</p>

<h3>Crown Dependencies</h3>

<p>There is no legal provision to collect biometrics from applicants seeking to travel directly (i.e. not transiting the UK) to the Channel Islands. Biometrics must be enrolled at a visa application centre or UKVCAS service point if an applicant intends to transit the UK on the way to the Channel Islands. They cannot use the UK Immigration: ID Check smartphone app. However, applicants wishing to reside in the Isle of Man must enrol their biometrics at a visa application centre or UKVCAS service point regardless of whether they intend to travel directly to the Isle of Man or transit the UK. They cannot use the UK Immigration: ID Check smartphone app.</p>

<p>Applications to the BN(O) route of a Crown Dependency (CD) must be referred to the appropriate island for authority to issue or refuse by email using the Channel Islands and Isle of Man referral form. You must also include a recommendation in your referral. Send only a copy of the visa application form (VAF) with the referral form; the island will request supporting documentation if required.</p>

<p>BRPs are not issued by the CDs. All entry clearances are issued for the full period of permission granted. Applicants must not be instructed to collect BRPs.</p>

<p>For further information, please see the Common Travel Area guidance.</p>

<h3>Right to administrative review: entry clearance applications</h3>

<p>If an application for entry clearance is refused, the applicant cannot appeal against the refusal. However, if they think the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an administrative review.</p>

<h2>Grant or refuse permission to stay</h2>

<p>This section tells you when to grant or refuse permission to stay on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route.</p>

<h3>Grant permission to stay</h3>

<p>If the applicant meets all of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">suitability</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark31">eligibility</a> requirements, you must grant permission to stay.</p>

<h3>Biometric information</h3>

<p>Successful applicants for permission to stay are given either a digital status or a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/biometric-residence-permits">biometric residence permit (BRP)</a>.</p>

<h3>Refuse permission to stay</h3>

<p>You must refuse the application if you are not satisfied the applicant has met all the suitability requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas)</a>, or if any of the grounds for refusal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9: Grounds for Refusal</a> apply.</p>

<p>Consult the guidance on Example refusal wording for applications on the Hong Kong BN(O) route for more information about refusing an application on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>Where an application for permission to stay does not meet the eligibility requirements you must consider whether the following <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">exceptions</a> apply.</p>

<h3>Exceptions: leave outside the rules following a refusal</h3>

<p>If an applicant cannot meet the eligibility requirements for permission to stay because, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they cannot demonstrate they meet the financial requirement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are not ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK, Jersey, Guernsey or the Isle of Man</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>you must inform the applicant of the reasons why their application does not meet the eligibility requirements under Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas) using the relevant decision template. However, you have the discretion to grant the applicants 12 monthsâ leave outside the rules (LOTR) to allow them further time to meet the eligibility requirements for a further application for the Hong Kong BN(O) route. Family members should only be granted LOTR where the BN(O) status holder is also being granted permission.</p>

<p>This grant of LOTR does not apply if the applicant has not met all the suitability requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-changes-to-the-immigration-rules-hc-813-22-october-2020">the Hong K</a>ong British National (Overseas) route.</p>

<p>This grant of LOTR gives applicants the right to work and study in the UK, but no recourse to public funds. The conditions of their stay are set out in the relevant decision template.</p>

<p>BN(O) status holders and their family members who fell for refusal under the Hong Kong BN(O) route would be granted LOTR via the same application, meaning they would not have to pay again for a separate in country LOTR application. Hong Kong BN(O) applicants will have paid either 30 months or 5 years of IHS with their application, but would only receive 12 monthsâ permission, so you must refund the difference in IHS. They would not get a refund of the original application fee paid.</p>

<p>If you are considering granting LOTR you must discuss the case with your senior caseworker who may refer to the BN(O) Route Policy team for further advice.</p>

<h3>Right to administrative review</h3>

<p>If an application for permission to stay is refused, there is no right of appeal against the refusal. However, if the applicant thinks the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an administrative review.</p>

<h2>Conditions of entry clearance or stay</h2>

<p>This page tells you about the conditions of stay a Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status holder and their family members must comply with if they are granted entry clearance or permission to stay.</p>

<h3>No access to public funds</h3>

<p>Hong Kong BN(O) status holders and their family members are granted permission on the condition that they cannot access public funds and can maintain themselves. This term is defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-introduction">paragraph 6</a> of the Immigration Rules and includes most state benefits and housing or homelessness assistance. However, those who have been granted permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route who are destitute or are at imminent risk of falling into destitution can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-for-change-of-conditions-of-leave-to-allow-access-to-public-funds-if-your-circumstances-change">apply to change their conditions to lift the No Recourse to Public Funds condition</a>.</p>

<h3>Police registration</h3>

<p>BN(O) status holders are not normally required to register with the police, including when they also hold a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) passport. Holders of HKSAR passports, and holders of other specified passports over the age of 16, must be required to register with the police.</p>

<p>See the Police registration guidancefor further information.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

They cannot, however, be employed as a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-introduction">professional sportsperson or sports coach</a>.</p>

<h3>Study</h3>

<p>Hong Kong BN(O) status holders and their family members are allowed to study in the UK. There is no limit on the number of hours they can study or level of course they undertake. Study may be undertaken anywhere the applicant chooses and does not have to be with a licensed Tier 4 sponsor.</p>

<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>This section tells you how to assess an application for settlement (also known as indefinite leave to enter or remain) on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>Refer to the validity and suitability sections earlier in this document for more information on how to assess these requirements.</p>

<p>The guidance below explains how to assess the eligibility requirements for settlement, which are set out at paragraphs HK 57.1 to HK 63.1 in Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas).</p>

<h3>Qualifying period</h3>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent permission held by the applicant must have been on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>If the applicant has had permission on a route not listed here, you should check the immigration rules to see if it is a route that leads to settlement. For example, the Student route (previously known as Tier 4) and Youth Mobility Scheme are not routes to settlement.</p>

<p>In the case of applicants for settlement under the BNO route any periods of LOTR, including the BN(O) LOTR at the border concession which operated from 15 July 2020 to 19 July 2021, do not count towards the qualifying period.</p>

<p>Absences from the UK must be considered in line with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Continuous Residence</a>. See the continuous residence guidance for further details.</p>

<h3>Knowledge of life in the UK</h3>

<p>Unless an exemption applies, the applicant must meet the Knowledge of Life in the UK requirement as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-koll">Appendix KOL UK</a>.</p>

<h3>English language requirement</h3>

They must show that they meet the English Language requirement as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-english-language">Appendix English Language.</a></p>

<h3>Relationship requirement for applicants aged 18 or over who are not adult dependent relatives</h3>

<p>Where an applicant is aged 18 or over on the date of application, and their most recent permission was not as an adult dependent relative on the Hong Kong BN(O) route, the applicant does not need to meet a relationship requirement in order to apply for settlement.</p>

<p>The applicant must have last been granted permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route. The applicant does not need to apply for settlement at the same time as (or after) the BN(O) status holder; they may apply regardless of whether the BN(O) status holder has applied for settlement. Partners will not need to demonstrate that their relationship with the BN(O) status holder is subsisting on the date of application.</p>

<p>Applicants who are aged under 18 on the date of application or who are adult dependent relatives must meet the relationship requirements set out below.</p>

<h3>Relationship and care requirements for a dependent child on the Hong Kong BN(O) route</h3>

<p>This section tells you about the relationship and care requirements for a dependent child on both the BN(O) Status Holder route and the BN(O) Household Member route. These must be met where the applicant is under the age of 18 on the date of application.</p>

<p>The applicant must have last been granted permission as a dependent child on the BN(O) Status Holder route or the BN(O) Household Member route.</p>

<p>At least one parent of the applicant must be being granted settlement on the Hong Kong BN(O) route at the same time as their child or grandchild, or be settled, or a British citizen. Their other parent must be being granted settlement at the same time, be a British citizen, or be settled, unless one of the following exceptions apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>one parent is deceased</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one parent has sole responsibility for the childâs upbringing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are serious and compelling reasons to grant the child settlement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Serious and compelling reasons must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. You must consult your senior caseworker if you have doubts about granting. They may refer you to the BN(O) Route Policy team for further guidance.</p>

<p>There must be suitable arrangements for the childâs care and accommodation in the UK, which must comply with relevant UK legislation and regulations.</p>

<p>A child who has turned 18 since they successfully applied for entry clearance or permission to stay should apply as a BN(O) Household Member at settlement. As with other adult children, they will not need to demonstrate that they continue to meet a relationship requirement.</p>

<h3>Relationship requirement for a BN(O) adult dependent relative</h3>

<p>The applicantâs last grant of permission must have been as an adult dependent relative on the Hong Kong BN(O) route. The applicant must be the parent, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of a person who is being granted settlement on the Hong Kong BN(O) route; who has been granted settlement on the Hong Kong BN(O) route; or who is a British citizen.</p>

<h2>Grant or refuse settlement</h2>

<p>This section tells you when to grant or refuse settlement on the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) route.</p>

<h3>Grant settlement</h3>

<p>If the applicant meets all of the <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark28">suitability</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark31">eligibility</a> requirements, you must grant settlement.</p>

<h3>Grant permission to stay (where settlement requirements are not met)</h3>

<p>If an applicant does not meet the requirements for settlement, they may still meet all the suitability and eligibility requirements to be granted permission to stay on the Hong Kong BN(O) route. Where you consider it likely that the applicant would meet these requirements you must vary their application from an application for settlement under the Hong Kong BN(O) route to one to permission to stay.</p>

<p>When you do this, you must write to the applicant using template IHC Request Vary Settlement to Permission and notify them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they do not meet the requirements for settlement â you must not refuse the application at this point as if you do it may end any 3C leave the applicant has and prevent them from qualifying for settlement in future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>why they do not meet the requirements for settlement â explain which requirements they do not meet and why as you would in a refusal letter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you have varied their application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they must pay the Immigration Health Charge (IHC) within 14 days to be granted permission to stay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if they do not pay the IHC their application for permission to stay will be rejected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the application fee is retained regardless and explain they will not receive a refund</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You must check the IHS portal at the end of the 14 day period (starting from the date the notification is sent) to see if the IHC has been paid.</p>

<p>If the IHC has been paid and they meet all eligibility and suitability requirements, you should grant permission to stay for 30 months with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>no access to public funds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work (including self-employment and voluntary work) permitted except for employment as a professional sportsperson (including as a sports coach)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>study is permitted, subject to the ATAS condition in Appendix ATAS</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if Part 10 applies the applicant will be required to register with the police</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the IHC has not been paid you should reject the application and record this on the caseworking system. Where an application is rejected after this process the application fee is not refunded. In all cases the fee the applicant paid for their settlement application will be retained.</p>

<p>You will need to send the appropriate notification to the applicant using the relevant template (Validity rejection no write out).</p>

<p>If, before the 14 day period is over, the applicant contacts you to notify you that they believe there has been an error in the decision, you should consider any further information they provide only where this is relevant to the reason they did not meet the settlement requirement.</p>

<p>For example, where an applicant did not meet the qualifying period requirement because they were absent for more than 180 days in a 12 month period, and their absences were not for one of the reasons for permitted absences in Appendix Continuous Residence â the applicant may contact you with evidence that the absences over the 180 days were for a permitted reason.</p>

<p>In such a case you may grant settlement if all eligibility and suitability requirements are met.</p>

<p>If the applicant provides information that is not relevant to the reasons their application was refused you do not need to consider this and should follow existing guidance. You should, however, notify the applicant that you have not considered this information and why.</p>

<h3>Refuse settlement</h3>

<p>If the applicant does not meet the requirements for settlement or permission to stay <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules">Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas)</a>, or if any of the grounds for refusal in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-9-grounds-for-refusal">Part 9: Grounds for Refusal</a> apply you must refuse the application.</p>

<p>Consult the guidance on Example refusal wording for applications on the Hong Kong BN(O) route for more information about refusing an application on the Hong Kong BN(O) route.</p>

<p>Where an application for settlement does not meet the eligibility requirements you must consider whether any <a class="govuk-link" href="#bookmark77">exceptions</a> apply.</p>

<h3>Right to administrative review</h3>

<p>If an application for settlement is refused there is no right of appeal against that decision. However, if they think the Home Office has made an error in considering their application, they can apply for an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/ask-for-a-visa-administrative-review/if-youre-in-the-uk">administrative review</a>.</p>
