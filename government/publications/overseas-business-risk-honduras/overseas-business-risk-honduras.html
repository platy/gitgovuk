<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>General overview</h2>

<p>As one of the poorest and least industrialised countries in Latin America, Honduras is heavily dependent on agricultural products such as bananas, coffee and sugar, for its foreign exchange earnings. This makes the economy extremely vulnerable to commodity price and climatic changes.</p>

<p>Other key areas of the economy include manufactured goods produced by local assembly plants (maquiladoras), particularly in the textile industry, as well as tourism and the construction industry. In recent years, Honduras has registered the second highest economic growth rates in Central America, only behind Panama; 4.8% in 2017, 3.7% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019.</p>

<p>However, the global economic crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and the damages caused by tropical storms ETA and IOTA, coupled with the domestic challenges of violence and inequality, have had a strong adverse impact on the economy.</p>

<p>The pandemic and storms led to -9.5% economic growth in 2020.  Local economy has been recovering as Covid-19 restrictions are gradually being lifted, growing 11.5% in 2021 according to Honduran Central Bank; while remittances from Hondurans working in the US reached a new high of USD7.3bn in 2021, equal to over 20% of GDP.</p>

<p>In 2004 the government signed a ‘Letter of Intent’ for a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) with the IMF, which granted Honduras debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. To date, during Juan Orlando Hernández’ presidency, the government has continued to work closely with the IMF, which has kept up pressure on Honduras to strengthen fiscal policy, with the size of public expenditure a particular area of concern. In December 2014, the IMF approved a loan of almost USD 200m to support a three-year economic programme to maintain macroeconomic stability, improve sustainable economic growth conditions and reduce poverty.</p>

<p>The government is generally open to foreign direct investment (FDI) which it views as crucial for resuming sustained economic growth in the future. Yet FDI decreased from USD 961 million in 2018 to USD 498 million in 2019, reaching USD 16.5 billion of FDI stock in 2019 (UNCTAD World Investment Report 2020), and expected to continue decreasing as a result of the impact of the pandemic on the economy.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Politics</h2>

<p>Honduras, Central America’s second-poorest country, has one of the world’s highest homicide rates. Gangs and transnational criminal networks prey on communities but some improvements have been made to improve security. Its international image has also been undermined by extensive narcotics-related money laundering.</p>

<p>Capitalizing on a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that suspended a constitutional ban on consecutive presidential re-election, and an economy that is performing well, President Juan Orlando Hernández of the centre-right National Party was re-elected in November 2017.</p>

<p>Those results were disputed by the losing parties and the country is increasingly polarised as a result. However, the economy remains strong thanks to a dynamic private sector and remittances influx. Corruption allegations around the handling of the COVID-19 emergency has weakened the Government.</p>

<p>In the 2021 national elections, Xiomara Castro was elected President, becoming the first female president of Honduras and promising progressive reforms to tackle local challenges such as poverty, corruption and human rights.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Economics</h2>

<p>The Honduran economy is rated as low-middle income, according to the World Bank; having the fifth largest GDP of the seven Central American countries (USD 23.8bn in 2020). The economy grew by 2.7% in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and passage of tropical storms ETA and IOTA the economic growth decreased -9.5% in 2020. However, it rebounded to 11.5% in 2021. Family remittances (mainly coming from the US) play an important role sustaining domestic demand. It reached an all time high of USD 7.3bn in 2021, accounting for more than 20% of GDP.</p>

<p>Honduras faces major challenges with more than 70% of the population (9.7m inhabitants) living in poverty (2021). In rural areas, approximately six out of ten households live in extreme poverty or on less than USD 2.50 per day. The unemployment rate was 8.4% in 2020.</p>

<p>The government has been developing new strategies to increase employment, open markets and attract foreign investment that takes advantage of the opportunities such as its strategic location, a growing industrial base, a young population, and a desire to diversify exports. Rampant crime and violence add a major challenge. Although the number of homicides has declined recently, Honduras continues to have one of the world’s highest homicide rates; approximately 40 per 100,000 in 2021.</p>

<p>Honduras’ economy depends highly on international trade making it very vulnerable to external shocks. The country’s economic structure has not changed substantially, depending on the agricultural sector as the major source of employment. Its main trading partners are the United States, Central American countries and the European Union (in particular Germany).</p>

<p>Honduras continues to be an exporter of agricultural products and clothing manufacturing. Its main exports in 2021 were 56.3% agro industrial, 25.4% light manufactures, 12.7% agricultural, and 5.6% mining. Imports consist mainly of manufactured goods, fuels, energy, raw and construction materials. Total exports in 2021 were USD 5.2bn.</p>

<p>Foreign investment in Honduras is regulated by the Investment Promotion and Protection Act. This introduced national treatment and new guarantees for foreign investors, such as stability contracts, fiscal incentives and property protection regimes. However, there are some limits for foreign companies relating to which sectors they can operate in, since the state reserves exclusive rights to operate certain basic industries and public services (for public order and public interest reasons); eg activities related to public health, public drinking water supply, waste management, lottery, among others.</p>

<p>Despite the high level of violence and crime and high inequality, the Honduran investment climate has attracted big investors to the country, especially in the textile and tourism sector. Continuing to attract foreign investors after the COVID-19 pandemic and passage of tropical storms ETA and IOTA will be a challenge in the upcoming years.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Trade and investment between the UK and Honduras</h3>

<p>Trade between the UK and Honduras has been increasing over recent years, specifically after the introduction of the Central America Association Agreement with the European Union (EUCAAA) in 2013. Trade relations with Honduras are based on the UK-Central America Association Agreement that entered into force 1 January 2021.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/summary-of-the-uk-central-america-association-agreement">Read more information about the Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Total trade in goods and services (i.e. exports plus imports) between October 2020 and September 2021 totalled £139m. UK exports to Honduras amounted to £24m, while UK imports from Honduras were £115m.</p>

<p>More on the bilateral trade with Honduras can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trade-and-investment-factsheets">Trade and Investment Factsheets</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Potentialities of the market</h3>

<p>The government of Honduras has established a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://cni.hn/" rel="external">National Investment Council</a> that promotes the development of local and foreign private investment as a mechanism to generate economic growth and employment in Hondurans. The Council focuses in six priority sectors, which are receiving different types of incentives and represent opportunities for UK companies now.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/tourism/" rel="external">Tourism</a></h4>

<p>The main goal is to become one of the top destinations in the Caribbean with an exclusive combination of world-class infrastructure. This requires public (and private) investment in infrastructure, consulting services, connectivity (airports/airlines) and talented human resources. In August 2017, the National Congress of Honduras approved a new Tourism Promotion Law which includes a package of incentives for investment.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/textile-and-apparel/" rel="external">Textile and apparel</a></h4>

<p>Strongest industrial sector in Honduras, many foreign companies have become established in the country to manufacture clothes lines of top brands (e.g. Honduras is the number one worldwide cotton shirt and number two sweater volume exporter to the US market). Companies investing in this sector benefit from production incentives.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/light-manufacturing/" rel="external">Light manufacturing</a></h4>

<p>Light manufacturing production represents 9% of the total exports of the country and it has the potential to make Honduras the most dynamic country in the region. This sector benefits from the Free Trade Zone Law, which provides a variety of fiscal incentives, such as sales and income tax exemption.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/outsourcing-services/" rel="external">Outsourcing services (BPO’s)</a></h4>

<p>This sector has been identified as one of the fastest growing (6% annually); and even though their operations concentrate on North America, there are opportunities for consulting services, technical skills, English language, others (see more in 3.5.3).</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/agribusiness/" rel="external">Agribusiness</a></h4>

<p>The agricultural sector is the main motor of the country’s economy, employing 40% of the labour force and it has more potential to grow. The government is focusing on improving the value chain through the adoption of better standards, technology transfer and facilitation of higher value activities.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="http://honduras2020.com/key-sectors/social-housing/" rel="external">Social housing</a></h4>

<p>Honduras’ immediate plan is to benefit textile workers with 50,000 affordable homes but in the future the development of social housing is aimed at multiple sectors. This represents opportunities for urban planning, smart cities, logistics, consulting services, financial schemes, among others.</p>

<p>Another potential sector is the power generation industry; the country has natural resources that allow the development of renewal energy. In fact, several foreign investors are owners of power generation plants and some others have partnered with local companies. This sector benefits from tax incentives.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Tax and customs</h3>

<p>As from 1 January 2017 the Honduran corporate tax system is based on the territoriality principle. Companies, whether or not resident in Honduras, are subject to tax only on Honduran-sourced income. Companies domiciled abroad that have agents or representatives in Honduras are taxed in the same manner as residents on their income derived from activities undertaken in Honduras. Honduras does not have any double taxation treaties in force. These are the key taxes in the country:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income Tax: companies are subject to tax of 25%, known as the income on lucrative activities regime</li>
  <li>VAT: a standard rate of 15% is payable on domestic and imported goods and services (some supplies are exempt)</li>
  <li>Alternative Minimum Tax: companies and individuals resident in Honduras are subject to this tax. As from 2020, only companies performing general activities that generate  more than HNL 1bn will be subject to this tax at 1% rate; while special activities that generate more than HNL 1bn will be subject to this tax at 0.5% rate. Special activities include natural or legal persons who produce or market: cement, public services provided by state companies, pharmaceutical drugs, oil and its derivatives, bakery sector or industry, products derived from steel for construction, production, marketing and export of coffee. with gross income equal or greater than HNL 10m (USD 420,000 approx.) must pay 1.5% applied to their gross income</li>
  <li>Solidarity Tax: applicable only to taxpayers opting for taxes on income from lucrative activities (25% income tax scheme), they must pay 5% applied to gross income exceeding USD 43,956</li>
  <li>Transfer Pricing (TP) policies are applicable in Honduras. The government is entitled to determine differences between transactions done by related parties and others done by independent parties, if the company does not conduct a transfer pricing study. If the government identifies a difference, a 15% or 30% tax would be paid on such difference</li>
</ul>

<p>Four incentive programmes operate in Honduras to certain qualifying industries and operations. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free zones: tax exemptions on profit derived from sales to foreign countries are applied for 10 years to companies operating in Free Zones or under the Law of International Services, as long as the company has been approved by the Ministry of Economy. Also they are exempt from income tax for 10-20 years and from municipal income tax for 10 years</li>
  <li>export and draw-back activities: exemption from import taxes, VAT, income tax for industrial and commercial outfits established under this scheme are some of the incentives available for companies dedicated to export and draw-back activities</li>
  <li>free-trade zone and tourist zone: exemption from import taxes, VAT, and income tax exist for industrial and commercial companies established within free-trade zones in Honduras. Also, companies operating in the Bay Islands within the free trade tourist zone benefit from these incentives</li>
  <li>investment in renewable energy sources: Exemption of import taxes for 10 years, income tax for 12 years, income and value-added tax for 10 years, exist as incentives to develop renewable energy projects</li>
  <li>since the entry into force of the customs union between Guatemala and Honduras, authorities of both countries are present at both customs offices at the border to facilitate the movement of goods</li>
</ul>

<h4>Customs Union between Guatemala and Honduras</h4>

<p>The Customs Union between Guatemala and Honduras entered into force in June 2017; and in August 2018, El Salvador officially joined. This created a single customs territory of 242km2 and 34.8 million of inhabitants; figures that represent more than 68% of all Central America, including 69.4% of regional trade and 50.2% of regional GDP. This union means free transit of more than 75% of goods, by accelerating mobilisation of more than 95% of goods at the border with the use of a document for electronic transfer and payment of taxes in real time <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sieca.int/index.php/integracion-economica/integracion-economica/integracion-profunda-guatemala-honduras-elsalvador/fyduca/" rel="external">((FYDUCA))</a>.</p>

<p>This customs union only covers goods and 38 products are excluded. Among these are: alcoholic beverages, vehicles, living animals, chemicals, dairy, tobacco, cement, others. These products would use the regular customs documents and would have to go through the regular line at customs; whilst products included go through a special line and only use FYDUCA.</p>

<p>Free movement of people is not allowed yet.</p>

<p>Since the entry into force of the customs union, authorities of the three countries are present at customs offices at the respective borders to facilitate the movement of goods.</p>

<h4>Tax reform</h4>

<p>Since December 2016, when the new fiscal law was approved, Honduras has been upgrading its tax system. The reforms have focused on the creation of a specific independent body to collect tax; Servicio de Administración de Rentas (SAR) and a new tax code.</p>

<p>This reform has allowed the government to increase tax revenue by increasing indirect taxes (i.e. tax sales, fuel tax, etc.) while decreasing direct taxes and keeping the tax incentives high. However, the country still needs to implement policies that allow civil society to get more involved in how public funds are spent and transparent process for public spending.</p>

<h4>ZEDES</h4>

<p>In 2013, Employment and Economic Development Zones (ZEDES) were introduced; they are intended to be extraterritorial fiscal and customs zones with the possibility to develop their own internal policies and regulations (including fiscal and monetary). At the moment, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://prospera.hn/roatan/" rel="external">Roatán Próspera</a> is the first ZEDES under development.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Services: education</h3>

<ul>
  <li>approximately a third of Honduras’ population is between 18 and 35 years old</li>
  <li>approximately 45% of inhabitants are economically active (15 years or older)</li>
  <li>the Honduras literacy rate is approximately 89%</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ef.co.uk/epi/regions/latin-america/honduras/" rel="external">according to the English Proficiency Index</a>, Honduras English proficiency is ranked low. However, it is higher among young and urban generations</li>
  <li>second to Belize, Honduras has the largest number of bilingual schools in Central America</li>
  <li>Honduras has 6 public and 14 private universities</li>
</ul>

<h4>UK education offer in the country</h4>

<p>The British Council currently does not have an active presence in the country but does offer IELTS exams on specific dates to those interested. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.pearsoneducacion.net/honduras/inicio" rel="external">Pearson Education</a> is active in Honduras. Under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://becashonduras2020.gob.hn/" rel="external">Presidential International Scholarship Programme Honduras 2020</a> the government explored agreements with foreign universities for Hondurans to pursue postgraduate degrees in one of the six areas prioritized under Honduras 2020 and in health related specializations. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hondufuturo.org/" rel="external">Hondufuturo</a> has also established partnerships with UK universities to allow Hondurans to pursue postgraduate education in the UK.</p>

<h4>BPO sector</h4>

<p>The BPO sector (Business Process Outsourcing) employs around 20,000 people in Honduras. Progressively it has become an attractive investment destination for contact centre companies. The country has a large volume of private English-language schools which provide a good source of bilingual agents.</p>

<p>Whilst in neighbouring countries operations are mostly focused on a single urban centre, Honduras’ outsourcing sector has been established in multiple urban centres thus decreasing the risk of oversaturation. Moreover, the establishments of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://altiasmartcity.com/tegucigalpa/" rel="external">Altia Smart City</a> in Tegucigalpa and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://altiasmartcity.com/san-pedro-sula/" rel="external">Altia Business Park</a> in San Pedro Sula have offered investors state of the art facilities for interested businesses.</p>

<p>Solid efforts have also been made by the Honduran Government to foster a competitive commercial environment for this sector. In 2017 the government in collaboration with the Central American Technology University (UNITEC) set the goal to <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nearshoreamericas.com/honduras-train-another-4000-people-call-center-service/" rel="external">train 4,000 people for the call centre industry</a>. In addition, the BPO sector is one of the six key sectors promoted by the National Investment Council.</p>

<p>BPOs offer a wide range of services such as customer service, telemarketing, collections, data feeding outsourcing of financial and administrative services. Leading multinational companies such as Alorica, StarTek, KM2, Convergys and Knoah Solutions are situated in the country.</p>

<h4>Technical education</h4>

<p>Due to socioeconomic factors, limited access to secondary education, the rural/urban divide and gender barriers, many young Hondurans are unable to access higher education. Thus, strengthening the vocational education sector in the country is regarded as a top priority by both the private and public sector.</p>

<p>Established in 1972, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.infop.hn/" rel="external">INFOP</a> is the governing body of vocational training in Honduras. It is currently undergoing a full restructuring process in order to update its curriculum and facilities. It offers technical courses such as automotive mechanics, construction, refrigeration, electronics and carpentry, amongst others.</p>

<p>Private and public universities are also expanding and investing in their technical degree programmes. For instance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.unah.edu.hn/" rel="external">UNAH</a>, the largest public university, offers a broad range of vocational opportunities through over 47 of its university’s career programmes. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ceutec.hn/" rel="external">UNITEC</a>, a private university also offers technical programmes in areas such as English for call centres, nursing, web design and development and network installation.</p>

<p>Overall, demand to develop technical skills is increasing in areas such as English language, agriculture, hospitality and tourism, programming, 3D animation, handling of industrial machinery, electricity, health services and maintenance.</p>

<h4>Opportunities and challenges</h4>

<p>There are other education/English language opportunities in the country. For instance, English for business, teaching methodologies and development of specific course material. Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are opportunities for the UK to share expertise in  instructional design, teacher training and  development of distance learning platforms.</p>

<p>There are also a number of private schools and universities in Honduras who could establish partnerships with international education providers for their students to improve English language skills and immerse themselves in a foreign culture. UK institutions and their quality of education are highly regarded and recognized.</p>

<p>There are however several challenges in the education sector. One of them is the strong competition with other English language providers. Honduras has closer cultural and commercial affinity with the United States in comparison to the UK. The BPO sector also favours developing in house skills and focuses voice coaching on American clients.</p>

<p>Public entities are also unable to contract services over a certain amount without having to open a bidding process. They are unable to contract foreign companies without a legal registration in the country unless they are unique providers of a service. Thus, on most occasions UK education providers must seek and establish local partnerships to take forward such opportunities or opt to undertake a local registration process (see section 7 for further details).</p>

<h4>Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)</h4>

<p>The Public Private Partnerships framework in Honduras is the most developed of Central America. They have implemented several infrastructure projects, both urban and services projects using PPP in recent years. These are based on the General Law for the Promotion of PPPs (Decree 143-2010) that aims to manage and regulate the procurement processes that allow the public-private collaboration for the delivery of public works and services in order to increase investment that leads to economic development.</p>

<p>There are a number of such projects in the pipeline and others that have been completed: construction and operation of a new international airport; modernization of ports; electricity supply; government administrative centre; highway networks; among others. Additionally, there are small urban projects planned for small towns around Honduras.</p>

<p>In summary the procedure for undertaking a PPP project is as follows: A proposal from the public or private sector is submitted; feasibility studies are conducted; a final resolution from the Superior PPP Council and Ministry of Finance is given (to state if the project can be implemented through a PPP); the national unit for PPP projects designs and structures the project; the tender is opened and regulated by the PPP unit once the project is awarded, it needs approval from the President and the National Congress.</p>

<p>When the implementation phase starts the Supervisory Authority for PPPs (SAPP) regulates and evaluates the contractual delivery of the project. The fact that the project is approved by Congress and becomes law gives certainty for investors that the conditions of the contract won’t change arbitrarily.</p>

<p>The Honduran PPP law introduced a trust fund model that is often used to deliver PPP projects. This facilitates the financing of projects, but also means that each contract is designed individually, thus making the supervision process challenging for local authorities.</p>

<h4>PPP Project: International Airport Palmerola</h4>

<p>The new International Airport at Palmerola is the biggest and main airport of Honduras. It is located 70km from the capital, Tegucigalpa. This ambitious project is the core of the national plan to make Honduras the logistics centre of the Americas. The construction was done under the PPP model, through a concessionaire. The total amount of investment was around USD 163billion. Operations began in October 2021.</p>

<h4>Global trade and international agreements</h4>

<p>Honduras is highly dependent on international trade, and thus international trade agreements play an important role. It has been a member of the WTO since July 1995 and has signed 12 trade agreements (see table below), giving preferential treatment to more than 40 trade partners, including the UK. Its largest trading partners are the United States, Central American countries and the EU (in particular Germany). Moreover, Honduras has 11 bilateral investment treaties which support the protection and promotion of investment with commercial partners.</p>

<p>In addition, Honduras has been part of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) since 1983. The country has a legal framework to protect intellectual property rights which is based on two key laws: Industrial Property Law and Copyright and Related Rights Law.</p>

<p>Another three laws that strengthen this scheme: E-signature Law, Protection of New Varieties of Plants Law and the Law of the Implementation of CAFTA-DR (the FTA with the US obliged Honduras to modify some of the regulations in order to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights). Nevertheless, even though this legal framework exists, sometimes it is not properly enforced.</p>

<p>Companies interested in registering a trademark, patent, industrial design, copyrights etc., under the Honduran legislation need to approach the Directorate-General of Intellectual Property (DIGEPIH), attached to the Property Institute (IP), since it acts as the intellectual property office.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>Historically, Honduras has maintained an open and welcoming posture to international human rights agreements. The country has ratified and supported numerous resolutions. However, in practice it continues to face implementation difficulties. According to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/honduras" rel="external">Human Rights Watch World Report (2022)</a>, journalists, land and environmental defenders, as well as LGBT individuals are among those most vulnerable to violence.</p>

<p>The newly elected government will continue to develop its  National Action Plan (NAP) framework to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. However, the Ministry of Human Rights has flagged that it will focus on the third pillar, remedy and work together with the Ministry of Economic Development. . The UN Business and Human Rights working group visited Honduras in 2019 and made suggestions to all sectors in order to advance the NAP. The Ministry of Human Rights will lead the BHR efforts. However, due to financial restraints BHR NAP might advance at a slow pace.</p>

<p>From within the private sector, the creation of the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.andi.hn/comisiones-y-comites/comite-industrial-de-derechos-humanos/" rel="external">Industrial Committee of Human Rights</a> with the support of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.andi.hn/" rel="external">The National Association of Industries (ANDI)</a> is pushing forward the Business and Human Rights agenda. The dynamics between the private sector and the newly elected government are yet to be seen. Voluntary principles on Security and Human Rights are also gaining interest and are being embraced by several companies.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://fundahrse.org/fundahrse/que-hacemos/" rel="external">Honduran Foundation for Corporate Social Responsibility (FUNDAHRSE)</a> based in San Pedro Sula promotes corporate social responsibility initiatives within the private sector.

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Indigenous groups and investment projects</h3>

<p>Honduras’ indigenous population is composed of seven different groups: Lenca, Maya-Chortí, Tolupán, Pech, Tawahka, Miskitu and Nahua. In addition, there are another two different afro-descendent ethnic groups: Garifuna and a black English speaking population.</p>

<p>Although there is no up-to-date information on the indigenous population in Honduras, according to the 2001 national census 7% of the population were indigenous or of African descent. In 2007 indigenous organizations conducted a census in which it was discovered that the indigenous population or people of African descent amounted to 20% of the population.</p>

<p>In 1994 Honduras ratified ILO Convention 169. The Convention recognizes that due to different historical factors, indigenous and tribal groups have been unable to exercise their fundamental human rights to the same degree as the rest of the population.  It notes that governments should assume the responsibility to ensure that indigenous and tribal groups are able to exercise, under equal conditions, the rights and opportunities available to the rest of the population under local laws.</p>

<p>The Convention also establishes that the state should consult indigenous groups on all administrative or legal measures which could directly affect them. This includes but it is not limited to coordinating consultation processes between indigenous groups and companies looking to establish operations in their territories. In addition to affecting indigenous groups, the consultation process is also an issue which affects non–indigenous communities. Currently, there is no consultation law or existing regulation which outlines the steps to correctly undertake consultation processes.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="http://unsr.vtaulicorpuz.org/site/index.php/documents/country-reports/148-report-honduras" rel="external">Special Rapporteur’s report (2016)</a> on the rights of indigenous peoples in Honduras shed light on their critical situation. The report highlighted their vulnerability to acts of violence when claiming their rights over lands, territories and natural resources. In a context of general violence and impunity they lack access to justice.</p>

<p>Indigenous people have claimed that various energy projects, extractive projects, agro-industrial, tourism and infrastructure projects have infringed their rights as these projects had been taken forward without prior consultation and proper observance of international standards.</p>

<p>Amongst other observations and recommendations the Special Rapporteur emphasized that “before applying for permission or signing contracts relating to investment projects, companies should carry out studies on the presence of indigenous peoples in or around sites proposed for such projects and on the rights to lands, natural resources and prior consultation that indigenous peoples have under international standards.”</p>

<p>In late February 2022, the government announced the country will not allow mining permits and has declared the country free of open pit mining projects. In recent years, opposing mining projects has been deadly for environmental activists.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Advancements and challenges ahead</h3>

<p>To date the Honduran government has been unable to establish clear consultation regulations with indigenous communities. There have been several registered cases of social unrest, attacks against human right defenders, and the suspension or closure of projects. Particularly, the prosecution and murder of indigenous leaders who defend their lands is concerning.</p>

<p>The most internationally well known case is the recent murder of Lenca leader and environmentalist Ms.Berta Cáceres. Cáceres lead protests against the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project. Her murder is feared to be directly linked with her work in defence of the rights of Lenca people in relation to this project.</p>

<p>In November 2018, a court ruled that seven men, including an army major and the manager for social and environmental matters for Desarrollos Energéticos (DESA), were the material and intellectual murderers of Berta Cáceres. Although, the ruling was welcomed by civil society organizations, many still argue that the intellectual murderers, the owners of DESA  have not been properly charged. The court case against David Castillo, has been delayed multiple times and a final sentence is expected on 6 April 2022.</p>

<p>In the area of extractive industries several challenges persist. In 2013 the Honduran Government passed The General Mining Law (Decree No 32-2013) which established the Honduran Institute for Geology and Mines (INHGEOMIN). INHGEOMIN is legally mandated to manage the mining sector in accordance with EITI transparency principles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the General Mining Law was met with opposition from several communities and organizations in Honduras. Some of the main concerns raised were water sources communities depended on being left unprotected, mining not being prohibited in populated areas, limited access to information about technical and financial aspects of the projects and companies involved, amongst others.</p>

<p>In October 2020, Honduras was found to have made meaningful progress with considerable improvements in implementing the 2016 EITI Standard. However, due given to inadequate progress with civil society engagement, Honduras was suspended and was given 18 months to carry out corrective actions regarding industry engagement. The next validation will be carried out in April 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Rule of law and transparency</h2>

<p>Honduras continues to struggle to develop an effective rule of law and little improvements have been made on transparency issues. Resolution of title disputes in court often takes years, in part because of the judicial system’s weakness. Politically, the country remains polarized due to a contested election in November 2017 (see point 2).<br>
The instalment of the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity (MACCIH) gave some hope to boost transparency but internal differences and non-committal support from the Honduran government have impeded progress.</p>

<p>In November 2020, Honduras created the Secretariat of State in the Offices of Transparency to fight corruption. Its creation was done in a none-transparent way, and generally its creation was met by with criticism from civil society, private sector and other public institutions. One big issue is its setting because the executive oversees it and the President has the discretion to decide what is investigated and what is not.</p>

<p>On Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index Honduras scored 22, falling one position compared to 2020, and was highlighted as a country “to watch”, having experienced significant setbacks in the fight against impunity.</p>

<p>In February 2022, President Castro announced that her government had requested to the United Nations the creation and establishment of the International Commission Against Impunity in Honduras (CICIH).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Study Case: The Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH)</h3>

<p>In 2016 following months of protests demanding the fight against corruption to be taken forward by an independent organization, the Honduran government requested the Organization of American States (OAS) to establish <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.oas.org/es/sap/dsdme/maccih/new/default.asp" rel="external">The Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH)</a>. MACCIH aimed to improve the quality of services delivered by the justice system and to prevent and fight corruption and impunity in the country. The commission’s mandate includes selecting and overseeing a group of judges, prosecutors, police officers, and forensic scientists to pursue corruption cases.</p>

<p>During its first year MACCIH had several successes and began investigating several high profile corruption cases. The case of Los Cachiros linked former President Porfirio Lobos (2010-2014) and the cartel Los Cachiros as beneficiaries of hydroelectric projects the assassinated activist Berta Cáceres opposed. A second case named La Caja Chica de la Dama provided proof against former first lady Rosa Elena Lobos of creating a sophisticated money laundering network. As a result of the investigation she was arrested.</p>

<p>In early 2018 MACCIH requested the arrest of five congressmen and initiated an investigation against sixty congressmen potentially implicated in embezzlement of public funds. Shortly afterwards Congress passed a law which constrained and blocked MACCIH’s competencies transferring them to the National Audit Office, which is known to be influenced by political parties. Once the amendment was approved, the five congressmen who had been arrested were freed and the investigation of the other congressmen was suspended. The amendment also limits MACCIH’s ability to investigate bribes related to Odebrecht.</p>

<p>Following the approval of the new law MACCIH’s Head of Mission, Juan Jimenez, resigned citing a lack of support from authorities in Honduras and clashes with OAS leadership. Moreover, in March 2018 the Supreme Court accepted a challenge against the agreement which established MACCIH, adding further pressure to its work. 
MACCIH’s mandate ended in January 2020 after 14 cases against 113 individuals. Currently, the Special Prosecutor’s Unit Against Impunity of Corruption (UFECIC) continues to follow-up on corruption cases under threats and little support from local authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Security</h2>

<p>Despite the descending trend for murder rates over the last few years, figures are still high at 40 per 100,000 inhabitants (2021). Due to widespread extortion, crime and presence of gang members in some areas of the country, most businesses invest in private security. Experts estimated in 2013 that 70,000 private security agents were working in Honduras, exceeding the number of officers in the national police force, which at the time stood at 16,000. Public forces are unable to meet the growing security demand. <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.groupcsc.com/" rel="external">Group CSC</a> is a British private security company based in San Pedro Sula.</p>

<p>Recently the government has expanded the military’s role in combating violent crime by creating the Public Order Military Police Force (PMOP). This decision has been contested by several members of civil society and the National Human Rights Commission (CONADEH). In a December 2015 report, it listed complaints it has received against the Military Police and Army personnel alleging abuses that include killings, abductions, torture, rapes, and robberies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Regulatory environment</h2>

<p>Honduran laws on tax, labour, environment and health and safety do not forbid foreign investment or foreign companies to operate in the country. However there are some restrictions. If foreign companies want to operate in certain sectors; agriculture, fishery, forestry, etc., the company needs a majority ownership by Honduran citizens. 
Also, bureaucratic processes for obtaining certain permits and licences represent a challenge for foreign companies/investors that do not know how the system operates (in comparison to the domestic companies that are more familiar with such processes).</p>

<p>The Honduran Labour Code regulates the employer-employee relationship and sets the benefits and obligations that have to be met; these include: vacations, social security, working hours, minimum wage etc. The minimum wage is renegotiated on a multi-annual basis between the government, private sector and labour unions. It currently stands at a range of between HNL 7,000 – HNL 12,000 per month (approx. USD 280 – USD 480).</p>

<p>The maximum working hours are 8 hours per day and 44 hours per week, with at least one 24 hour rest period per week; 10 work days paid as vacations per year; two bonuses of two complete salaries per year (one in June and another one in December). Additionally, there is a requirement for all foreign companies to hire Honduran workers; at least 90% of the total workers have to be Honduran and at least 85% of the payroll has to be paid to Hondurans.</p>

<p>There is also the option of hiring temporary employees under the temporary employment law, but this has caused controversy in the past because it has been said that it is used often by companies that want to avoid responsibility of benefits for long-term employees. Labour legislation reforms are planned in the future.</p>

<p>There are price controls on some products, which are set temporarily by the government establishing a fixed price to guarantee their affordability. This is most commonly done in the holiday season when sellers increase prices to make more profit, on products such as beans, sugar, beef, poultry, etc. There are no exchange rate controls.</p>

<p>For a more comprehensive list of regulations and procedures, the Honduran government has created <a class="govuk-link" href="https://honduras.eregulations.org/?l=es" rel="external">this website</a> with the support of the international network of transparent investment procedures of UNCTAD.</p>
