<p>This guidance is for all childminders registered with Ofsted or a childminding agency.</p>

<p>It contains information on childminding when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone who lives with you is self-isolating because they have symptoms of COVID-19, has tested positive or are a close contact</li>
  <li>you cannot childmind in your home and you wish to consider alternative options to continue to childmind</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance also applies to childminders who work at a registered domestic premises that is not their home and the person self-isolating is living at the address the childminder is registered.</p>

<p>‘Domestic premises’ refers to any premises which are used wholly or mainly as a private dwelling.</p>

<h2>When someone who lives with you has COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive</h2>

<p>You cannot childmind in your home when someone living there has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any of the main symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>a positive test</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot childmind children in your home until everyone living with you who has symptoms, or a positive test, has finished self-isolating.</p>

<p>You should follow the guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19 infection</a>.</p>

<h2>When someone who lives with you is self-isolating as a close contact</h2>

<p>You can continue to childmind in your home if the person self-isolating is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person#what-is-meant-by-a-contact">close-contact</a> and are not <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#NotRequired">exempt from self-isolation</a> and all the following requirements are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the person self-isolating does not have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 or a positive test</li>
  <li>the person self-isolating does not have any contact with the children being cared for in the setting – for example they use a separate bathroom where possible, or if the person self-isolating has to use a shared bathroom or other communal areas, these must be thoroughly cleaned after every use</li>
  <li>you follow the <a href="#additional-actions" class="govuk-link">additional actions to take when someone you live with is self-isolating</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider further guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings outside the home</a>.</p>

<h2>Why children can attend the setting when they are living with a positive case</h2>

<p>It is important that we all take steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community to save lives and protect the NHS. When someone in a childminder’s household has any of the main symptoms of COVID-19, or a positive test, the childminder cannot care for children in their home. This is because there is a higher risk of transmission to those attending the provision for childcare as they are in close proximity of the case and for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to children (and adults) who must stay at home and not receive visitors into the home when they test positive or have symptoms. They can pass the infection to others, even if they have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which is why they must stay at home.</p>

<p>The success of the UK’s vaccine programme has allowed the government to ease self-isolation rules for fully vaccinated people and those aged under 18 years and 6 months. This enables both eligible childminders and children - when they are exempt from self-isolation - to leave their homes and visit other homes when someone they live with is self-isolating.</p>

<h2>Alternative childminding options when you cannot childmind at home</h2>

<p>You may wish to consider the following options, to continue childminding as long as you are not personally required to self-isolate and you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discuss and agree any option you might choose with parents and carers well in advance of such an event</li>
  <li>check you have adequate public liability insurance for the temporary change</li>
  <li>follow the <a href="#additional-actions" class="govuk-link">additional actions to take when someone you live with is self-isolating</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider further guidance in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings">COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings outside the home</a>.</p>

<h3>Another registered domestic premises</h3>

<p>If you want to work from another registered domestic premises such as another childminder’s home, you should tell Ofsted or let your Childminder Agency (<abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr>) know before you start. ‘Domestic premises’ refers to any premises which are used wholly or mainly as a private dwelling.</p>

<p>To notify Ofsted, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a> from an email address that is known to them. You should also notify Ofsted or your <abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr> if you intend to care for a child at the child’s own home.</p>

<p>You do not need to wait for an updated certificate to start working, but you must be able to demonstrate to parents or carers that you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered with Ofsted</li>
  <li>awaiting a new certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about childminder registration is available in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childminders-and-childcare-providers-register-with-ofsted/childminders-and-childcare-on-domestic-premises-registration">Ofsted’s registration</a>.</p>

<h3>Unregistered domestic premises</h3>

<p>If you want to work from another domestic premises which is not already registered, such as a relative’s home, you should tell Ofsted or let your <abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr> know before you start.</p>

<p>To notify Ofsted, please contact <a href="mailto:enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk</a> from an email address that is known to them. You should also notify Ofsted or your <abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr> if you intend to care for a child at the child’s own home.</p>

<p>This should only be considered if a longer-term option is required as any new people aged 16 or over who live and work on the premises where childminding will take place will have to be suitability checked. This includes the requirement to apply for a DBS certificate for each new person and at cost to the childminder.</p>

<p>You can tell Ofsted about new people using their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/childminders-report-new-adults-in-the-home">online service</a>. If you are registered with a <abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr>, contact them for more information.</p>

<h3>Non-domestic premises</h3>

<p>You can childmind from non-domestic premises for up to 50% of your time.</p>

<p>If you are registered with Ofsted, you must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/childcare-providers-eya-approval-to-operate-from-non-domestic-premises">complete an application form</a> and be approved before starting. If you are registered with a <abbr title="Childminder Agency">CMA</abbr>, contact them for more information.</p>

<h3>Public places</h3>

<p>You can continue to childmind if, for example, you were to collect children from school and take them to their parent or carer without taking them into your home. This could include an activity along the way, such as a visit to the park.</p>

<h3>Outbuildings and gardens</h3>

<p>If you are one of the very small number of childminders who have a suitable outbuilding or extension and garden within the boundary of your registered address, you may be able to childmind if you meet all the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the outbuilding or extension:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>has its own entrance/exit and you do not have to enter your home to access it</li>
      <li>does not have direct access to the main house</li>
      <li>is not being used by the person who is self-isolating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you can continue to deliver the statutory requirements of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2" class="govuk-link">early years foundation stage framework</a> including:
    <ul>
      <li>the environment being safe and suitable for the children and does not compromise safeguarding, their welfare or their individual needs</li>
      <li>there is access to a toilet and washing facilities and (where appropriate) adequate sleeping facilities - all of which are separate to those being used by the person self-isolating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you discuss your arrangements with Ofsted before you start</li>
  <li>you follow the <a href="#additional-actions" class="govuk-link">additional actions to take when someone you live with is self-isolating</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional actions to take when someone you live with is self-isolating</h3>

<div role="note" class="application-notice help-notice" aria-label="Warning">
<p>This section should not be read in isolation to the rest of this guidance.</p>
</div>

<h4>Communication</h4>

<p>You should make every effort to  notify parents and carers of the children attending the setting, and any assistants, about the self-isolation, as soon as reasonably possible and maintain open communication with them throughout the period of self-isolation.</p>

<h4>Risk assessments</h4>

<p>You must comply with health and safety law by reviewing your risk assessment. The risk assessment must demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the provision of childcare in your setting is safe</li>
  <li>how it aligns with the control measures in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#control-measures" class="govuk-link">actions for early years and childcare providers during the covid-19 pandemic</a>
</li>
  <li>how you will put into place any additional but proportionate measures</li>
</ul>

<p>Further guidance is available in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the section on risk assessments in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#stepping-measures-up-and-down">actions for early years and childcare providers during the covid-19 pandemic</a>
</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-and-safety-advice-for-schools/responsibilities-and-duties-for-schools" class="govuk-link">health and safety: responsibilities and duties</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Monitoring</h4>

<p>You should have arrangements in place to monitor whether the measures you have put in place are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>effective</li>
  <li>working as planned</li>
  <li>reviewed frequently</li>
  <li>updated appropriately, for example when any issues are identified, or when there are changes in public health advice</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>You must report positive cases to Ofsted or your childminding agency.</p>

<p>Guidance is available in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#other-considerations-for-operating-the-setting" class="govuk-link">actions for early years and childcare providers during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic</a>.</p>
