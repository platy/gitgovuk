<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As part of the government’s COVID-19 Enhanced Protection Programme, an independent advisory group (<abbr title="independent advisory group">IAG</abbr>) was commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care to identify people who are at the highest risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. These are mostly people whose immune system mean they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, despite vaccination.</p>

<p>Individuals within these defined groups are eligible to receive new COVID-19 treatments, such as neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs) and antivirals, if they test positive for COVID-19 via a lateral flow test (reported via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">report a COVID-19 rapid lateral flow test result page</a> or 119) or PCR, and have not been admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>This document supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-risk-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-treatments-independent-advisory-group-report">Higher-risk patients eligible for COVID-19 treatments: independent advisory group report</a> published on 30 May 2022. It contains information on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the highest risk patient groups</li>
  <li>how some of these individuals will be identified and contacted automatically (or ‘digitally’) if they test positive for coronavirus</li>
  <li>details of which groups can be identified digitally and those that cannot</li>
  <li>guidance for accessing treatment for eligible people who cannot be identified digitally</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>You can find public-facing information about how to access COVID treatments on the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.nhs.uk/CoronavirusTreatments" rel="external">NHS website</a>. This page also provides information on accessing lateral flow test kits for people who are eligible to receive the new COVID-19 treatments.</p>
</div>

<h2>The highest-risk patient groups</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="independent advisory group">IAG</abbr> has identified that people in the following groups may be eligible for COVID-19 treatments. Not all people within these groups are eligible for treatment. Rather, people within these groups will need to fulfil specific criteria relating to their condition (or treatments received for their condition) to be eligible for treatment.</p>

<p>These groups are regularly reviewed and currently include some people who have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chromosomal disorders affecting the immune system, including Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>certain types of cancer or have received treatment for certain types of cancer</li>
  <li>sickle cell disease</li>
  <li>certain conditions affecting their blood</li>
  <li>chronic kidney disease (<abbr title="chronic kidney disease">CKD</abbr>) stage 4 or 5</li>
  <li>severe liver disease</li>
  <li>had an organ transplant</li>
  <li>certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease)</li>
  <li>HIV&nbsp;or&nbsp;AIDS&nbsp;who have a weakened immune system</li>
  <li>inherited or acquired conditions affecting their immune system</li>
  <li>rare neurological conditions: multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease or myasthenia gravis</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional criteria, including certain conditions not listed above, apply to children and young people (<abbr title="children and young people">CYP</abbr>) in order to be eligible to access these treatments. Families of potentially eligible <abbr title="children and young people">CYP</abbr> will be informed by their specialist clinician of their eligibility and provided with information on accessing treatment.</p>

<p>This list was developed based on clinical evidence of poorer outcomes from COVID-19 in the specified groups and expert agreement on the risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 despite vaccination. It is important to note that this list is different from the list of health conditions that previously identified people as ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ or those that were advised to shield.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>It is also different from the list of health conditions that make someone eligible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-vaccine-people-with-severely-weakened-immune-system/" rel="external">third primary dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or a spring or autumn booster</a>
</li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhs-at-home/covid-oximetry-at-home/" rel="external">COVID-19 Oximetry at home service</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Digital identification process</h2>

<p>The digital identification process allows people who are potentially eligible for treatment to be quickly identified after a positive COVID-19 test.</p>

<p>Conditions in the list above should be recorded in a patient’s electronic medical record, in the form of a code. The team at NHS Digital and NHS England have identified a list of codes which reflect some of the eligibility criteria to receive treatments for COVID-19.</p>

<p>When a person tests positive for COVID-19 (that is, they have registered a positive lateral flow or receive a positive PCR test result), nationally held data will be searched for the list of codes and/or rules to determine if they are potentially suitable for treatment for COVID-19. If they are found to have a code or fulfil a rule that means they are potentially suitable for treatment, their nearest COVID Medicine Delivery Unit (<abbr title="COVID Medicine Delivery Unit">CMDU</abbr>) will be alerted that they have tested positive and will contact the person to discuss potential treatment.</p>

<p>Patients identified by the digital identification process are only potentially suitable for treatment, and not all patients identified will go on to be offered treatment for COVID-19. This may be due to any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not all individuals with their condition are considered to be at highest risk of severe illness from COVID-19</li>
  <li>the digital identification process was designed to identify as many patients as possible that may be eligible for treatment. Sometimes this means capturing individuals that fulfil some, but not all of the eligible criteria for COVID-19 treatments</li>
  <li>their symptoms may already be improving when assessed for suitability for treatment</li>
  <li>an individual’s nationally held data may be out of date. For example, they currently no longer have the condition that previously made them eligible for treatment, or are no longer on a medication or within a specified time frame from having received a medication that previously made them eligible for treatment</li>
  <li>there may be a delay updating nationally held data from the person’s medical record</li>
  <li>an individual’s clinical codes may not accurately reflect their conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to offer treatment to potentially suitable individuals will be made by a clinician from the <abbr title="COVID Medicine Delivery Unit">CMDU</abbr>. On receiving an alert of a potentially suitable patient, the <abbr title="COVID Medicine Delivery Unit">CMDU</abbr> will contact them with a list of questions to decide whether or not treatment is beneficial.</p>

<p>Unlike the clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) list, there is no nationally maintained ‘list’ of people who are potentially suitable to receive COVID-19 treatments. Every individual in the UK testing positive for COVID-19 will have nationally held data searched for the list of codes and/or rules to determine if they may be potentially suitable for treatment.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/treatments" rel="external">See full technical methodology on the NHS website</a></p>

<h2>Guidance for people who cannot be identified digitally</h2>

<p>Not all people who are potentially suitable for COVID-19 treatments will be identified digitally.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup> This may be because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some conditions may not have associated codes in the nationally extracted data from an individual’s electronic medical record</li>
  <li>they have only recently been diagnosed so national data is not yet updated. For example, a new diagnosis of a disease can take months to update in the national data</li>
  <li>an individual’s clinical codes may not accurately reflect their conditions</li>
  <li>an individual’s conditions have not been recorded using clinical codes</li>
  <li>an individual is on hospital-only medication, that is not extracted nationally</li>
</ul>

<p>These people will be identified through the non-digital route.</p>

<p>These people should be informed by their specialist of their potential suitability to receive treatment, with information on how to access treatment if they test positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you are potentially suitable for COVID-19 treatments but have not been contacted about treatment within 24 hours of your positive test, you should contact your GP surgery, 111 or specialist. They will be able to make an urgent referral to a <abbr title="COVID Medicine Delivery Unit">CMDU</abbr> if needed.</p>

<p>The table below lists the patient groups that may be potentially suitable for COVID-19 treatments according to the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>conditions that are currently being picked up by the digital identification process</li>
  <li>conditions currently not picked up by the digital identification process, but will soon be added to the digital route</li>
  <li>conditions that cannot be picked up by the digital identification process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital patient groups</h3>

<p>This table will be updated as NHS Digital further refines the list of codes and rules used to identify potentially eligible patients.</p>

<p>People who have conditions that are identified digitally and automatically referred for assessment are not guaranteed treatment.</p>
