<h2>What is coronavirus?</h2>

<p>Coronavirus is a virus which can make you feel poorly.</p>

<p>Coronavirus can make older people and people with some health conditions more poorly.</p>

<p>People with a learning disability are also more likely to become poorly if they get coronavirus.</p>

<p>It is really important to keep ourselves and others safe from coronavirus.</p>

<p>Coronavirus is sometimes called COVID-19.</p>

<p>One way we can keep ourselves safer and healthier this winter is by having our coronavirus and flu vaccines to help stop us getting very poorly.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus booster vaccine</h2>

<p>Some people will be offered a coronavirus booster vaccine. This booster vaccine will keep you safer for longer.</p>

<p>The people who will be offered it are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who are 50 years old or older</li>
  <li>health and social care workers</li>
  <li>registered carers</li>
  <li>people who are at more risk because they have certain health conditions. This includes people who are 16 years old or older and are on the Learning Disability Register</li>
  <li>people who are autistic and have some types of health conditions which could make them more poorly if they got coronavirus</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is a booster vaccine important?</h2>

<p>The protection from the coronavirus vaccines doesn’t last forever in your body, so it is important to get your booster vaccine to help keep you safe for longer.</p>

<h2>When should you have a booster vaccine?</h2>

<p>If you are in <a href="#eligibility" class="govuk-link">one of the groups above</a>, you will be called by your doctor to have your booster 6 months or more after your second coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>The second vaccine will still help to keep you safe until you get your booster.</p>

<p>Your doctor might suggest that you get your flu vaccine at the same time as your booster vaccine. This is safe to do.</p>

<h2>What type of booster vaccine will you be offered?</h2>

<p>There are many different types of coronavirus vaccines.</p>

<p>You might not get the same type of vaccine as you had before, but you will be given the one that is right for you.</p>

<h2>Some things you might feel after your booster vaccine</h2>

<p>After having the booster you might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a painful, or heavy feeling in the arm where you had your vaccine for 2 or 3 days</li>
  <li>have a headache</li>
  <li>find that your muscles hurt or you are feeling tired</li>
  <li>feel like you have the flu</li>
</ul>

<p>If this happens you should rest and take paracetamol if you can. Check with someone if you are not sure and always make sure you follow the information on the box.</p>

<p>You may feel hot or cold, but this should not last more than 2 or 3 days. If you feel very hot or cold and poorly for more than a few days and have other coronavirus symptoms stay at home. You should do a coronavirus test in case you already have coronavirus. Ask someone to help you if you need to.</p>

<p>If you need support, but it is not an emergency, then ring 111.</p>

<p>Call 999 in the case of an emergency.</p>

<p>A few people have had problems with their hearts after having the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. These are 2 types of coronavirus vaccines. This has mostly happened in young men in the first week after their vaccine. Most people felt better after resting and having some simple treatments.</p>

<p>You should ring 999, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are finding breathing difficult</li>
  <li>you have chest pain, or your heart is beating in a different way than usual after you have had your booster vaccine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is there anyone who should not have a coronavirus booster vaccine?</h2>

<p>It is safe for most people to have the coronavirus booster vaccine.</p>

<p>If you were very poorly after having your other coronavirus vaccines, you should talk to your doctor.</p>

<h2>Can you still catch coronavirus after having the vaccine?</h2>

<p>The booster vaccine doesn’t stop everyone from getting coronavirus, but if you do get it, it should stop you becoming very poorly.</p>

<p>It may also take a few days for your body to get some protection from the booster.</p>

<h2>If you have not had your first 2 coronavirus vaccines</h2>

<p>If you have not had your first 2 coronavirus vaccines, you should have them as soon as you can.</p>

<p>To book your vaccines speak to your doctor to book an appointment and tell them about any reasonable adjustments you may need.</p>

<p>If you want to get your vaccines at your local pharmacy or at a large vaccination centre, call 119 or <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">book online</a>.</p>

<p>After you have had 2 vaccines, you will need your booster after 6 months.</p>
