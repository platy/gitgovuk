<h2>What is COVID-19 or coronavirus?</h2>
<p>COVID-19 is a new illness. It is sometimes called coronavirus.</p>

<p>Most people will get better from coronavirus at home but some people can get very poorly and have to go to hospital. Sadly, sometimes people can die from coronavirus.</p>

<h2>Signs of coronavirus:</h2>

<p>Some signs of coronavirus are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new cough and you keep on coughing</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>your smell or taste going away or changing</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the symptoms above, stay at home and arrange to have a test.</p>

<p>Further <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">information on symptoms</a> is available on NHS.UK. If you cannot use the NHS website, phone 111 free of charge.</p>

<h2>About the vaccine</h2>

<p>The coronavirus vaccine is an injection.</p>

<p>You will need 2 injections of the vaccine, which will be up to 3 to 12 weeks apart.</p>

<p>The vaccine has been tested to make sure it is safe.</p>

<h2>Who should have the coronavirus vaccines</h2>

<p>Some people are more likely to get poorly from coronavirus than other people.</p>

<p>All adults and some children are being offered the vaccine.</p>

<p>Some people who are more likely to get poorly include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people living in a care home for the elderly</li>
  <li>people aged 65 years and over</li>
  <li>adults with Down’s syndrome</li>
</ul>

<h4>The vaccine will be also offered to adults with these health conditions:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>problems with your kidney or liver</li>
  <li>heart conditions</li>
  <li>some brain conditions</li>
  <li>breathing problems like severe asthma (needing steroid tablets)</li>
</ul>

<p>This list doesn’t cover everybody. If you are more likely to get poorly, you should have been told by your doctor.</p>

<p>If you have a condition that makes you more likely to get very unwell from coronavirus and have not yet been vaccinated you should make an appointment to have them now.</p>

<p>Health and social care staff should also have all their vaccines.</p>

<p>If you are a paid or main carer for a vulnerable person you should also get the vaccine. This will help to protect you and the person you care for.</p>

<h2>Knowing if you should get a vaccine</h2>

<p>Your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> should be able to tell you if you should get the coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>Some people may receive a letter, or a phone call to invite them for their vaccination.</p>

<h2>How to book your appointment</h2>

<p>Your invitation letter will explain who to call for your appointment.</p>

<p>Use the telephone to make your appointment.</p>

<p>You will get told where to go for your vaccine and when.</p>

<p>Some people may be asked to go to a primary care hub to have their vaccine (primary care hubs are places where you can get your coronavirus vaccine that are run by your local <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> services)</p>

<p>If you’re not sure, speak to your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> (family doctor).</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<p>When you’ve had the first injection, you will get told where and when to go for your second injection.</p>

<p>You should have a record card with your next appointment written on it for an appointment in 3 to 12 weeks’ time.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give you good protection, you need the second dose to get longer-lasting protection.</p>

<p>Keep your card safe and make sure you go to your second appointment to get your second injection.</p>

<h2>How long the vaccine takes to work</h2>

<p>It can take a few weeks for the vaccine to protect you.</p>

<h2>Does the vaccine work for everyone?</h2>

<p>The vaccine doesn’t completely stop everyone getting coronavirus, but if you do still catch coronavirus it shouldn’t make you as poorly if you’ve had the vaccine.</p>

<h2>Allergies</h2>

<p>If you have serious allergies, you should check with your doctor if it is safe for you to get the vaccine. You might have a serious allergy if you carry an EpiPen.</p>

<h2>Pregnant or think you may be</h2>

<p>Some women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may have the vaccine.  If you are trying for a baby, you can still have your vaccines. Talk to your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> or midwife about it.</p>

<h2>Problems with your immune system</h2>

<p>The vaccine is safe if you have problems with your immune system (this is when your body finds it hard to fight infections).</p>

<h2>Side effects of the vaccine</h2>

<p>Very common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your arm feeling heavy or sore where you had the injection</li>
  <li>feeling achy or like you’ve got the flu</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>having a headache</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel feverish (like you’re very hot or very cold) you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rest</li>
  <li>take some paracetamol</li>
</ul>

<p>You should feel better in less than a week.</p>

<p>You cannot catch coronavirus from the vaccine but it is possible to have caught coronavirus and not realise until after your vaccination appointment.</p>

<p>If you are feeling very poorly or you’re worried you might have coronavirus, call 111 or go on the <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">111 website</a>. Make sure you tell 111 that you have just had your coronavirus vaccine</p>

<p>If NHS 111 tell you to see a doctor or a nurse, make sure you tell them about your vaccination too. If you can, show them your vaccination card.</p>

<p>If you think you have a serious side effect from the vaccine you can report them using the yellow card scheme. The <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus Yellow Card system</a> is a website where you can report any side effects from the vaccine. You may need support to access this website.</p>

<h2>Do you need the COVID-19 vaccine if you’ve had the flu vaccine?</h2>

<p>It’s important to have the flu vaccine and the coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>You can have both vaccines on the same day. You can also have them on different days if you need to.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are not well when it is your next appointment</h2>

<p>If you are not feeling well, wait to have your vaccine when you feel better.</p>

<p>You should try to have it as soon as possible. You can call the same number that you used to make your first appointment.</p>

<p>You should not attend a vaccine appointment if you are self-isolating, waiting for a coronavirus test or unsure if you are fit and well.</p>

<h2>Can you give coronavirus to anyone after you have had the vaccine?</h2>

<p>The vaccine can’t give you coronavirus.</p>

<p>Having the vaccine makes you less likely to get very ill from coronavirus.</p>

<p>The vaccine helps to protect you and those around you from catching and passing on the virus.</p>

<h2>You still need to:</h2>

<p>You do not have to social distance but you and the person who care for may still want to.</p>

<p>You do not have to wear a face mask. You can still wear one if it makes you feel safer, especially in crowded spaces.</p>

<p>Wash your hands carefully and often.</p>

<p>Open windows to let fresh air in.</p>
