<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political and Economic</h2>

<p>The Republic of Iraq is a democratic federal parliamentary republic. The federal government is made up of the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The country is composed of 18 governorates with elected governors and provincial councils. The Kurdistan Region is a constitutionally recognised semi-autonomous zone with executive, legislative and judicial powers, aside from those exclusive to the federal government. They are supposed to be allocated an equitable share of national revenues, and have the right to run their own internal security forces. National elections took place on 10 October 2021 and provincial elections, long delayed, are expected to take place in 2022. Executive authority lies with Prime Minister Mustafa Al Kadhimi, who succeeded the resigned Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. PM Kadhimi is leading a caretaker government until the formation of a new government in Spring 2022. The Head of State is President Barham Salih who was appointed in October 2018 after a Parliamentary vote.  The Speaker of Parliament is Mohammed Halbousi.</p>

<p>The Government of Iraq is still recovering from the challenges of fighting Daesh, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fluctuation in the oil prices. A substantive proportion of the liberated urban areas, particularly those in the north need significant support and reconstruction. The Government, along with assistance from the UN and the International Community is focused on ongoing stabilisation efforts, to prevent terrorist activity from returning. Daesh remains active in some form inside Iraq particularly in the Disputed Territories. Shia and other militia are also part of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), which were formed to fight Daesh, and remain active across the country. The PMF retain considerable autonomy, along with varying levels of influence over national and local government in Iraq, including over Government procurement.</p>

<p>Relations between the Iraqi federal government and the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) have improved since the independence referendum of 2017. Budget transfers and oil revenues remain contentious, with the implementation of a law to resolve the status of the territories disputed between federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government a particularly sensitive issue. The government of the KRI has a positive relationship with the federal government in Baghdad with mutual visits and meetings of delegations of both governments. Internal political tensions between the two major parties in the KRI led to them running independently in the 2021 elections. The budget distribution and the revenues of the oil sold by the KRI have been partially solved.  The next challenge now is to make serious steps towards resolving the Disputed Territories between provinces of the KRI and other provinces.</p>

<p>Iraqâs economy faces significant structural issues, with these driving longer-term instability. Following an oil crash in 2020, high oil prices have alleviated the immediate risk of economic collapse but dependence on oil - which in 2021 constituted 37% of Iraqâs GDP, 84% of government revenue and 96% of exports<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> - is not sustainable in the medium term with global demand for oil set to reduce significantly as energy production transitions away from hydrocarbons. Together with climate shocks and significant demographic pressure, this will exacerbate existing issues of corruption, unemployment and an inefficient public sector leading to increased instability. The previous administration, in particular the Minister of Finance, tried to agree an IMF programme however there was insufficient political will. This is likely to remain the case in the short term, especially given the current lack of an urgent balance of payments crisis.</p>

<p>Iraqâs private sector is substantially underdeveloped, reflecting the extremely challenging business environment: systemic corruption, lack of access to finance, and an overly burdensome regulatory and tax system. Iraq ranked 172 out of 190 in the World Bankâs Doing Business Index<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, putting it as one of the worst 20 countries in the world to do business. Private credit to GDP is below 10%<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>  and Iraq is in the worst 5 countries globally with regards to access to credit (186 out of 190)2; Iraq is also ranked in the top 20 most corrupt countries in the world<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>. Reforms to tackle these issues and promote greater private sector development is required.</p>

<p>The latest IMF estimate<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup> is that, in 2021, the economy grew by 3.6%; this was after a contraction of 15.7% in 2020, with Iraqâs GDP not expected to recover to pre-COVID levels until 2023. In 2022 Iraq is expected to have the highest growth rate in the Middle East and Central Asia (MECA) region<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> at 10.5%, but this reflects one of the largest regional impacts of COVID and a sluggish recovery in 2021. However, GDP/capita, in real terms, is not expected to recover to pre-COVID levels until at least 2026; reflecting demographic pressures (population growth of 2.6% annually).</p>

<p>The Government of Iraq (GoI) has made commitments over recent years to carry out structural economic reforms to diversify the economy and promote the private sector. In October 2020, the GoI launched its White Paper on Economic Reform; this is a credible and ambitious economic plan that the UK (and the G7, World and IMF) supports. However, since then, the only major reform has been devaluation of the Iraqi dinar. The recent increase in the oil price has sapped appetite for reform, as has the transition to a new government.</p>

<p>There are particular economic challenges after the liberation of territory from Daâesh, which resulted in significant damage to infrastructure and property. The World Bankâs Damage and Needs Assessment estimated the cost of rebuilding at US$88 billion over 5 years. Iraq received pledges of around $30bn (loans and grants) at a reconstruction conference hosted by Kuwait in February 2018. Few of these pledges have been implemented.</p>

<p>Overall the political, economic and security situation remains fragile in Iraq, however the situation in Baghdad has improved in recent years. Movement is restricted and outside central Baghdad and the KRI, companies nearly always travel with close protection security teams. Despite this, commercial opportunities are significant as the country continues to rebuild its infrastructure and main institutions. Sizeable contracts have been and continue to be signed with UK businesses sufficiently robust and strategically placed to do business in Iraq.</p>

<p>Total trade in goods and services (i.e. exports plus imports) between the UK and Iraq was Â£626m in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2021, a decrease of 8.2%, or Â£56m, from the four quarters to the end of Q3 2020. UK exports to Iraq amounted to Â£450m (a decrease of 21.5%, or Â£123m, from the four quarters to the end of Q3 2020) while UK imports from Iraq were Â£176m (an increase of 61.5%, or Â£67m, from the four quarters to the end of Q3 2020).</p>

<p>Of all UK exports to Iraq in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2021, Â£343m (76.2%) were goods and Â£107m (23.8%) were services.</p>

<p>The top five goods exported from the UK to Iraq to the end of Q3 2021 were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>54 â Medicinal and pharmaceutical products (Â£62.4m, or 18.2% of all UK goods exported to Iraq)</li>
  <li>77K â Miscellaneous electrical goods (capital) (Â£35.7m or 10.4%)</li>
  <li>11 â Beverages (Â£21.8m or 6.4%)</li>
  <li>71EK â Electric motors (capital) (Â£20.9m or 6.1%)</li>
  <li>74K â General industrial machinery (capital) (Â£18.8m or 5.5%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Iraq is an upper middle-income country, but with rapidly deteriorating development indicators compounded by acute exposure to climate change and rapid population growth. Structural reform and investment, particularly in the private sector, is urgently needed to diversify the economy from oil, increase investment in basic services and allocate capital more efficiently to the private sector. However, the investment climate is weak.. Corruption, bureaucracy, limited financial intermediation and inability to deploy major capital investment efficiently undermines the investment climate. The need for capacity building at Ministry, Governorate and workforce level exacerbates the challenges, with institutional effectiveness comparable to a low-income country. The security situation is another factor UK companies need to consider before entering the market.</p>

<p>The Government has launched the Enhanced International Support Service (EISS) for the Middle East region, including Iraq. This brings together the best of the private sector through the creation of an approved network of providers. These offer a range of professional and commercial services to UK companies looking to do business in Iraq.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Business and human rights</h2>

<p>Iraq has acceded to seven of the eight fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization concerned with human rights, including: the convention on the Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining; the conventions on Forced or Compulsory Labour; and the conventions for the Abolition of Child Labour.</p>

<p>Interventions supported by the international community have improved the overall human rights and humanitarian environment. Iraqâs military campaign to drive out Daesh from previously held territory has ended the well documented and horrific abuses committed by Daâesh such as abductions, sexual violence, torture, the use of human shields and executions in the areas over which it held control. Over half of Internally Displaced Peoples have felt safe enough to return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives, but 1.2m people remain displaced. The Iraqi Government must now stabilise liberated areas while reintegrating and rehabilitating displaced people to ensure that previous perceptions of inequality do not persist and violence resurface.</p>

<p>We welcome the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Governmentâs commitment to conduct full and transparent investigations into all alleged abuses and violations, including by Iraqi Security Forces including Popular Mobilisation Forces, Federal Police and the Kurdish Peshmerga.</p>

<p>Official statistics on the use of the death penalty are not made available to the public. However, NGOs and media report a rise in the number of people sentenced to death and executed in recent years. Executions were for terrorism offences or alleged roles in mass killings.</p>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office has designated Iraq as a Country of Human Rights Concern; further information in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/human-rights-and-democracy-report-2014">FCDO Annual Human Rights report</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Bribery and corruption</h2>

<p>Bribery is illegal. It is an offence for British nationals or someone who is ordinarily resident in the UK, a body incorporated in the UK or a Scottish partnership, to bribe anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be liable for the conduct of a person who is neither a UK national nor a resident in the UK nor a body incorporated or formed in the UK. In this case it does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere. The GoI has made efforts to tackle bribery and corruption in Iraq. The Iraqi Commission of Integrity is mandated to investigate government corruption and provides the means for anonymous reporting of corruption. Yet limited punitive action is taken to tackle allegations of government corruption. Corruption remains a significant risk to UK companies operating in the Iraqi market. Iraq ranks low on Transparency Internationalâs Corruption Perception Index (157/180).</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Intellectual property</h2>

<p>Iraq is a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization. Iraq is also signatory to the Arab Agreement for the Protection of Copyright and Arab Intellectual Property Rights Treaty. It is currently an observer to the World Trade Organisation after having requested accession in September 2004. However, enforcement of intellectual property rights is challenging in Iraq and there are ongoing cases of IP infringement relating to the Food &amp; Drink sector in KRI.</p>
