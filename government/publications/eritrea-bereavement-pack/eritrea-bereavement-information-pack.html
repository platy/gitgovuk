<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majestyâs Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>

<h3>How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h3>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7, any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 020 7008 5000.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, you can find the contact details of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">nearest British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate online</a>.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance we can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. Please note that if there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications.</p>

<p>If the death of a British national in Eritrea is reported to us and their next of kin is not present, we will ask the UK police to notify the next of kin as soon as possible. If the next of kin is not in the UK, we will ask our consular staff in the country where they are to do this.</p>

<p>The British Embassy will do whatever they can to trace the next of kin as soon as possible and would normally ask the UK police to tell you if your loved one has died. However, you might be notified about the death directly by someone else, for example a doctor, a social worker or a police officer.</p>

<p>We will do everything we can to make sure the next of kin does not hear about the death first from the media, although we cannot always influence this. In exceptional circumstances, this may mean having to notify next of kin about the death over the phone.</p>

<h3>Release of information to next of kin</h3>

<p>The authorities will usually notify the Embassy of the death of a British National in Eritrea. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to notify the next of kin as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Consular officers will normally have to obtain information about the death of your relative or friend on your behalf. We will try to obtain as much information as possible, although the amount of detail provided by the authorities can be very limited. We may also be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>Access to information such as the cause of death may be restricted until the evidence (such as post-mortem and police reports) has been reviewed. For a natural death, this process is normally reasonably straightforward and will be concluded in days or weeks. If there is suspicion around the cause, the investigation may take longer and as such getting access to information might be more difficult.</p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>

<p>It is very important to check if the person who died had insurance. If they had insurance, contact the insurance company as soon as possible. They may have a list of approved funeral directors to help you make arrangements, or be able to cover some of the costs.</p>

<p>If the deceased was insured you should contact the insurance company to establish if they are able to cover for the repatriation or funeral expenses and make the necessary arrangements. You may need the insurance policy number and the associated 24-hour medical emergency contact number to do this. You should establish whether the insurance company will appoint a local or international funeral director. Normally this process works well, but if there are concerns about the local funeral director, we may be able to assist.</p>

<h2>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If you decide to repatriate the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>.</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Eritrea, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-funeral-directors/list-of-english-speaking-funeral-directors-in-eritrea">list of English speaking funeral directors in Eritrea</a>.</p>

<h2>Identification of the deceased</h2>

<p>In Eritrea, it is normal for the deceased to be identified visually by the next of kin. Embassy staff may be able to accompany you and provide support during this process.</p>

<h2>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. A local death certificate, can be issued by the Eritrean authorities at next of kinâs request The cause of death given on the death certificate often lacks detail and may not always state the underlying cause.</p>

<p>You will usually need to produce documents about you and the person who has died, which give information such as full name, date of birth and passport number. Death certificates are issued in English. Burial or repatriation cannot take place without first obtaining the death certificate.</p>

<p>The local death certificate can normally be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. You can, however, sometimes apply for a consular death registration. This is not mandatory and cannot be used in place of a death certificate from the country where the person died. It is only available in some countries. If you wish to do this, you can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-death">more information and apply online</a>.</p>

<h2>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>Autopsies are always carried out for unexpected or sudden deaths. The only exception is at the discretion of the hospital doctors for natural deaths of overseas citizens who have family in Eritrea.</p>

<p>In cases of sudden or unexpected death, for example by accident or misadventure, or where a person dies unattended, the police will prepare an initial report of their findings. A copy is usually sent to the next of kin or the Embassy, but this is not always the case. If the death is deemed a criminal act, the police will be ordered to conduct a full investigation.</p>

<p>During an autopsy, samples of organs can be removed for testing, including toxicological studies, at the discretion of the doctor without the next of kinâs consent. The next of kin may not be informed about the removal of these samples. All organs which are removed as part of an autopsy are usually put back after the process is finished.</p>

<h2>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>Mortuary and refrigeration facilities are available in Asmara (Orota and Hailibet hospitals), Massawa and Assab only. Standards and facilities are not the same as you would find in the United Kingdom.</p>

<h2>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation.</p>

<h3>Letter of Release</h3>

<p>Local authorities generally require an authorisation/facilitation request letter (Letter of Release) from the Embassy for the next of kin, undertaker or other authorised representative before they release a body for cremation/repatriation/burial.</p>

<p>The Embassy will need written confirmation from the next of kin, informing the Embassy who they have requested to organise the funeral/repatriation, before the Letter of Release can be issued.</p>

<h3>Repatriation</h3>

<p>Repatriation cost vary depending on the type of coffin and service selected.</p>

<h3>Local burials</h3>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Eritrea, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-funeral-directors/list-of-english-speaking-funeral-directors-in-eritrea">list of English speaking funeral directors in Eritrea</a>.</p>

<p>If the remains are to be buried in Asmara, the cost of the casket varies from 500 to 700 Eritrean Nakfa (approximately Â£25 - Â£35). Wooden caskets vary from 1500 to 4000 Nakfa (approximately Â£75 - Â£200). Additional fees including for collection and transportation of remains, funeral home charges, administrative fees, and the cost of a burial plot in a public cemetery, may be as high as 5,000 Nakfa (approximately Â£250).</p>

<p>Relevant laws regarding death records are provided under Act 104-116 of The Transitional Civil Code of Eritrea.</p>

<h3>Local Cemeteries</h3>

<p>Local religious representatives and local undertakers can advise on available burial grounds. The most commonly used local cemeteries in Asmara are Tsetserat, Enda Mariam, Gejeret Abi, Hazhaz and Edaga Hamus-Islamic cemetery.</p>

<p>The following are required to obtain a burial plot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no objection and/or facilitation latter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Eritrea</li>
  <li>local death certificate</li>
  <li>passport of the deceased Payment</li>
  <li>payment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<p>Personal effects are normally returned to next of kin, or their authorised representative, without any formalities. If personal effects need to be returned to the UK and next of kin are not present in Eritrea, the undertaker can assist with making arrangements by commercial means. The undertakers will pass on any costs incurred to the next of kin directly so it is important to make sure you have explored and discussed options with funeral director or undertakers directly.</p>

<p>Please note, the British Embassy cannot take responsibility for personal belongings.</p>

<h2>Steps to take in the UK</h2>

<p>You can find more information online regarding steps to take in the UK. This includes information on arranging the funeral, informing the government of the death, UK pensions and benefits, and dealing with the estate of the deceased. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">step-by-step guide on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the deceased should be cancelled with Her Majestyâs Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a âD1 formâ. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send it</a>.</p>

<p>If you plan to repatriate the person who died to the UK, you may require their passport. In these circumstances, you should cancel the passport after they have been repatriated.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<h3>Child death</h3>

<p>There are no specific procedures for the death of a child in Eritrea.</p>

<h3>Deaths in road traffic accidents</h3>

<p>The traffic police will issue a report on the circumstances of the accident. Please note that it may take months for this to be issued.</p>

<h3>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h3>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter, a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including referring you to specialised organisations. You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/helping-british-people-abroad-murder-and-manslaughter">find out more about what they can do</a>.</p>

<p>You should note that, if the death is deemed murder or manslaughter, and the deceased is repatriated to certain parts of the UK, a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on UK Coroners and inquests below.</p>

<h3>UK Coroners and inquests</h3>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England or Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on whether to hold an inquest is made by Her Majestyâs Coroner. Please note, an inquest only takes place in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is buried or cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<p>Note that Procurators Fiscal and Coroners do not have jurisdiction in another country, nor do they seek to apportion blame to a named individual.</p>

<p>You can find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">Coroners and the Procurator Fiscal in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office guide on Death Abroad</a>.</p>

<h3>Legal aid</h3>

<p>Legal Aid is not available for legal representation in Eritrea.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>

<p>The Eritrean government does not have a comprehensive statutory or administrative scheme for compensating victims of crime. You may wish to consult a local lawyer to advise you how to seek compensation.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack">information on UK compensation for victims of terrorism overseas</a>.</p>

<h3>Translation and interpretation</h3>

<p>While English is spoken in Eritrea, local languages - mainly Tigrigna and Arabic - are used widely.</p>

<p>See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eritrea-list-of-lawyers/list-of-english-speaking-translators-in-eritrea">list of English-speaking translators and interpreters in Eritrea</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional support</h2>

<h3>Local support organisations</h3>

<p>There is no charity or organisation in Eritrea that can provide information, support or advice to bereaved families.</p>

<h3>Support organisations in the UK</h3>

<p>In the UK, there are many organisations that can help bereaved families. Some of these are listed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">Coping with death abroad guide</a>.</p>
