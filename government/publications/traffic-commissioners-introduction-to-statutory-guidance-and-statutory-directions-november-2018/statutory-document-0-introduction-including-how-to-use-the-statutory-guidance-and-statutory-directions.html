<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Guidance</h2>

<p>The Senior Traffic Commissioner for Great Britain issues the following Guidance under section 4C(1) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 (“1981 Act”) and by reference to section 1(2) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 (“1995 Act”) to provide information as to the way in which the Senior Traffic Commissioner believes that traffic commissioners should interpret the law relating to the application of the Statutory Documents. This Guidance may be subject to decisions of the higher courts and to subsequent legislation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Goods Vehicle Legislation: The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995</h3>

<p>It is unlawful in Great Britain to use a goods vehicle on a road, for the carriage of goods, either for hire or reward or in connection with any trade or business carried out by the user, without holding an operator’s licence, unless permitted to do so by a legal exemption.</p>

<p>A licence issued under section 2(1) of the 1995 Act is regarded as an operator’s licence as confirmed by section 58. Section 58 relies on this definition when interpreting two categories of operator’s licence:</p>

<p>“heavy goods vehicle licence” refers to an operator’s licence that authorises the use of one or more heavy goods vehicles (whether or not it also authorises the use of one or more light goods vehicles;</p>

<p>“light goods vehicle licence” refers to an operator’s licence that authorises the use of only one or more light goods vehicles.</p>

<p>The type of licence required depends on the type of use. Under section 3(2) of the 1995 Act the use of a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for hire or reward; or</li>
  <li>in connection with any trade or business,</li>
</ul>

<p>requires a standard operator’s licence, unless covered by a legal exemption.</p>

<p>Under section 3(3) of the 1995 Act the use of a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods that is solely for or in connection with any trade or business, other than that of carrying goods for hire or reward, requires a restricted operator’s licence (unless covered by a legal exemption).</p>

<h4>Heavy Goods Vehicles</h4>

<p>Section 2(1) of the 1995 Act provides that no person shall use a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods:</p>

<p>a) for hire or reward; or<br>
b) for or in connection with any trade or business carried on by him, except under a licence issued by this Act.</p>

<p>Section 58 defines “goods vehicle” as a motor vehicle constructed or adapted for use for the carriage of goods, or a trailer so constructed or adapted; “carriage of goods” includes the haulage of goods and “goods” includes goods or burden of any description.</p>

<p>Section 5(6) of the 1995 Act states that unless specifically permitted a vehicle which is not specified after a period of a month beginning with the day on which the vehicle was first in the operator’s lawful possession or, if later, the day on which the licence came into force is not authorised to be used under that operator’s licence.</p>

<p>Regulation 33 and Schedule 3 to the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 sets out the classes of vehicle for which an operator’s licence is not required (see Annex 2). The difficulty in determining the exemptions is illustrated in R (on the application of VOSA) v William Raymond Kayes [2012] EWHC 1498 (Admin), in relation to a “showman’s goods vehicle”. Any use, seeking to benefit from one of the exemptions, must fall exclusively within the exemption. Any operation outside of an exemption requires an operator’s licence no matter how short the period.</p>

<p>There are a number of other exemptions that enable an operator, established in Northern Ireland (The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Temporary Use in Great Britain) Regulations 1996) or in EU Member States, to use a goods vehicle for hire or reward, in Great Britain, without contravening section 2.</p>

<p>Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 defines the extent to which non-resident carriers from EU Member States are permitted to operate national road haulage services (i.e. cabotage). Cabotage operations must be completed within the seven days following the last unloading of an incoming international journey and using the same tractor unit. Where a foreign based haulier applies for an operator’s licence in Great Britain that haulier will become a ‘resident carrier’ (2000/063 Reids Transport Co Ltd) and subject to the ongoing obligations to comply with domestic law.</p>

<p>Section 262 of the Transport Act 2000 introduced Schedule 1A into the 1995 Act, so that any laden goods vehicle operating on a public road for the carriage of goods (either for hire or reward or in connection with any trade or business) without the authority of a goods vehicle operator’s licence, can be detained. (See Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on Impounding)</p>

<h4>Light Goods Vehicles</h4>

<p>As part of the obligations under the UK/EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement, the UK is obliged to implement changes to operator licensing so that UK goods operators continue to enjoy commercial access to EU markets. As part of these changes, from 21 May 2022, goods vehicle operator licensing regimes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be extended to cover light goods vehicles. This will include vehicles, such as vans or pick-up trucks, which weigh more than 2.5 tonnes and up to 3.5 tonnes in maximum laden weight (or permissible laden mass, which is the equivalent term in EU Legislation) (either alone, or combined weight when used with a trailer) and which operate internationally, for hire or reward.</p>

<p>Operators that fall within this category will be required to hold a standard international licence and meet most of the same requirements as those that operate heavy goods vehicles. One of the mandatory requirements is to engage a transport manager who is of good repute and professionally competent. The Secretary of State can grant temporary exemptions from the requirement for transport managers to hold a Certificate of Professional Competence to individuals who can demonstrate they have been managing light goods vehicle fleets for a continuous period of at least 10 years prior to 20 August 2020. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-temporary-transport-manager">https://www.gov.uk/apply-temporary-transport-manager</a></p>

<p>The operating centre and advertising requirements do not apply in the same way to operators which exclusively run light goods vehicles. (See Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on Operating Centres) Operators of light goods vehicles are required to meet different levels of financial standing. (See Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on Financial Standing)</p>

<p>The amendment to the current legislative framework does not affect LGVs used exclusively within the UK, or those which are not used within the UK or internationally for hire or reward (e.g. vans used by tradespersons such as plumbers or electricians transporting only their own tools).</p>

<p>Schedule 1A into the 1995 Act applies to vehicles used without authority of an operator’s licence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Passenger Carrying Vehicles Legislation: The Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981</h3>

<p>Section 12(1) of the 1981 Act provides that a public service vehicle shall not be used on a road for carrying passengers for hire or reward except under a PSV operator’s licence granted in accordance with the following provisions of this part of this Act.</p>

<p>Section 1(1) of the 1981 Act provides that a “public service vehicle” means a motor vehicle (other than a tram car) which:</p>

<p>(a) being a vehicle adapted to carry more than eight passengers, is used for carrying passengers for hire or reward; or<br>
(b) being a vehicle not so adapted, is used for carrying passengers for hire or reward at separate fares in the course of a business of carrying passengers.</p>

<p>Section 47 of the Local Transport Act 2008 introduced Section 12A and Schedule 2A into the 1981 Act so that any passenger carrying vehicle, adapted to carry more than eight passengers, operating on a public road for the carriage of passengers (either for hire or reward or in connection with any trade or business) without the authority of a PSV Operator Licence, can be detained.</p>

<p>Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 (of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC) does not apply to businesses engaged in road passenger transport services exclusively for non-commercial purposes or which have a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator. Non-commercial use means the carriage by road, other than for hire or reward or for own account, for which no direct or indirect remuneration is received, and which does not directly or indirectly generate any income for the driver of the vehicle or others and where there is no link with professional activity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Licensing of Operators</h3>

<p>A traffic commissioner is responsible for issuing licences in each traffic area on the basis of undertakings given by the applicant. The system aims to ensure road safety and fair competition through the safe and proper use of goods and public service vehicles and the protection of the environment around operating centres. An operator’s licence is required to:</p>

<p>i) carry goods (or burden) connected with any trade or business, if using a motor vehicle on a road with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a gross plated weight of more than 3.5 tonnes; or</li>
  <li>if it has no gross plated weight, but an un-laden weight of more than 1525kg;</li>
  <li>a vehicle and trailer combination exceeding 3500kgs maximum authorised mass, for hire or reward. (Exemptions under Schedule 3(2) of The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 for ‘dual purpose’ vehicles such as cars, estates, some pickups, and domestic 4x4 and others below 2040kg un-laden. EU Directives 2009/40/EU and 2014/45/EU have removed some roadworthiness testing exemptions, see the Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988.)</li>
</ul>

<p>or,</p>

<p>ii) carry goods (or burden) connected with any trade or business, if using a motor vehicle on an international journey with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a gross plated weight of more than 2.5 tonnes and up to 3.5 tonnes; or</li>
  <li>a vehicle and trailer combination exceeding 2500kgs and up to 3500kgs maximum authorised mass, for hire or reward.  (Exemptions under Schedule 3(2) of The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 for ‘dual purpose’ vehicles such as cars, estates, some pickups, and domestic 4x4 and others below 2040kg un-laden. EU Directives 2009/40/EU and 2014/45/EU have removed some roadworthiness testing exemptions, see the Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) Regulations 1988.)</li>
</ul>

<p>or,</p>

<p>iii) to use a vehicle for hire or reward:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which is adapted to carry more than eight passengers; or</li>
  <li>if not so adapted is used in the course of a business for carrying passengers who are charged separate fares.</li>
</ul>

<p>An operators’ licence is necessary even if the vehicle is only used for a short period of time.</p>

<p>An operator’s licence is granted on trust that the operator will comply with the licence requirements. So, operators are expected operators to meet the conditions on the licence and the undertakings given to obtain or renew the licence. If they fail to do so at any point in the life of the licence, a traffic commissioner can take regulatory action against an operator’s licence, including revocation, suspension or curtailment where an operator fails to live up to the expected standards.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>Role of the traffic commissioners</h3>

<p>The traffic commissioners are regulators of the road transport industry in Great Britain. They act as licensing authority and regulatory tribunal under the Operator Licensing regime.</p>

<p>Traffic commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of State under section 4 of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981. The Secretary of State may appoint any number of commissioners for England and Wales as the Secretary of State considers appropriate; and to appoint a single commissioner for the Scottish traffic area. The appointment processes for Wales and Scotland may be the subject of additional protocols with the respective devolved Governments. One of the traffic commissioners is appointed by the Secretary of State to act as the Senior Traffic Commissioner under section 4A of the 1981 Act.</p>

<p>Schedule 2 of the 1981 Act provides for deputy traffic commissioners who are deployed as deputy traffic commissioners for Great Britain, whilst a deputy traffic commissioner for the Scottish Traffic Area is able to undertake reserved matters within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

<p>Great Britain is divided into eight traffic areas. The Senior Traffic Commissioner has powers under section 4B of the 1981 Act to deploy any traffic commissioner or deputy traffic commissioner in England and Wales; and the Scottish traffic commissioner, in respect of any reserved matters, throughout the jurisdiction. The Senior Traffic Commissioner may require any traffic commissioner to carry out such of the reserved functions of traffic commissioner as the Senior Traffic Commissioner may determine and at any place in the jurisdiction. The Senior Traffic Commissioner may similarly determine the extent to which a deputy traffic commissioner will carry out those functions and where. Section 4(4) provides that any traffic commissioner must act under the Statutory Directions of and have regard to any Statutory Guidance given by the Senior Traffic Commissioner.</p>

<p>A traffic commissioner for England and Wales may exercise the functions of a traffic commissioner in any traffic area in England and Wales; and may exercise any reserved matters in the Scottish Traffic Area. The Scottish traffic commissioner may exercise the same functions of a traffic commissioner in relation to the Scottish Traffic Area, and England and Wales, in addition to which the Scottish traffic commissioner may exercise devolved functions allocated under devolved legislation.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Relevant Powers of the Senior Traffic Commissioner</h3>

<p>Section 4(4) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 and section 1(2) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 require that traffic commissioners act under general directions of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and, in contrast, that they shall have regard to any guidance issued by the holder of that office.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Senior Traffic Commissioner has two relevant powers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 4C(1)(a), the power to issue guidance; and</li>
  <li>section 4C(1)(b), the power to issue general directions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst both provisions are directed at traffic commissioners, they are separate powers and the statutory documents are therefore separated in to Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions. Subsection (2) of the 1981 Act provides an indication of what might be the subject of guidance, and subsection (3) in respect of general directions. Whilst these lists are not exhaustive there is a clear implication that Parliament intended that those matters covered by subsection (2), namely guidance, should not be the subject of directions and vice versa. It is therefore through Statutory Guidance that the Senior Traffic Commissioner can indicate the meaning and operation of any enactment or instrument.</p>

<p>The Documents containing the Senior Traffic Commissioner’s Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions (“Statutory Documents”) were first issued in December 2011 to coincide with the implementation of EU Regulation 1071/2009.</p>

<p>The construction of the Statutory Documents reflects the different powers of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and how they impact those that fall within the traffic commissioners’ jurisdictions. The application of the Regulators’ Code is limited in terms of the traffic commissioners’ duties and not relevant to judicial decision making. However, I am obliged to have regard to it when developing policies and procedures. The Statutory Documents describe the application of legal discretions and indicate a proportionate approach to the imposition of regulatory burdens and in doing so provide guidance and advice to those operators and drivers who are regulated by traffic commissioners. In developing the guidance, account is taken of the general duty to promote growth. This fits well with the stated intention to ensure fair competition through a consistent approach to the regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>The Statutory Documents therefore provide greater transparency to the way in which traffic commissioners approach their judicial duties and the licensing and other work conducted outside the tribunal room. They also set the framework for instructions to members of staff acting in support of the traffic commissioners.</p>

<p>The Statutory Documents are clearly defined. They are published as an available resource for all applicants, operators, transport managers, vocational drivers, and other interested parties. The other Statutory Documents are as follows:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>Use of Case Law</h3>

<p>The Upper Tribunal has recognised that the Statutory Documents provide a useful starting point.  They are intended to provide a consistent basis for decision making and have been developed with regard to the Regulator’s Code. As the Upper Tribunal has made clear, in considering regulatory action a traffic commissioner needs to reflect on what is required as a deterrent, not only to the individual party but to others within the industry.  However the Code has limited application to individual tribunal decisions.  The Upper Tribunal (and its predecessor) has stated on many occasions that each case must be considered on its own merits. Consistency of approach should not be mistaken for uniformity of decisions.  Inevitably the legal concept of proportionality (which requires traffic commissioners to weigh the facts as they find them from the evidence before them and to determine what is the appropriate direction to make based on the objects of the legislation) means that each case will involve a collection of different and variable factors. This is not always well understood, even within the regulated industries, and its effect is that the Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions often provide starting points for anticipated action by traffic commissioners.</p>

<p>Any interpretation of the law can only be current as at the date of publication. Annex 1 summarises the position following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. In the absence of definitions within the legislation the Statutory Guidance relies on case law to assist traffic commissioners. The nature of appeals from the decisions of traffic commissioners means that points of law are not always fully argued before the Upper Tribunal. Where the appeal is fully argued, for instance where the Secretary of State or another party has been permitted to be represented, that case provides a potentially binding precedent. In other cases, the Senior Traffic Commissioner has sought to identify and apply principles or an approach to an issue which might also assist traffic commissioners in their deliberations. Inevitably the footnotes cannot provide an exhaustive list of the relevant provisions and case law, for which it may be best to refer to the digest of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://administrativeappeals.decisions.tribunals.gov.uk/Decisions/trafficCommissioners.htm" rel="external">the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal</a>. Where it may be necessary to refer to another Statutory Document this is also indicated.</p>

<p>In referring to the decisions of the Upper Tribunal the citations relied upon throughout the Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions are those which accord with the search facility provided on the HM Courts and Tribunal Service web site, so as to ensure accessibility. Here are links to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://transportappeals.decisions.tribunals.gov.uk//Aspx/Default.aspx" rel="external">decisions from before January 2016</a></li>

</ul>

<p>There are long-established common law duties on tribunals to ensure the sufficiency of reasons (see Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on the Format of Decisions). The Supreme Court has held that the duty to give reasons may go beyond the tribunal (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IESC/2012/S59.html" rel="external">Ghandi Nawaf Mallak v Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform [2012] IESC 59</a>) The Statutory Guidance in particular should assist traffic commissioners in identifying useful case law. The Statutory Directions should give confidence to staff members to make prompt decisions, particularly when acting under delegations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7 </span>Operator Licensing Case Law</h3>

<p>In considering whether an operator’s licence is required, the first question is whether the operator is carrying goods or carrying passengers. (See Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on PSV Operations) For instance, a tractor unit is a goods vehicle. A tractor unit conveying empty trailers to and from the testing station amounts to the carriage of goods because ‘goods’ includes burden of any description. The hauling of trailers by a tractor unit for the purposes of testing and repair as part of a trade or business requires an operators’ licence. A tractor unit is a separate vehicle from a trailer and can only fall within an exemption if it is proceeding to the testing station for the purpose of a test upon itself. (2002/134 WC Commercials Ltd, Booth v DPP [1993] R.T.R. 379) The Upper Tribunal has indicated that a strict approach should be taken when applying exemptions from the requirement for an operator’s licence.</p>

<p>Under section 1(5) of the 1981 Act a vehicle is to be treated as carrying passengers for hire or reward if payment is made for, or includes, the carrying of passengers, irrespective of the person to whom the payment is made including on behalf of a member of any association. A payment made for the carrying of a passenger (excluding those connected with an air replacement service) is to be treated as a fare notwithstanding that it is made in consideration of other matters in addition to the journey and shall be treated as made for the carrying of a passenger if it gives a person the right to be carried, for one or more journeys, whether or not the right is exercised. 2013/056 Bradley Fold Travel Ltd &amp; Peter Wright the Upper Tribunal said “there is no doubt that s.1(5) gives the term “hire or reward” a wide meaning and when considered alongside the test adopted by the Divisional Court in Albert v Motor Insurers’ Bureau (supra)… the term clearly includes the manner in which Mr Wright was operating the vehicles despite the fact that he was doing his best to make a small annual loss” 2017/076 Andrew Steven Gingell v DVSA reiterated the test from Albert v Motor Insurers’ Bureau [1971] 3 W.L.R 291 “that the test of whether a vehicle was being used for “hire or reward” was whether there had been a systematic carrying of passengers for reward which went beyond the bounds of mere social kindness”.</p>

<p>Traffic commissioners should avoid strained constructions and must give effect to Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 and section 3(2), which permit the carriage of goods for hire or reward as well as in connection with the business of the operator. Section 3(3) of the 1995 Act allows a goods vehicle to be used on a road for the carriage of goods for or in connection with any trade or business carried on by the holder of the licence, other than that of carrying goods for hire or reward.</p>

<p>Where the operator only carries goods that are, or become and then remain, the operator’s own property, a restricted licence is likely to be appropriate. The Upper Tribunal has stressed the importance of looking at the purpose of the operation. For instance, the recovery of vehicles does not include the return of that vehicle, where it has been repaired. (2020/020 Parker Body Repairs Ltd by reference to sections 2 and 3 of the 1995 Act and Part V of Schedule 1, Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994) Determining the correct type of licence might be a question of fact and degree, but answering in the affirmative to the following is likely to suggest that the operation was “for or in connection with any trade or business” and for “hire or reward”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the transport of the goods part of the business?</li>
  <li>Does the operator hold, and rely on when carrying those goods, a type of insurance policy that covers carriage of goods for reward?</li>
  <li>Does the carrying result in payment, direct or indirect, which benefits the owner or user of the vehicle?</li>
</ul>

<p>As that implies, ownership of the goods is relevant to determining the type of licence required. A restricted licence is only appropriate for the carriage of the operator’s own goods (i.e. the goods are the property of the business or, in the case of a company that entity or its parent or subsidiary) and on their own account. In Parker Body Repairs, the Upper Tribunal looked at the business model and what was involved in the transport activity. Where a predominant part of the service is the transportation of goods, that is likely to fall within the definition given to hire or reward adopted by the Upper Tribunal. Where the transport is part of the operator’s wider business, such as converting or processing of the goods as opposed to simply conveying them to another place, that is likely to fall within the definition of section 3(3).</p>

<p>One of the exemptions allowed under section 2(2)(b) is the use of a vehicle for international carriage by a haulier established in another Member State. International carriage is defined by Council Regulation (EEC) No. 881/92 as being “a journey undertaken by a vehicle the point of departure and the point of arrival of which are in two different Member states, with or without transit through one or more Members States or non-members”. Under Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 any haulier from another Member State who enters GB whilst delivering an incoming international load and who complies with the conditions set out in Article 8 may take advantage of a further exemption known as ‘cabotage’. This permits an incoming vehicle, after discharging its international load, to undertake three further collections and deliveries within GB before the vehicle leaves the country, within 7 days. Those operations will only conform to the 2009 regulation if the haulier can produce clear evidence of the incoming international carriage and each of the consecutive cabotage operations. That evidence must be kept in the vehicle and made available for inspection at any roadside check. (2011/060 Nolan Transport v VOSA and SoS for Transport, 2016/008 Van Der Gaag Transport De Lier BV v DVSA)</p>

<p>Section 58 of the 1995 Act and section 81 of the 1981 Act, deem the user of a vehicle to be the driver, if s/he owns it (under hire purchase or loan etc.), or, in any other case, the person who employs/contracts the driver.  The Transport Tribunal considered the question of who is operating in 2004/377 E A Scaffolding and Systems Ltd and 2004/426 E A Contract Services Ltd and confirmed that it is generally the employer of the driver who will be the operator for the purposes of the legislation. The key in determining whether or not a person is an employee, is often to be found in the terms of employment; or if a service provider, in the contract for supply of services. Terms or a contract of employment have not been comprehensively defined in legislation or case law. The courts have adopted various tests in order to determine whether or not a relationship amounts to a relationship of employment but the general approach is to consider all the factors relevant to the issue of employment and to weigh up those factors that point towards the existence of a contract of employment and those that point away from such a contract. Carmichael and Another v National Power Plc [1999] UKHL 47 approved 3 questions posed by the judge in Readymix Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance [1968]  2 QB 497: the obligation to provide a personal service; the obligation to be controlled in relation to the manner of the task to such an extent that the worker becomes a servant; and that there is mutuality of obligations.</p>

<p>HMRC has advised that to all intents and purposes, lorry drivers cannot be self-employed when they are driving a lorry, unless they are owner/drivers with a licence to operate:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm4210">www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-status-manual/esm4210</a></li>

</ul>

<p>In the E. A. Scaffolding case the Tribunal also approved of the traffic commissioner’s reliance on a Court of Appeal decision in Interlink Express Parcels Limited v. Night Trunkers Limited &amp; Another [2001] EWCA Civ 360. In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to look at wider factors. This case turned on the identity of the operator under sections 2 and 58(2) of the Goods Act. In considering the temporary transfer of employment Arden LJ carried out a detailed review of the law. The Tribunal remarked that this was a factually complex case which could not easily be summarised. It deprecated “salami slicing” those parts of the day where one activity was carried out from those parts of the day where another, such as driving, might be undertaken. The Tribunal relied on the principle that “Interlink had the right to control the way in which the Night Trunker drivers operated their vehicles, and in all the circumstances that such drivers were properly to be regarded as temporary deemed servants of Interlink and accordingly as its servants for the purposes of section 58(2) of the 1995 Act”.</p>

<p>In determining who is operating, the issue is therefore likely to be one of control: for instance is someone entitled to give the orders as to how the work should be done? (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd and McFarlane [1946] UKHL 1, 2019/054 Bridgestep Ltd and Tom Bridge) The greater the amount of control exercised over the details of the work to be done, the more likely the relationship is to be one of employment. (Simmons v Heath Laundry Co [1910] 1 KB 543)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span>Exemptions under Schedule 3 of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995</h3>

<p>Once it has been established that an operation falls within the requirements of operator licensing, Regulation 33 of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 can then be considered as it provides for the classes of vehicles for which a licence is not required, by reference to Part I of Schedule 3. A body of case law has developed around some of these exemptions and whilst many of the cases are fact specific, some basic legal principles have been extracted. It is not possible to provide guidance in every set of circumstances. Where there is doubt as to the applicability of an exemption, a traffic commissioner can reasonably expect that informed legal advice has been sought.</p>

<p>When considering exemptions, the courts often look to the judgment of Sullivan J in Cleansing Service Group Ltd v Vehicle &amp; Operator Services Agency [2006] EWHC 662 (Admin) in which it was observed:</p>

<p>“Some system of regulating haulage operators is clearly required in order to protect public safety. It is therefore understandable that Parliament has prescribed the limits placed upon the exceptions with some care. In my view it is not a question of giving the exceptions a broad or narrow interpretation. There is no reason other than to give them their ordinary and natural meaning.”</p>

<p>The Divisional Court considered the exemptions contained in Part II of Schedule 3 as they relate to paragraph 1 of Part I, namely hauling articles for a farm required by the keeper, being either the occupier of the farm or a contractor employed to do agricultural work on the farm by the occupier of the farm. Ultimately, the appeal failed as the keeper was not employed by the occupier of the farm. The issues centred around that definition of “keeper”, by reference to Regulation 3, for which the Court posed four questions.</p>

<p>Paragraph 15 exempts: A vehicle fitted with a machine, appliance, apparatus or other contrivance which is a permanent or essentially permanent fixture, provided that the only goods carried on the vehicle are-</p>

<p>a) water, fuel, accumulators and other equipment used for the purpose of propulsion or the running of the vehicle, loose tools and loose equipment;<br>
b) to be mixed by the machine, appliance, apparatus or contrivance with other goods not carried on the vehicle on a road in order to thrash, grade, clean or chemically treat grain;<br>
c) to be mixed by the machine, appliance, apparatus or contrivance with other goods not carried on the vehicle in order to make fodder for animals; or<br>
d) mud or other matter swept up from the surface of a road by the use of the machine, appliance, apparatus or other contrivance.</p>

<p>This exemption was amended by Goods and Motor Vehicles (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2018. The prior wording formed the basis of 2009/023 Howard Collins in which the Tribunal held: “The important words are these: ‘the only other goods or burden carried are required for use in connection with the fitted equipment’. The underlining of ‘only’ and ‘required’ is ours because those words stress the two points, which need to be made in relation to this passage. First, the ‘other goods or burden’, (ie everything in addition to the equipment fitted) must be carried because it is ‘required’, in connection with the fitted equipment. Typically that would mean that the other goods or burden were carried because they were needed to make the equipment fitted work. Second, the expression ‘the only other goods or burden’ means that if the vehicle carries a mixed load, only part of which is required for use in connection with the fitted equipment, then it is not exempt”.</p>

<p>The Upper Tribunal has also considered the meaning of “contents” in an impounding case for the purposes of return under the Goods Vehicles (Enforcement Powers) Regulations 2001 and in doing so drew a distinction between “contents” and “goods” or “load”. In 2007/075 MJ Cooney the appellant had fitted a crane to a vehicle after purchase and then used the adapted truck for the business of carrying scrapped cars. Although the crane was attached to the vehicle by eight bolts and was detachable, the appeal for the return of a crane as “contents” was dismissed on the finding it was plain that the crane was not part of the “contents”.</p>

<p>Paragraph 22 exempts: A showman’s goods vehicle and any trailer drawn thereby. Regulation 3(2) defines a “showman’s goods vehicle” as having the same meaning as in section 62 of the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 and states a “showman’s goods vehicle” means a showman’s vehicle which:</p>

<p>(a) is a goods vehicle, and;<br>
(b) is permanently fitted with a living van or some other special type of body or superstructure forming part of the equipment of the show of the person in whose name the vehicle is registered under this Act’.</p>

<p>A “showman’s vehicle” is defined as a vehicle:</p>

<p>(a) registered under this Act in the name of a person following the business of a travelling showman, and<br>
(b) used solely by him for the purposes of his business and for no other purpose.</p>

<p>This exemption was considered in the case of Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency v Rowe [2017] EWHC 608 (Admin), adopting the approach in Vehicle and Operator Services Agency v Kayes [2012] EWHC 1498 (Admin), which considered whether the manner in which kiosks were transported fell within the definition. It was held in Kayes that “in order to satisfy the alternative requirement under section 62 ‘some other special type of body or superstructure forming part of the equipment of the show’ it is not necessary for such to be identifiable from the outside of the vehicle. In other words, obvious external alteration or construction is not a prerequisite, it is a question of fact and degree in each case whether the alterations and/or additions mean that the vehicle has been permanently fitted with a special type of body or superstructure.” As with other exemptions the use of the vehicle must fall exclusively within that definition to apply, in the case of Showmen membership of the Showmen’s Guild would not be sufficient evidence that the exemption applies.</p>

<p>Paragraph 27 exempts: A recovery vehicle. The legal status of “recovery vehicle” has been considered by the Upper Tribunal in 2008/011 Ansvar Holdings and 2003/286 Kenneth William Richards by reference to the definition provided in the Vehicle and Excise Registration Act 1994. “A recovery vehicle means a vehicle that is constructed or permanently adapted primarily … for the purpose of lifting, towing and transporting disabled vehicles” and goes on to say that “a vehicle is not a recovery vehicle at any time that it is used for purposes other than” [a range of jobs not relevant here]; moreover at Part 5 of Schedule 1 the regulations state “a vehicle is not a recovery vehicle if at any time the number of vehicles which it is used to recover exceeds a number specified for the purpose of this sub-paragraph, by an order made by the Secretary of State and goes on to provided that “the number specified for the purposes of paragraph 8(4) is two.</p>

<p>Paragraph 29 exempts: A vehicle proceeding to or from a station provided by the Secretary of State under section 45 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 for the purposes of an examination of that vehicle under that section provided that-</p>

<p>(a) the only load being carried is a load required for the purposes of the examination; and<br>
(b) it is being carried at the request of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Upper Tribunal in 2002/134 WC Commercials concluded that a tractor unit is a “goods vehicle” and the hauling of an unladen trailer is “carriage of goods” as discussed above.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Directions</h2>

<p>The Senior Traffic Commissioner for Great Britain issues the following Directions to traffic commissioners under section 4C(1) of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 (as amended) and by reference to section 1(2) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995. These Directions are addressed to the traffic commissioners in respect of the approach to be taken by staff acting on behalf of individual traffic commissioners and dictate the operation of delegated functions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Basis of Directions</h3>

<p>The following direction is issued under section 4C(1)(b) of the 1981 Act particularly to assist support staff and in the interests of adopting a consistent approach to decision making.</p>

<p>The statutory provisions require traffic commissioners to act under general directions of the Senior Traffic Commissioner but to only have regard to Statutory Guidance. As with any statutory power it must be exercised in accordance with public law principles. Accordingly, the power under section 4C(1)(b) must be used for the stated intention of Parliament and cannot be used to circumvent those intentions. The Senior Traffic Commissioner acknowledges that Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions cannot anticipate any legal changes and may therefore be subject to decisions of the higher courts and to subsequent legislation.</p>

<p>Members of staff are obliged to follow the Statutory Directions. Whenever the Statutory Directions, as published, are exceeded then an exception report to the Head of the Office of the Traffic Commissioner must be prepared. Where a traffic commissioner finds legal grounds not to follow the current Statutory Guidance, the Senior Traffic Commissioner directs that the individual traffic commissioner must record detailed reasons for departing from the published Statutory Guidance in writing.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal has considered the question of whether there is a general requirement as to the sufficiency of reasons (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/88.html" rel="external">R (Asha Foundation) v Millennium Commission [2003] EWCA Civ 88</a>, which adopted the same approach outlined by Sedley J  in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/1993/5.html" rel="external">R v The Universities Funding Council Ex parte The Institute of Dental Surgery [1993] EWHC Admin 5</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The giving of reasons may among other things concentrate the decision-maker’s mind on the right questions; demonstrate to the recipient that this is so; show that the issues have been conscientiously addressed and how the result has been reached or alternatively alert the recipient to a justiciable flaw in the process. On the other side of the argument, it may place an undue burden on decision makers; demand an appearance of unanimity where there is diversity; call for the articulation of sometimes inexpressible value judgments; and offer an invitation to the captious to comb the reasons for previously unsuspected grounds of challenge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Upper Tribunal has two guiding principles: a party is entitled as a matter of law to know why an adverse decision has been reached, and the decision-maker is obliged to demonstrate that they have conducted the appropriate balancing exercise and reached a decision based only on relevant matters (see Statutory Guidance and Statutory Directions on the Principles of Decision Making). The Upper Tribunal expects an adequate and intelligible statement of reasons, whether delivered in writing or in person (ex tempore).</p>

<p>It is accepted that the interactive nature of a public inquiry may require a traffic commissioner to engage with an operator in order to test the evidence and to encourage adherence to high standards and the regulatory regime. Different considerations might apply to a decision on the papers but any decision must communicate sufficient reasons to satisfy the law and any appellate body. There is no need to set out every trivial factor or combination that has no influence on the decision. There are generally three main elements to the balancing exercise. First, the relevant factors should be identified; second, each relevant factor should be assessed; and third, the analysis must indicate the weight or significance that has been attached to the relevant factors with reasons.

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Annex 1 - Withdrawal from The European Union</h2>

<p>The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, makes legal provision ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union.</p>

<p>Section 1 repeals the European Communities Act 1972 but saves EU-derived provisions (English Language version only) into domestic legislation and allows for the incorporation of direct EU legislation.</p>

<p>Direct EU legislation, so far as operative immediately before exit day, forms part of domestic law on and after exit day. “Direct EU legislation” includes any EU regulation, EU decision or EU tertiary legislation, as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day and so far as:</p>

<p>(i) it is not an exempt EU instrument (section 20(1) and Schedule 6),<br>
(ii) it is not an EU decision addressed only to a member State other than the United Kingdom, and<br>
(iii) its effect is not reproduced in an enactment to which section 2(1) applies.</p>

<p>Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 (established common rules across the European Union concerning the conditions that need to be complied with to pursue the occupation of a road transport operator, engaged in the transport of goods or passengers) and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 (established common rules on how the international road haulage market operates across the EU. It establishes a system of Community licences which can be issued by each member state to hauliers whose business is established in their country) have been retained (as “retained EU legislation”) under Section 2 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and, along with the UK legislation, help regulate the operator licensing regime. Those regulations were amended immediately following the UK’s exit from the EU, and subsequently to reflect the provisions of the UK/EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement within the meaning given in section 37 of the European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020.  The Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 make further amendments to retained Regulations (EC) No 1071/2009 and (EC) No 1072/2009, as well as to domestic legislation.</p>

<p>The legislation also saves rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures which, immediately before exit day:</p>

<p>(a) were recognised and available in domestic law by virtue of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972, and<br>
(b) were enforced, allowed and followed accordingly,</p>

<p>and allows for them to continue on and after exit day, and to then be available in domestic law (and to be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly).</p>

<p>That provision does not apply to any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies or procedures so far as they:</p>

<p>(a) form part of domestic law by virtue of section 3, or<br>
(b) arise under an EU directive (including as applied by the EEA agreement) and are not of a kind recognised by the European Court or any court or tribunal in the United Kingdom in a case decided before exit day (whether or not as an essential part of the decision in the case).</p>

<p>The principle of the supremacy of EU law does not apply to any enactment or rule of law, passed or made on or after exit day.</p>

<p>A court or tribunal is not bound by any principles laid down, or any decisions made, on or after exit day by the European Court, and cannot refer any matter to the European Court on or after exit day. A court or tribunal may have regard to anything done on or after exit day by the European Court, another EU entity or the EU so far as it is relevant to any matter before the court or tribunal.</p>

<p>The Act allows a Minister to make regulations to prevent, remedy or mitigate any failure of retained EU law to operate effectively, or any other deficiency in retained EU law, arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. In the event of any argument as to the application of EU-derived provisions made prior to the UK’s exit from the EU and in particular during the transition period to 1st January 2021, traffic commissioners should refer to the full legislation.</p>
