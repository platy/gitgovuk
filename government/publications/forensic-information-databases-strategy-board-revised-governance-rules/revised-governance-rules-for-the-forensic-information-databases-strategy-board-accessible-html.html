<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Governance Rules of the Forensic Information Databases Strategy Board</h2>

<p>a) With effect from the date of these Rules, THE FORENSIC INFORMATION DATABASES STRATEGY BOARD (referred to in this document as the “Strategy Board”) shall be governed in accordance with these Rules and any previous Rules shall cease to have effect.</p>

<p>b) Section 63AB of the Police &amp; Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), as inserted by section 24 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 requires the Home Secretary to make arrangements for a Strategy Board to oversee the operation of the National DNA Database, and to publish and lay before Parliament the Strategy Board’s Governance Rules. The FINDS Board fulfils this statutory function. The legal basis for the taking and retention of fingerprints by the police under PACE powers is in general the same as that for DNA profiles. It is considered that the role of the Strategy Board should be expanded to cover the national fingerprint oversight and these Governance Rules have been amended accordingly. It is intended to amend the legislation when an opportunity arises. The Strategy Board is an unincorporated association of its members and is accountable to the Home Secretary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Application of the Governance Rules, Definitions and Interpretation</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Strategic Aim</h2>

<p>The strategic aim of the Strategy Board, as set out in section 63AB of PACE, is to provide governance and oversight for the operation of the National DNA, and Fingerprint Databases. Police powers to take and retain fingerprints parallel their powers relating to DNA, so in practice similar issues arise in relation to both. This includes the issuing of guidance to chief officers of police on the destruction of DNA profiles; fingerprint records and custody images; the Board may also issue guidance on the making of applications to the Biometrics Commissioner under section 63G of PACE.</p>

<p>The Strategy Board’s oversight includes the application of the powers conferred under Part V of PACE for the taking, use, retention and destruction of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DNA samples and the information derived from them (the DNA profile)</li>
  <li>Fingerprints, including the role of DNA and fingerprint evidence and its contribution to:
    <ul>
      <li>National security</li>
      <li>Counter terrorism</li>
      <li>The prevention and detection of crime</li>
      <li>The investigation of an offence</li>
      <li>The conduct of a prosecution</li>
      <li>The identification of a deceased person or body part.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The strategic direction for the DNA and fingerprint databases is shaped and determined by wider policing strategies and Government policy. The Strategy Board will ensure this direction is aligned with these strategies.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Objectives</h2>

<p>The objectives of the Strategy Board shall be to implement strategy and policy to ensure:</p>

<p>a) The most effective and efficient use of the DNA and fingerprint databases to support the purposes laid down in the legislation (and no other);</p>

<p>b) That the public are aware of the governance, capability and limitations of the NDNAD and fingerprint databases so that confidence is maintained in its use across all communities.</p>

<p>c) That the future use of the NDNAD and fingerprint databases takes account of developments in science and technology and delivers improvements in efficiency and effectiveness across the Criminal Justice System.</p>

<p>d) The most proportionate, ethical and transparent use of the NDNAD, and fingerprint databases across the Criminal Justice Service.</p>

<p>e) The most ethical and effective use of international searching of UK DNA profiles and fingerprints, whilst being aware of differing legislative jurisdictions.</p>

The Home Office will be responsible for monitoring and updating these policies. The Board will be responsible for monitoring the National DNA and fingerprint databases and providing data as required in the equality and privacy policies.</p>

<p>n) Where DNA and fingerprint databases are maintained under devolved responsibilities or legislative provision for justice and policing, such as exist in Scotland and in Northern Ireland, the operational policies, procedures and management of those databases will be a devolved responsibility.</p>

<p>o) It is the responsibility of the Chair of the Strategy Board to assess requests from the police to carry out a familial search of the NDNAD, and where they consider the circumstances justify such a search, to approve the request in writing.</p>

<p>The Home Office Chief Information Officer shall be accountable for the integrity i.e. security, storage and access, of information held on the databases.</p>

<h3>

<p>The Strategy Board shall have such other powers and duties as are generally, specifically, expressly or implicitly vested in the Strategy Board under statute (including section 63AB of PACE, as inserted by section 24 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012) and these Governance Rules.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Chair</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Appointment and Removal</h3>

<p>a) The Chair will be appointed by NPCC.</p>

<p>b) The Core Members shall have the right to remove the Chair from time to time and to appoint another Chair in their place.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span> Delegation</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Delegation of Functions</h3>

<p>a) Subject to Clause 11.2, the Strategy Board may refer any aspect of its functions for discharge by any committee including one or more of its Members.</p>

<p>b) The composition of any committee of the Strategy Board shall be those committee members appointed by resolution of the Strategy Board to serve on such committee, pursuant to Clause 6.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Conditions of Delegation</h3>

<p>Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the Strategy Board may impose and, subject to any such conditions or any provision to the contrary in these Governance Rules, the proceedings of a committee consisting of two or more members shall be governed by the provisions of Clause 12 of these Governance Rules so far as they are capable of applying and subject to a quorum of two, unless the Strategy Board specifies any alternative arrangements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Reserved Powers and Delegated Powers</h3>

<p>The Strategy Board will hear and act upon risks and take decisions in respect of key strategic aspects of the National DNA and fingerprint databases. Where the issue has a high risk rating it will usually be a matter reserved for the Board. The Board as a whole will, in certain circumstances, delegate detailed work on some issues to committees or working groups. These committees will report to the Board and will bring recommendations to the Board, save for some situations where the committee will have delegated powers to make decisions and inform the Board of the decisions made. Where a committee or a working group has delegated powers, it will be made clear in Terms of Reference for that committee or working group. The Board reserves the right to periodically alter issues which are reserved and delegated but decisions in this regard will be set out within the minutes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Proceedings of the Strategy Board</h2>

<p>a) At least 14 days’ notice must be given of a meeting of the Strategy Board (or a committee of the Strategy Board); if due to urgent business a meeting must be convened at less than 14 days’ notice, any decisions taken shall only have effect with the written agreement of all core Members set out in Clause 5a above.
The Chair shall ensure that a full agenda for a meeting of the Strategy Board, together with all information a Member would reasonably require to make an informed decision about the matters to be discussed at such meeting, are sent to the Members at least 5 working days prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>b) Any Member may waive the requirements of Clause 12.3(a) in relation to any notice being given to him and if so waived, such Member will be deemed to have duly received notice.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span> Chair</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.6 </span> Decision Making</h3>

<p>a) While Board core Members represent various different stakeholder organisations and may speak at Board meetings to represent the views of that organisation, for Board decision-making the Board’s core Members are responsible collectively for all decisions made and therefore each Board core Member has equal responsibility for the collective decision making on all issues.</p>

<p>c) In the event that the core Members are unable to reach such a decision, a vote will be held. Each core member will have one vote each. The result of the vote shall be recorded in the minutes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.7 </span> Conflicts of Interest</h3>

<p>a) A Member (or any representative of that Member appointed in accordance with Clause 6) who has any personal or business interest or duty which conflicts or may conflict with the interests of the National DNA, and fingerprint databases in relation to any matter which is to be discussed at a meeting of the Strategy Board (or any committee thereof) shall disclose full details of such interest or duty to the meeting and such disclosure shall be noted in the minutes of the meeting.</p>

<p>b) A Member (or as the case may be) their representative shall not vote at a meeting of the Strategy Board (or any committee of a Strategy Board) upon any a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, a personal interest and may (at the discretion of the Chair of the meeting) be asked to absent himself from that part of the meeting where such matter is discussed.</p>

<p>c) A Member shall nevertheless be counted in the quorum present at a meeting of the Strategy Board (or any committee of the Strategy Board) in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote by virtue of Clause 12.7.b).</p>

<p>d) The provisions of Clause 12.7 may be suspended or relaxed to any extent, either generally or in respect of any particular matter, by a unanimous decision of the Members.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.8 </span> Meetings by Video and Telephone Conferencing</h3>

<p>Any Member may participate in a meeting of the Strategy Board (or a committee of the Strategy Board) by means of a conference telephone, video conferencing facility or similar communications equipment, which allows all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other. The security of such facilities should be appropriate to the material being discussed. A person so participating shall be deemed to be present in person at such meeting and shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum. Such meeting shall be deemed to take place where the largest group of those participating is assembled, or, if there is no such group, where the Chair of the meeting is located.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.9 </span> Written Resolutions</h3>

<p>a) A resolution of the Strategy Board (or a committee of the Strategy Board) in writing, signed by all the Core Members (or by such committee members as deemed appropriate by the Strategy Board), shall be as valid and effectual as if such resolution had been passed at a meeting of the Strategy Board (or a committee of the Strategy Board).</p>

<p>b) A written resolution for the purposes of Clause 12.9.a) may consist of an electronic document signed by email by each of the Core Members (or by committee members as appropriate).</p>

<p>c) Any Strategy Board or Committee member not required to sign a resolution must be consulted on its contents.</p>

<h3>

<ul>
  <li>i) the names of the Members present at the meeting;</li>
  <li>ii) the decisions made at the meeting and, the views or statement of any persons present at such meeting; and</li>
  <li>iii) where appropriate, the reasons for the decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>b) Any such minute, if purporting to be signed by the Chair of the meeting at which the proceedings were held, or by the Chair of the next succeeding meeting, is evidence of the proceedings.</p>

<p>c) Minutes of each Strategy Board meeting will be published on the Home Office website following their ratification by Board Members.</p>
