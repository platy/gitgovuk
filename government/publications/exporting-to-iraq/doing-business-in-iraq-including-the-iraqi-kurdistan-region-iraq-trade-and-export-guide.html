<p>The political and security situation remains fragile in Iraq. Despite this, commercial opportunities are huge as the country rebuilds its infrastructure and main institutions.</p>

<p>Sizeable contracts have been and continue to be signed with UK businesses robust enough and strategically placed to do business in Iraq</p>

<p>Iraq is highly dependent on oil. In 2021, this constituted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2021/02/10/Iraq-2020-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-Statement-by-the-Executive-50078" rel="external">37% of Iraq’s GDP, 84% of government revenue and 96% of exports</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>long and established trade links between the UK and Iraq</li>
  <li>growing economy</li>

  <li>immense scale of opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>Strengths of the Iraqi market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fifth largest economy in the Middle East and 51st largest in the world</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Challenges doing business in Iraq</h2>

<p>Iraq is a challenging market. It’s ranked poorly in the World Bank’s ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings" rel="external">Ease of Doing Business</a>’ listing.</p>

<p>The main issues are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>security concerns</li>
  <li>lack of transparency</li>
  <li>stifling bureaucracy</li>
  <li>ranks very low in Transparency International’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview" rel="external">Corruption Perceptions Index</a>
</li>
  <li>poor infrastructure</li>
  <li>weak banking sector</li>
  <li>difficulties in obtaining letters of credit and payment guarantees and delays in payments</li>
  <li>arbitration can take months, if not years</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Growth potential</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Economic growth</h3>
<p>Following an economic slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/12/03/pr21357-iraq-imf-staff-concludes-virtual-staff-visit#:~:text=Non%2Doil%20real%20GDP%20is,durable%20and%20more%20inclusive%20growth" rel="external">International Monetary Fund (<abbr title="International Monetary Fund">IMF</abbr>)</a> assessed that non-oil real GDP would rebound by 12% in 2021. Fiscal and current account balances were expected to improve significantly. Higher oil revenues presented the opportunity to tackle Iraq’s significant vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience, and achieve durable and more inclusive growth.</p>

<p>Huge hydrocarbon wealth is fuelling economic development across a range of sectors including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>oil and gas</li>
  <li>renewables</li>
  <li>infrastructure</li>
  <li>security</li>
  <li>healthcare</li>
</ul>

<p>Iraq’s economy is dominated by the public sector, which is over resourced and inefficient.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Gulf region</h3>

<p>The Gulf region is a gateway to Iraq for most larger companies based there. It can be an ideal location to conduct business for UK companies unable to travel to Iraq. However, Iraqis emphasise the importance of being present in Iraq to do business.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Free Trade Agreements (FTA)</h3>

<p>Iraq has <abbr title="Free Trade Agreements">FTAs</abbr> in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/iraq/" rel="external">EU-Iraq Partnership and Cooperation Agreement</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/trade-investment-framework-agreements" rel="external">United States-Iraq Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)</a></li>
  <li>The Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA)</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK and Iraq are currently negotiating a UK-Iraq Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, following the UK’s exit from the EU.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> UK and Iraq trade</h2>

<p>The UK total export of goods and services to Iraq was £450 million in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2021.</p>

<p>Total exports of UK goods to Iraq in the four quarters to the end of Q3 2021 were £343million.</p>

<p>Top UK goods exports are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>medicinal and pharmaceutical products</li>
  <li>miscellaneous electrical goods</li>
  <li>beverages</li>
  <li>electric motors (capital)</li>
  <li>general industrial machinery (capital)</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Energy</h3>
<p>Iraq’s economy in general and particularly the energy sector is heavily dependent on oil. However, since April 2021 the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-the-government-will-implement-its-policy-on-support-for-the-fossil-fuel-energy-sector-overseas">UK government no longer provides support for fossil fuel projects overseas</a>. This is part of the government’s objective to support the sector’s transition to green technology and renewable energy.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Iraq’s energy team in now focused on supporting UK businesses in the renewables, electricity grid, and gas capturing sectors.</p>

<p>The government of Iraq has set out ambitious targets to bolster its domestic energy supply capacity. Therefore, Iraq’s objective is to raise the share of clean energy to 20 to 25% by 2030, helped by a solid expansion in the country’s solar capacity.</p>

<p>Contact Director of International Trade, Iraq <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ditmeap.enquiries@fcdo.gov.uk">ditmeap.enquiries@fcdo.gov.uk</a> for more information on oil and gas opportunities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The government of Iraq has embarked on a large-scale upgrade of its infrastructure projects. There has been strong UK engagement with the Iraqi Ministry of Construction and Housing, which leads on this sector at the federal level. The government of Iraq has expressed a wish to cooperate with a number of international parties, including UK contractors, for the delivery and execution of these infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>UK companies, as part of their market access strategies, are also targeting relevant provinces at the local government level.</p>

<p>Design and construction opportunities include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>water infrastructure (including waste water)</li>
  <li>housing complexes</li>
  <li>offices</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Defence and security</h3>
<p>There is a great demand to import high quality equipment and services to Iraqi defence and security departments. Iraq has the desire to modernise – in some cases based on British best practice and expertise.</p>

<p>The main opportunities <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> Iraq is negotiating with the Government of Iraq are air traffic control for military airbases, UAV and CUAV, cyber security, heavy machinery and personnel transport vehicles, explosive ordnance disposal, detection devices, mine clearance services, and communication systems.</p>

<p>Other service exports include deep maintenance and repowering of planes’ engines and navy boats, airports and infrastructure static and mobile security, tactical and specialized training, etc.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Healthcare</h3>
<p>Iraq’s healthcare sector is valued at tens of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Iraq’s healthcare sector is growing fast after years of deterioration. However, the country still holds some unique challenges for companies looking to access the market. The Iraq pharmaceuticals market is worth between $2-3bn per year, according to the Iraqi Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>The number of international companies looking to enter Iraq’s market is increasing. To gain access to the public sector, international companies must engage through the State Company for Marketing Drugs and Medical Appliance “Kimadia” to the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>In the private sector, scientific offices and pharmaceuticals suppliers negotiate directly with international pharmaceuticals companies, in order to act as their representatives and local agents in Iraq. The country’s legal system and the strict product registration process can be difficult to navigate for companies coming into the market from outside Iraq.</p>

<p>The Government of Iraq considers its healthcare system to be modelled on that of the UK. The UK is therefore well placed to work with Iraq’s central government and local healthcare providers. Discussions between Healthcare UK and the Kurdistan Regional Government are underway.</p>

<p>Specific areas of opportunity for UK businesses are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building hospitals</li>
  <li>medical equipment and training</li>
  <li>pharmaceuticals (including generic brands)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.5 </span> Financial and professional services</h3>

<p>Iraq’s financial and professional services sector is in urgent need of reform. The commitment to move away from state owned industry and create a private sector necessitates the need for more diverse and better financial and professional services.</p>

<p>Creative finance and professional solutions to increase liquidity in the market to fund projects is a priority for the Federal Government of Iraq.</p>

<p>Opportunities for UK business include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>investment banking to meet the needs of global clients operating in Iraq across various industry sectors, as well as local financing demands</li>
  <li>budgeting reform and capacity building which will impact gold reserves and currency exchange</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.6 </span> Kurdistan Region of Iraq</h3>
<p>The Kurdistan Region of Iraq is a semi-autonomous region which presents a number of opportunities in market for different priority sectors for British companies. Most trade opportunities are currently in the private sector. <abbr title="Department for International Trade">DIT</abbr> is available to support in all sectors particularly those with the highest growth potential in the coming years, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>infrastructure</li>
  <li>healthcare</li>
  <li>food &amp; drink</li>
  <li>tech</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>renewable energy</li>
</ul>

<p>The Kurdistan Regional Government also have an ambitious plan to diversify the economy, broaden their implantation of the cabinets reform agenda, and to attract investment in sectors such as Agriculture, Tourism, and Manufacturing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Start-up considerations</h2>

<p>The Iraqi market is not for the fainthearted. It’s more suited to medium to large sized companies with the capability to succeed in a tough market. You must have a proven track record in the Middle East and north Africa region to be likely to succeed here.</p>

<p>The principle options to establish a business in Iraq are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>participate in a local Iraqi company or entity (for example, joint venture)</li>
  <li>establish a branch office</li>
  <li>appoint a trusted and well-connected commercial agent or distributor</li>
</ul>
