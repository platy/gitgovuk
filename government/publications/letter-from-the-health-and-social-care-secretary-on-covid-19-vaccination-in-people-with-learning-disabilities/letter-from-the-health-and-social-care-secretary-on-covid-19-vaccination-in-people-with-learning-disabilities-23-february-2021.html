<p>Dear Professor Lim,</p>

<p>RE: Advice on COVID-19 vaccination in people with learning disabilities from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>)</p>

<p>Thank you for your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-from-the-health-and-social-care-secretary-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-people-with-learning-disabilities/letter-from-the-jcvi-to-the-health-and-social-care-secretary-23-february-2021" class="govuk-link">letter on 23 February 2021 from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) on COVID-19 vaccination in cohort 6 of people with learning disabilities</a>. I note that your clinical view remains that those at greatest risk are people with severe and profound learning disabilities. It is very helpful, however, to have your support for a practical operational approach, proposing to invite everyone on the GP Learning Disability Register.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the further considerations of the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>. In line with your letter, I have asked the NHS to ensure that everyone on the Learning Disability Register is invited for vaccination as part of cohort 6.</p>

<p>Thank you for your ongoing advice and support for the vaccination programme and I look forward to further advice and discussions over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p>Matt Hancock</p>

<p>CC: Jonathan Van Tam (<abbr title="deputy chief medical officer">DCMO</abbr>)</p>
