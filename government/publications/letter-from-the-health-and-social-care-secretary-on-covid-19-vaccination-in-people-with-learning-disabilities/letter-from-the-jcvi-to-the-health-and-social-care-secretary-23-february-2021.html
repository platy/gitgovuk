<p>23 February 2021</p>

<p>Dear Secretary of State,</p>

<p>Re: Advice on COVID-19 vaccination in people with learning disabilities from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>)</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has been reviewing correspondence and commentary on the first phase of the programme alongside the latest evidence from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and OpenSAFELY. I wanted to update you on the latest position from <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> on learning disabilities, where there has been substantial comment and challenge since <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>’s advice was published.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has advised that all individuals with Down’s syndrome should be offered vaccination in priority group 4. <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has also advised that those with severe and profound learning disabilities, and those with learning disabilities residing in residential care, should be offered vaccine in group 6. Those with a wide range of neurological and respiratory conditions have also been advised to be vaccinated in priority group 6.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has received comments on the risk of mortality in those with learning disabilities, with correspondence citing evidence from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) and from the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) on risk of mortality in those with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>Evidence considered by the committee from QCOVID relating to wave 1 indicated that there was a very high relative risk of mortality in people with Down’s syndrome. QCOVID data indicated that the adjusted hazard ratio for those with Down’s syndrome was 32.55 (18.13–58.42), whereas the risk of those with learning disabilities not associated with Down’s syndrome was 1.36 (1.11–1.65). Given that Down’s syndrome accounts for a proportion of all diagnosed learning disabilities, any studies which do not separate out the risk in people with Down’s Syndrome from all other learning disabilities, as is seen in the reports from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, will over-estimate the risk in the wider group.</p>

<p>On review, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> agreed with its earlier conclusions from the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and LedeR reports that mortality among individuals with learning disability most likely reflected those with more severe forms of disability, including Downs’ syndrome, those at higher risk of exposure because they were in residential or nursing care, those in older age groups, and those more likely to have other underlying health conditions which place them at higher risk from COVID-19. It is expected that individuals with more severe learning disabilities are more likely to be on the GP Learning Disability Register, as suggested in the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> report. However, because of concerns about the coding of learning disability on GP systems, particularly with regard to the coding of severity of any disability, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> asked the OpenSAFELY team to look at mortality and morbidity in those with various code sets for learning disabilities on GP systems and to include data from wave 2 of the pandemic. The updated analysis confirmed high mortality and morbidity in those on the GP register, even after controlling for place of residence.</p>

<p><abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> therefore agrees with the current operational plan to use the PRIMIS specification, which identifies all of those on the GP Learning Disability Register plus those with codes for other related conditions, including cerebral palsy, to be invited for vaccination in priority group 6 (unless already in priority group 4, such as those with Down’s syndrome). The committee also recognised that some severely affected individuals would not be coded at all on GP systems, and supported the planned approach to work with local authorities to identify those in residential and nursing care, and those who required support, for example as part of assisted living in the community, and those in shared accommodation with multiple occupancy, to ensure this population could be offered vaccination.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair (COVID-19) of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation</p>
