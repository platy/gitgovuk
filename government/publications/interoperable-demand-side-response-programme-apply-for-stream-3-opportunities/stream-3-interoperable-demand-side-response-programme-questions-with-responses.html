<p>This page covers responses to Competition clarification questions received for Stream 3 of the Interoperable Demand Side Response (<abbr title="Interoperable Demand Side Response">IDSR</abbr>) Programme.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> General</h2>

<p><strong>1.1. Will the Interoperable Demand Side Response Programme Information Event session be recorded and available to listen to again?</strong></p>

<p>The event was not recorded. However, the slides can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/interoperable-demand-side-response-programme">Interoperable Demand Side Response webpage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.2. Will the How to Apply information event content be shared more broadly beyond the webinar?</strong></p>

<p>The How to Apply information event recording and slides can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flexibility-innovation">Flexibility Innovation Programme webpage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.3 What is the output of a feasibility study? Is it just a written report or does it require some development to prove the technical feasibility?</strong></p>

<p>The key deliverable of Stream 3 will be a feasibility report. All deliverables required for Stream 3 can be found in Section 2 – Competition Deliverables of the Stream 3 Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Scope</h2>

<p><strong>2.1. How does <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> envision this programme aligning with <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879, and Smart Charge Point Regulations Phase 1 (30 June) and Phase 2 - in development?</strong></p>

<p>Alignment to the principles of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879 is a requirement of the Stream 1 competition. Aspects of the Streams 2 and 3 competitions will require alignment to the principles of <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879. Please see the relevant requirements in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes for more detail on each Stream’s competition requirements.
The Smart Charge Point Regulations are part of a wider policy area, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/regulations-electric-vehicle-smart-charge-points">please refer to the regulations for further details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2.2. Are there other codes/standards that this programme will consider beyond <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879? BSC code modification P375 (‘Metering behind the Boundary Point’) is going live shortly and is accompanied by metering Code of Practise (<abbr title="Code of Practise">CoP11</abbr>) which are needed for settle distributed flexibility in the Balancing Mechanism.</strong></p>

<p>The standards in scope of the programme are <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878, <abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1879 and the Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller (<abbr title="Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller">SAPC</abbr>) smart metering specification. The programme does not require demonstration of other standards, such as <abbr title="Code of Practise">CoP</abbr> 11, or other requirements not in scope of these standards.</p>

<p>Energy smart appliances (<abbr title="Energy smart appliances">ESAs</abbr>) will also need to meet all over-arching relevant regulations (for example, product safety, radio equipment) (Streams 1 and 2). It is for <abbr title="Energy smart appliances">ESA</abbr> manufacturers to determine which standards/codes/ etc. they need to use to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>For further details on requirements for all Streams please refer to the corresponding requirements/specifications section in the relevant Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>2.3. Are we envisioning that this demand side response (<abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr>) would be implemented by Distribution Network Operators (<abbr title="Distribution Network Operators">DNO</abbr>)/ Distribution System Operators (<abbr title="Distribution System Operators">DSO</abbr>) given the focus on grid stability? If so, is there regulatory changes which are being considered to facilitate <abbr title="Distribution Network Operators">DNO</abbr> based <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr>, and or is there a particular framing expected of the projects?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Publicly Available Specification">PAS</abbr> 1878 does not cover the deployment and functional configuration of the wider <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr> environment (for example, communication between <abbr title="Demand Side Response Service Provider">DSRSP</abbr> and Transmission System Operator (TSO/DSOs), which is out of scope of this Programme.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Demand side response">DSR</abbr> systems built using the GB smart metering system technical framework (Stream 2), the connections between the <abbr title="Standalone Auxiliary Proportional Controller">SAPC</abbr>, <abbr title="Energy smart appliances">ESA</abbr>, Data Communication Company (<abbr title="Data Communication Company">DCC</abbr>) and <abbr title="Data Communication Company">DCC</abbr> User are in scope.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Eligibility</h2>

<p><strong>3.1. Is Stream 3 only eligible for small businesses because it is funded by the small business initiative?</strong></p>

<p>The Competition funding for Stream 3 will be awarded using the Small Business Research Initiative (<abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr>) approach.</p>

<p>Stream 3 is available for a business of any size, however, please refer to Section 5.1 – Competition Eligibility Criteria, point 10 - Applicant and Project Team Composition in the Competition Guidance Notes for further details regarding eligibility.</p>

<p>To note, eligibility criteria for Streams 1, 2 and 3 will vary and is available in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>3.2. Is the competition open to non-UK domiciled companies?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, however over 50% of the Project’s activities (as measured by eligible Project costs) must be conducted in the UK.</p>

<p>Please refer to Section 5 – Eligibility for Funding in the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes.</p>

<p><strong>3.3. Are collaborative applications required or just encouraged?</strong></p>

<p>This should be considered appropriately based on the needs of the application.</p>

<p>For Stream 3, please refer to Section 5 – Eligibility for Funding for further information on collaborative applications.</p>

<p>Whilst there are expectations outlined in the guidance, collaborative applications are not a mandatory requirement for any of the Competition streams.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Funding</h2>

<p><strong>4.1. What evidence needs to be submitted regarding labour costs? Would it be time sheets and rate sheets for all time spent on the project, or is anything further required?</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to Appendix 3 (Stream 3) - Completion of Cost Breakdown Form within the corresponding Competition Guidance Notes for clarity on evidence required.</p>
