<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme (<abbr title="Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme">BEVS</abbr> 2) provides funding to contribute to the cost of vaccinating badgers in the Edge Area of England with <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> vaccine from 2019 to 2023.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The scheme is closed to new applications. It will run until 28 February 2023.</p>
</div>

<p>This document provides information about how to run a scheme to vaccinate badgers. General information regarding the background of <abbr title="Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme">BEVS</abbr> 2, the application process and the resources you’ll need to commit to a vaccination project is available.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Requirements before you start a badger vaccination project</h2>

<p>Before starting a badger vaccination scheme, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-badger-vaccination-training">vaccination training</a>, depending on which activity you’ll be carrying out</li>
  <li>apply for a licence to vaccinate badgers from Natural England</li>
</ul>

<p>The Animal &amp; Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) is currently the only training provider. You will not be able to get a prescription for <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> vaccine until you are trained and licensed.</p>

<p>You will also need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have agreements in place giving you access to land where you plan to vaccinate (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BEVS@defra.gov.uk">contact the <abbr title="Tuberculosis">TB</abbr> team at <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr></a> to see a model land access agreement that has been drafted in consultation with the National Farmers’ Union)</li>
  <li>take out insurance (for example, to indemnify landowners in respect of any aspect of the vaccination project)</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be your responsibility to make sure volunteers can work on farms safely.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What is involved in a badger vaccination project</h2>

<p>It’s illegal to trap badgers for the purpose of vaccination between December 1 and April 30, so vaccination must take place between May and November.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Gathering information about badger activity in your vaccination area</h3>

<p>In advance of your scheme commencing you will need to carry out a detailed survey of the area you intend to vaccinate. The survey will identify setts and other signs of badger activity, like runs and latrines. This is usually best done during winter months, when there is less vegetation than in spring or summer.</p>

<p>You will have to conduct another survey immediately before you start vaccinating, to check whether badger activity in the area has changed since the initial survey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Pre-baiting traps</h3>

<p>You will need to lay traps close to any badger sett in your area that shows signs of badgers currently living in it.</p>

<p>You will need to pre-bait the traps daily for approximately a week before you actually trap badgers. Pre-baiting involves putting bait in your traps while keeping them locked open so animals become used to taking the bait.</p>

<p>During the week of pre-baiting you will need to monitor how much bait is being taken and consider adding a bait enhancer (like maple syrup) if badgers aren’t eating the bait.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Trapping badgers for vaccination</h3>

<p>When you are confident that the traps are being regularly visited by badgers and the bait is being taken, set the traps.</p>

<p>Set the traps in the afternoon or evening to minimise the time badgers will be trapped. Set each trap for at least 2 consecutive nights (if no animals are captured on one or both nights trapping may be extended).</p>

<p>Return to each trap early the next morning (generally within three hours of first light) to check on the animals you have caught. Badgers are a protected species, and you are responsible for the welfare of any animals you trap. On the way to checking the traps, collect some <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> vaccine, which you need to store in a fridge. Use a portable fridge to transport it to the traps.</p>

<p>Carefully record how you use the vaccine during your project, and return any that is unused.</p>

<p>Vaccination will require at least 2 people for each trap. Depending on the size of your trapping operation, you may require several teams of 2 people to make sure you can check all your traps early in the morning.</p>

<p>Plan your trap rounds to make sure that there are not too many trapped badgers to deal with on any given morning.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Releasing animals</h3>

<p>You will need to release badgers after vaccinating them unless they appear ill or injured, in which case you will need to seek veterinary assistance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>After vaccination</h3>

<p>You will have to remove all trace of your activity from the land once you have finished vaccinating including your equipment.</p>

<p>You will need to thoroughly clean and disinfect equipment between uses.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Equipment you will need</h2>

<p>For trapping you are likely to need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traps</li>
  <li>spare trigger bars and flaps</li>
  <li>holding cages</li>
  <li>carrying handles for the cages</li>
  <li>6-pronged restraining wickets to hold badgers in the traps</li>
  <li>karabiners to secure the end of a holding cage in case the badger has to be removed from site to be seen by a vet</li>
  <li>curved scissors to remove hair in order to mark badgers which have been vaccinated</li>
  <li>stock marker spray to additionally mark badgers which have been vaccinated</li>
  <li>bait (generally animal grade peanuts)</li>
  <li>a non-meat bait enhancer (like golden syrup, maple syrup, molasses)</li>
  <li>containers to carry bait and bait enhancer</li>
</ul>

<p>To store and administer vaccine you are likely to need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fridge that can maintain a temperature between 2°C and 8°C</li>
  <li>a portable fridge with mains and car power cables</li>
  <li>a thermometer to check temperature</li>
  <li>Leur Lok syringes</li>
  <li>needles</li>
  <li>a Peli case or similar secure container to transport reconstituted vaccine to the sett</li>
  <li>a locally approved sharps disposal bin for disposal of used vaccine vials/ampoules and needles</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Reporting requirements</h2>

<p>Recipients of <abbr title="Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme">BEVS</abbr> 2 funding must comply with monitoring and reporting requirements set out in the grant agreement. You will need to submit an annual report covering the previous calendar year, reflecting on the effect of the activities initiated by the grant funding, no later than 1 April each year.</p>

<p>You also need to complete a VF3 vaccination licence return form whenever you set traps to vaccinate badgers.</p>

<p>You will need to keep other records during a vaccination project to meet the legal requirements of the Veterinary Medicines Regulations. The forms listed below are available to help you fulfil legal requirements for data recording. They are available to <abbr title="Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme">BEVS</abbr> 2 grant recipients on request from <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VF1 - sett survey form</li>
  <li>VF2 - sett check form, describing details of the sett targeted and the traps used</li>
  <li>VF4 - badger carcass submission form</li>
  <li>VF5 – <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> order form</li>
  <li>VF6 – <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> vaccine/diluent tracking form</li>
  <li>VF7 - <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine">BCG</abbr> vaccine/diluent disposal form</li>
  <li>VF8 - refrigerator temperature record chart</li>
  <li>VF9 - portable refrigerator temperature record chart</li>
</ul>

<p>However, unlike the VF3 form (which is compulsory) lay vaccinators are free to record this information in other ways.</p>

<p>You will also need to keep a copy of the prescription for vaccine that you obtained from a vet.</p>

<p>These forms must be made available for inspection on request. They will be audited and should normally be kept for 5 years.</p>
