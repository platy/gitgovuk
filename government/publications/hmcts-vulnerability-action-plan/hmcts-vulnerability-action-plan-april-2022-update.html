<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>Coming to court can be a daunting experience for anyone, but it can be an even bigger challenge for the most vulnerable in our society. The HMCTS Vulnerability Action Plan supports our aim to make courts and tribunals accessible for all. It sets out the work we’re doing to ensure our vulnerable users are not disadvantaged or discriminated against, as we deliver services now, during COVID-19 recovery and in the future.</p>

<p>Our commitment is to ensure that we’re listening to our partners who support vulnerable groups, as well as vulnerable people themselves, and adapting and improving our services to meet their needs. We’re also working in partnership with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and other government departments to make sure we provide the right level of support, so that our vulnerable users can always access the justice system safely and with confidence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Background</h2>

<p>During COVID-19, we changed the way courts and tribunals worked so they could continue to run safely. Our first <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmcts-vulnerability-action-plan/hmcts-vulnerability-action-plan">Vulnerability Action Plan</a> in July 2020 set out how we supported vulnerable users so that they could continue to access the justice system and engage with new ways of working. An update was <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmcts-vulnerability-action-plan/hmcts-vulnerability-action-plan-october-update">published in October 2021</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve now developed and extended our Vulnerability Action Plan to include the work we’re doing as part of the HMCTS reform programme to design future accessible services.</p>

<p>We continue to focus on three priority areas so vulnerable users can access the justice system safely and with confidence. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing the right support vulnerable users need to access and participate in court and tribunal services and signposting to other sources of information and support when vulnerable users need it</li>
  <li>gathering and collating evidence and using it to identify impacts of changes on vulnerable users</li>
  <li>making services accessible for vulnerable users</li>
</ul>

<p>Our Vulnerability Action Plan is an active plan and we’ll continue to make sure our vulnerable users can access our services. We’ll do this through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ongoing engagement with vulnerable users and those who support vulnerable groups</li>
  <li>considering the impact of legislative change such as the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. the Victims Bill, and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill</li>
  <li>implementing new cross government strategies such as the national disability strategy, the national strategy for autistic children, young people and adults, and the MoJ neurodiversity action plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What we’ve done since our last update</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Providing the right support vulnerable users need to access and participate in court and tribunal services and signposting when vulnerable users need it</h3>

<h4>Cross Jurisdictional</h4>
<ul>
  <li>introduced the new Appointed Intermediary Service in April 2022 which sets out the quality and standards required of intermediaries. Intermediaries help users who have communication needs and provide professional support so they can participate in court and tribunal proceedings.</li>
  <li>awarded the digital support service contract to ‘We Are Digital’, one of the UK’s leading digital skills and inclusion providers. We expect to be delivering full service and geographical coverage from May 2022 for our reformed services. Users who face digital exclusion will receive the support required to access HMCTS services and are often those that are most vulnerable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Crime</h4>
<ul>
  <li>introduced a YouTube animation for jurors in February 2022. The link is sent after jury service has ended and provides jurors with practical advice and signposting to emotional support if they need it. This can help support those jurors that feel vulnerable and need emotional support.</li>
  <li>introduced a training video for staff in January 2022, which explains how to deal with requests for any additional support made by jurors with disabilities so they can fully participate in jury service. These are called reasonable adjustments.</li>
  <li>introduced a learning package in spring 2022 to help our staff provide effective support for victims and witnesses. This includes the importance of providing a service for victims and witnesses that meets their individual needs and will help them give their best evidence.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Civil, Family and Tribunals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>carried out service user testing to simplify the Employment Tribunals claim form. The form asks users if they would be able to take part in a remote hearing to allow the judge to agree the right type of hearing for the parties in the case. This can help support our vulnerable users in the way that best meets their needs.</li>
  <li>when Social Security and Child Support (SSCS) hearings are recorded it’s used as ‘the record of proceedings’.&nbsp;For digital cases the user can request and access this online but where the user is not able to access the recording online they can request it in an alternative format.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Gathering and collating evidence and using it to identify impacts of changes on vulnerable users</h3>

<h4>Cross Jurisdictional</h4>
<ul>
  <li>published the findings from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmcts-remote-hearing-evaluation">the evaluation of remote hearings report</a>, which recommended more support for vulnerable users and increasing awareness of the support available to public users when attending a remote hearing. They also recommended the development and promotion of training and guidance for staff on the management of interpreters and intermediaries in remote hearings. The findings will help us address issues, such as communication and access to support for all our users including those that are vulnerable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of user feedback from remote hearings report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Doesn’t really feel the same stress or anticipations as a court, takes out a lot of negatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">They don’t have to travel to the hearing so can avoid public transport.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Financially and mentally, it removes a lot of stress.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Crime</h4>
<ul>
  <li>evaluated the enforcement team training on identifying and responding to the needs of vulnerable people. This will inform how we develop the training for other HMCTS staff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Making services accessible for vulnerable users</h3>

<h4>Cross jurisdictional</h4>
<ul>
  <li>developed a learning product and improved guidance for our staff to support them in considering our public sector equality duty (PSED) when introducing change to ensure service users are not disadvantaged or discriminated against.</li>
  <li>published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-join-a-cloud-video-platform-cvp-hearing/how-to-join-cloud-video-platform-cvp-for-a-video-hearing">guidance on GOV.UK</a> to help people understand what to expect in a Cloud Video Platform (CVP) hearing and give participants a chance to familiarise themselves with the process before the hearing. There is also a support number which users can call.</li>
  <li>in partnership with the University of Oxford, Oxford Brookes University and the Judiciary, we’ve produced a set of films to help users of the justice system access and participate in online hearings and improve understanding of court processes. The films are available with subtitles in six languages along with a British Sign Language version of each.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Crime</h4>
<ul>
  <li>expanded the scheme for vulnerable victims and witnesses to give pre-recorded evidence at all Crown Courts. Victims or witnesses can give evidence well in advance of a trial - so they no longer have to physically attend court on the hearing day.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Civil, Family and Tribunals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>improved the Family Law Act injunction application form and introduced a witness statement template for applicants. The form provides important information, about keeping contact details confidential, a specific instruction to avoid entering details of a refuge on the application form and details of special measures that may be available.</li>
  <li>improved our divorce application guidance, using easier to understand language to reduce the number of rejected cases due to incorrect completion. We’ve updated signposting on GOV.UK and the digital application form provides contact information if further help or support is needed. New laws which came into effect in April 2022 streamline the divorce process further and allow couples to divorce without assigning blame, which aims to reduce conflict and disputed cases.</li>
  <li>introduced remote hearings in Special Educational Needs (SEN) tribunals, which has meant that parties, and particularly parents of children with SEN or a young person with SEN, no longer have to travel to the hearing. This also means that parents no longer need to bring a carer with them to look after the child if the child is not in the hearing itself.</li>
  <li>delivered 200 protective screens to our Family Courts, which means that victims of domestic abuse can avoid seeing the accused perpetrator during the court hearing.</li>
  <li>introduced a freephone number for parties joining Social Security and Child Support CVP hearings via telephone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Looking to the future</h2>

<p>We’ll continue to review any changes we make to understand what the impacts are on vulnerable users.</p>

<p>We plan to consider how we evaluate the experience of victims, witnesses and defendants – particularly those deemed vulnerable and from ethnic minority backgrounds — in criminal courts’</p>

<p>We’ll keep talking with external stakeholders and partners and through our Public User Engagement Groups to get feedback and understand issues.</p>

<p>If we find negative impacts on vulnerable people using our services, we’ll continue to take steps to fix them and include them in our Vulnerability Action Plan.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to publish our plan on GOV.UK.</p>
