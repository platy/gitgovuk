<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing grant funding associated with initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>monitoring the public cost of student loans accessed by trainees</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance refers to <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> funding for the academic year 2021 to 2022. For the academic year 2020 to 2021, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2020-to-2021">Funding: initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>), academic year 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Postgraduate bursaries and scholarships</h2>

<p>Bursaries and scholarships are available to trainees on tuition fee-based teacher training courses in England that lead to the award of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status</a> (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Receiving a bursary or scholarship depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest relevant academic award</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> subject</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainees are only eligible for a bursary or scholarship if they’re entitled to support under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies">student finance criteria</a>. Trainees from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-uk-guidance-for-eu-students">Studying in the UK: guidance for EU students</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Applicants may be eligible for a bursary if they have a  1st, 2.1 or 2.2, or if they hold Master’s or PhD.</p>

<p>We are also offering scholarships of £26,000 in chemistry, computing, maths and physics. Scholarships also come with a package of additional benefits from the appropriate professional body.</p>

<p>Each of the professional bodies that offer scholarships sets the award criteria. Scholarship applicants should apply to the relevant professional body.
