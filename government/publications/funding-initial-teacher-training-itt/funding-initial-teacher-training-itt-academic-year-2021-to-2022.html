<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing grant funding associated with initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>monitoring the public cost of student loans accessed by trainees</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance refers to <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> funding for the academic year 2021 to 2022. For the academic year 2020 to 2021, read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-initial-teacher-training-itt-academic-year-2020-to-2021">Funding: initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>), academic year 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Postgraduate bursaries and scholarships</h2>

<p>Bursaries and scholarships are available to trainees on tuition fee-based teacher training courses in England that lead to the award of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status</a> (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Receiving a bursary or scholarship depends on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>highest relevant academic award</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> subject</li>
</ul>

<p>Trainees are only eligible for a bursary or scholarship if theyâre entitled to support under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies">student finance criteria</a>. Trainees from the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland should read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/studying-in-the-uk-guidance-for-eu-students">Studying in the UK: guidance for EU students</a>.</p>

<p>Applicants with a degree from outside the UK can contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/contact" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a> or their chosen training provider for more advice.</p>

<p>For 2021 to 2022, we are offering bursaries of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£24,000 in chemistry, computing, maths and physics</li>
  <li>Â£10,000 in languages and classics</li>
  <li>Â£7,000 in biology</li>
</ul>

<p>Applicants may be eligible for a bursary if they have a  1st, 2.1 or 2.2, or if they hold Masterâs or PhD.</p>

<p>We are also offering scholarships of Â£26,000 in chemistry, computing, maths and physics. Scholarships also come with a package of additional benefits from the appropriate professional body.</p>

<p>Each of the professional bodies that offer scholarships sets the award criteria. Scholarship applicants should apply to the relevant professional body. For details, go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-my-teacher-training/bursaries-and-scholarships-for-teacher-training" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a>.</p>

<h2>
