<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The Department for Education is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing grant funding associated with initial teacher training (<abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>monitoring the public cost of student loans accessed by trainees</li>
</ul>

<p>For the 2020 to 2021 academic year we’ll manage recruitment in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/requesting-initial-teacher-training-places-2020-to-2021">Initial teacher training allocations methodology: 2020 to 2021</a>.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This guidance refers to ITT funding for the academic year 2020 to 2021. For the academic year 2019 to 2020, read Funding: initial teacher training (ITT), academic year 2019 to 2020.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Tuition fee routes</h2>

<p>Bursaries and scholarships are available to trainees on tuition fee-based teacher training courses in England that lead to the award of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/qualified-teacher-status-qts">qualified teacher status</a> (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Availability is dependent on the highest relevant academic award and the <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> subject. To receive a bursary or scholarship, trainees must be entitled to support under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/new-fulltime-students">Student Finance England</a> criteria as either a home or EU student.</p>

<p>Applicants with a degree from outside the UK can contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/contact" rel="external">Get into Teaching</a> for guidance on equivalent qualifications. They can also consult their chosen training provider as the provider determines eligibility for a bursary.</p>

<p>Graduates with a 2:1 and above can apply for a scholarship with the appropriate professional body. As well as the financial award, scholars will receive a package of additional benefits provided by the professional bodies.</p>

<p>Trainees with a 2:2 may be awarded a scholarship in exceptional circumstances, if they have significant relevant experience.</p>

<p>Trainees awarded a scholarship cannot also receive a bursary. Trainees who are not awarded a scholarship may be eligible for a bursary, if they meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Early-career payments: chemistry, languages, mathematics and physics</h3>

<p>Chemistry, languages, mathematics and physics trainees will receive 3 additional early-career payments of £2,000 each (or £3,000 each if teaching in specified areas of England) in their second, third and fourth year of teaching, if they have taught in a state-funded school in England since completing their teacher training course. These amounts are after tax, so teachers will receive the full amount as stated.</p>

<p>For more information, please read the early-career payments guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Primary with mathematics</h3>

<p>Primary with mathematics trainees with at least a B at A level in mathematics (or equivalent qualification or subject knowledge) will be eligible for a bursary of £6,000.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Undergraduate bursary</h3>

<p>A training bursary for final year undergraduates of £9,000 is available for trainees on courses in secondary mathematics and physics that lead to qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>). The bursary is available to undergraduate trainees who enrol on a <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> course starting in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, and is payable in the final year of their course.</p>

<p>The same £9,000 training bursary is available to trainees on an opt-in secondary undergraduate mathematics, physics, computing or languages course that leads to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>. The bursary is available to undergraduate trainees who enrol on a <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> course in the 2020 to 2021 academic year, and is payable in the final year of their course.</p>

<p>For both of these courses, trainees who are on a 4 year undergraduate course, that leads to the award of <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> and that also leads to the award of a Master’s degree, receive a £9,000 bursary in both the third and fourth years of their course.</p>

<p>For further information on postgraduate and undergraduate bursaries, please read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-bursary-funding-manual">initial teacher training bursary: funding manual</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Troops to Teachers undergraduate bursary</h3>

<p>A training bursary worth £40,000 is available for undergraduate veterans who have left full time employment from the British Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Navy no more than 5 years before the start of their course.</p>

<p>The bursary will be provided in equal monthly instalments in each of the final two years of the course, with £20,000 payable in each year. You are advised to confirm the actual payment schedule with your <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> provider.</p>

<p>The bursary is available to undergraduate trainees who enrol on an eligible <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> course that leads to <abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr> in secondary biology, physics, chemistry, computing, mathematics or languages, beginning in the 2020 to 2021 academic year.</p>

<p>The initial teacher training bursary guide for academic year 2020 to 2021 will be published in due course.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>School Direct salaried route</h2>

<p>On the School Direct (salaried) training route the full costs of training and the trainee’s salary need to be met by the school partnership where the training is taking place. We provide grants to School Direct lead schools to contribute to these costs. Amounts vary on a regional basis.</p>

<p>The definitions for inner London, outer London and London fringe are in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-direct-salaried-funding-manual">Annex B of the School Direct (salaried): funding manual</a>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>Subject knowledge enhancement (<abbr title="subject knowledge enhancement">SKE</abbr>)</h2>

<p>We are committed to the use of <abbr title="subject knowledge enhancement">SKE</abbr> to support <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> recruitment in priority and EBacc subjects. We expect <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> providers and lead schools offering these subjects to also consider offering <abbr title="subject knowledge enhancement">SKE</abbr> to eligible applicants.</p>

<p><abbr title="subject knowledge enhancement">SKE</abbr> courses are fully funded and delivered by universities, schools and private organisations across England.

<span class="number">6. </span>Early Years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> allocates and funds early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> places each academic year. Early years <abbr title="initial teacher training">ITT</abbr> leads to the award of early years teacher status (<abbr title="early years teacher status">EYTS</abbr>).</p>

<p>We provide training bursaries and training grants to attract high-quality graduates to become early years teachers. This funding can only be used in delivering training programmes to support trainees in meeting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-teachers-standards">the early years teachers’ standards</a>. The training grant includes the costs of assessment against these standards.</p>
