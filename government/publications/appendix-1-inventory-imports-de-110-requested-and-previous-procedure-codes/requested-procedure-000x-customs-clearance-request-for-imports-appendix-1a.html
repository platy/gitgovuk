<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Codes in this appendix may only be used where no other Procedure Code specified in CDS Declaration Instructions for Imports collection applies.</p>

<p>The Procedure Codes listed in this appendix are not valid for use on a C21i <abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records Notification of Presentation">EIDR NOP</abbr>. Procedure Codes from the CDS Declaration Instructions for Imports collection must be used instead.</p>

<p>The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main CDS Customs Clearance Request completion instructions for imports</p>

<p>This Appendix only contains any unique completion notes for each <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> and C21i 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> declaration or C21i <abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr> should be completed.</p>

<p>Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11.</p>

<p>These completion notes are supplemented by the <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">0002: </span> Release to Free Circulation and/or Home Use</h2>

<p>These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-trade-tariff-cds-volume-3-customs-clearance-request-completion-guide-inventory-imports">CDS <abbr title="Bulk Import Reduced Data Set">BIRDS</abbr> Declarations and Customs Clearance Request completion instructions for inventory imports</a>. These are additional notes on specific data elements in relation to this Procedure Code and do not constitute full guidance on how the Customs Clearance Request (<abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>) should be completed.</p>

<h3>Description of Procedure:</h3>

<p>The use of this Procedure Code is a declaration that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.</p>

<p>Customs Clearance Request (<abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>) to release goods from customs control to free circulation and/or home use on payment of customs duty and other charges, as applicable. It may only be used for goods where a written customs declaration is not required or an oral declaration/declaration by any other act has been made.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code may be used to release goods to free circulation and/or home use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Upon the completion of a manual tax line to declare any revenue to be paid or secured and any charges being collected satisfactorily, as applicable (Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</li>
  <li>Where goods may be declared using an oral declaration or declaration by any other act and</li>
  <li>Where a written customs declaration is not required.</li>
</ul>

<p>The manual calculations made in conjunction with any charges to be paid or secured must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 (Tax Base), 4/6 (Payable Tax Amount) and 4/7 (Total Taxes). A Method of Payment (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr>) code must be declared for each Tax Type in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8.</p>

<p><abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 6/14 is only required where a document, licence or admissibility certificate has to be endorsed using the C21i.
These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the Customs Clearance Request (<abbr title="Customs Clearance Request">CCR</abbr>) (<abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/11).</p>

<h3>Restrictions:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code should not be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For any goods claiming a duty relief</li>
  <li>For any goods being re-imported</li>
  <li>For any goods being temporarily imported or admitted to the UK</li>
  <li>Where a written customs declaration is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Release for free circulation may be dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 1/10 Procedure Code may only be used where no other Procedure Code specified in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-trade-tariff-volume-3-for-cds--2">CDS Declaration Instructions for Imports collection</a> applies.</p>

<p>This Procedure Code cannot be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (<abbr title="Simplified Declaration Procedure">SDP</abbr>) or Entry in Declarants Records (<abbr title="Entry in Declarantâs Records">EIDR</abbr>).</p>

It may only be used where a written customs declaration is not required or an oral declaration/declaration by any other act has been made.</p>

<h3>Conditions for Use:</h3>

<p>This Procedure Code may be used to release re-imported goods with Union Status to free circulation and/or home use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where goods were in free circulation (Union Status) and/or home use at the time of export</li>
  <li>Where a claim to full or partial relief from customs duties and/or other charges is made as a result of re-importation under Returned Goods Relief (<abbr title="Returned Goods Relief">RGR</abbr>) or <abbr title="Admission Temporaire or Temporary Admission">ATA</abbr>/<abbr title="Carnet de Passages en Douane">CPD</abbr> Carnet arrangements;</li>
  <li>Where claims to partial relief are made, upon the completion of a manual tax line to declare any revenue to be paid or secured and any charges being collected satisfactorily, as applicable (Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (<abbr title="Union Customs Code">UCC</abbr>)).</li>

</ul>

<p>The manual calculations made in conjunction with any charges to be paid or secured must be declared in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/4 (Tax Base), 4/6 (Payable Tax Amount) and 4/7 (Total Taxes). A Method of Payment (<abbr title="Method of Payment">MOP</abbr>) code must be declared for each Tax Type in <abbr title="Data Element">DE</abbr> 4/8.</p>
