<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The small scheme appraisal toolkit has been developed to provide a proportionate method to monetise the impacts of small highway and bus improvement schemes. The toolkit should only be used for schemes where there is likely to be limited routing or variable demand impacts. Where there are expected to be sizeable routing and/or demand impacts it is recommended that an appropriate model together with TUBA are used to assess the scheme impacts in line with the guidance in TAG.</p>

<p>The toolkit can provide an estimate of the Present Value of Benefits (PVB), Present Value of Costs (PVC) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of a scheme based on the forecast impacts in the scheme opening year. The impacts of the scheme, in terms of changes to journey times and journey distances, and level of user demand will need to be estimated outside the toolkit using observed and/or modelled demand information and outputs from assessment models, bespoke calculations, etc. These can then be entered into the toolkit where they will be monetised and converted to appraisal period benefits.</p>

<p>Depending on the scheme type and the inputs provided, the toolkit will produce a monetised assessment of the following impacts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highway journey time</li>
  <li>Highway vehicle operating cost</li>
  <li>Bus journey time</li>
  <li>Bus journey quality</li>
  <li>Noise</li>
  <li>Accidents</li>
  <li>Air quality</li>
  <li>Greenhouse Gases</li>
  <li>Indirect tax</li>
</ul>

<p>Scheme costs can be included in the toolkit, and the PVC will be calculated for the scheme and used in a BCR calculation.</p>

<h2>What schemes can the toolkit be used for?</h2>

<p>The toolkit can be used to support the assessment of the following types of schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small highway schemes: where the scheme impact has been assessed using operational assessment tools (e.g.  Junctions 9, LinSig, etc.) or models with limited spatial coverage.</li>
  <li>Small bus infrastructure schemes: where a simple assessment has been made of the impact on bus journey times (noting the toolkit captures the resultant impact on highway users at a high level).</li>
  <li>Schemes to improve the environment for bus travellers (e.g. new bus shelters, CCTV, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schemes with multiple elements</h2>

<p>Where the scheme is made up of multiple discrete elements which have been assessed separately, then multiple versions of the toolkit will need to be run (noting there will need to be aggregation of benefits/costs across scheme elements to obtain the total BCR); however if multiple scheme impacts are assessed in a single model these can be assessed in a single version of the toolkit.</p>

<h2>Inputs</h2>

<p>The toolkit can be used to monetise the impacts of a scheme, however the impact of the scheme on demand, journey times and travel distance will need to be estimated outside of the toolkit then input on the proforma sheets. The inputs to the toolkit can be based on modelled outputs (including operational assessment models and simple spreadsheet models) or observed data.</p>

<p>To estimate scheme benefits, the toolkit requires inputs for both the Do-Minimum and Do-Something scenarios of demand, and depending on the scheme type, inputs may also include total travel time / total delay, total travel distance and changes to bus infrastructure. All inputs are required for the scheme opening year, or a proxy year that is as close to the scheme opening year as possible (preferably within 3 years, or if unavailable, adjusted to reflect the opening year).</p>

<p>All inputs to the sheets I- Impacts proforma and I- Cost proforma should be provided where possible, noting that for some schemes/modelling platforms it will not be possible to obtain all inputs. Within the proforma users should complete all yellow cells (where possible) and should select from the dropdown in the green cells. User instructions/notes are shown in green text within the proformas.</p>

<p>The table below details the proforma inputs and some guidance notes.</p>
