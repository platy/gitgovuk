<h2>Project objectives</h2>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> pays some of its Tax Credit and Child Benefit customers via Post Office Card Accounts (<abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr>). These accounts are provided to government by Post Office Ltd through a contract held by Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>). The existing contract comes to an end on 30 November 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> (and the other government departments that have been using <abbr title="Post Office Card Accounts">POCAs</abbr>) have been contacting customers to tell them of the forthcoming change and the need to therefore move their payments into other bank accounts.</p>

<p>Attempts to contact customers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>letter: between <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> and <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, a <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> customer will have received up to 12 hard copy pieces of correspondence between Oct 2019 and December 2021</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>press and digital: there has already been substantial media coverage. Media activity will continue in early 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GOV.UK: amended the GOV.UK pages to make it clear what action customers need to take</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SMS/Text comms: SMS awareness campaign started mid 2021 and may continue. Outbound telephony has produced a good level of conversion - <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will continue with this method of attempted communication until <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> cessation on 5 April 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External Affairs/stakeholders: <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> have engaged with stakeholders who can help us reach this audience, using their own channels - we will provide Q&amp;A’s and other assets for their use, which will include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>entries in Top 100 and MP digest</li>
      <li>informing Tax Credit Consultation Forum and ISA forums</li>
      <li>
<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> local authority newsletter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has agreed that it will cease to have monies paid into <abbr title="Post Office Card Accounts">POCAs</abbr> with effect from 6 April 2022 (this coincides with the Tax Credit renewal timings).</p>

<h2>Customer groups affected</h2>

<p>The customer groups affected by the scheme are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>5,600 individual child benefit recipients</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2,000 individual tax credit recipients</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What customers will need to do</h2>

<h3>What customers need to do as a result of the change</h3>

<p>Customers will need to notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of an alternative bank account in which to receive their tax credit and child benefit.</p>

<h3>How customers will access this service.</h3>

<p>Alternative account details can be provided by phone, by letter, by completing and returning a form already sent, or by accessing the Personal Tax Account.</p>

<h3>When customers need to do this</h3>

<p>Customers must notify <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> of an alternative bank account by the 5 April 2022. In the most exceptional circumstances where customers cannot obtain a bank account, an alternative method of payment will be considered.</p>

<h2>Assessing the impact</h2>

<p>We assessed the equality impacts on all the protected characteristic groups in line with the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty; and section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gender reassignment</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>age</li>
  <li>Religion or belief</li>
  <li>pregnancy and maternity</li>
  <li>marriage and civil partnership</li>
  <li>people with or without dependents</li>
  <li>political opinion (for Northern Ireland only)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest any specific impacts on those customers within any of the protected characteristic groups (listed above).</p>

<h3>Mitigations applicable to all customers</h3>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> will telephone all remaining <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> customers (for which we hold telephone numbers) and remind them of the need to convert by 5 April 2022.</p>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> have consulted with representative bodies though the Tax Credits Consultation Forum and multiple other bodies, eg <a class="govuk-link" href="http://moneyhelper.org.uk/" rel="external">moneyhelper.org.uk</a>. These parties have agreed to publicise the change on the various websites they own.</p>

<p>If it is noted through customer liaison that a customer is experiencing extraordinary challenges in opening a bank account that customer (or their representatives) will be directed to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Extra Support Team for bespoke help (which may include voucher payment).</p>

<h3>Racial groups</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> does not hold protected characteristics information on <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> customers other than sex. We do not anticipate any specific impacts on the stated ‘protected characteristics’ noted in this document.  However, we recognise that some customers encounter language challenges.</p>

<h4>Proposed mitigation</h4>

<p>To mitigate language issues <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> staff are able to access interpretative resources as part of ‘business as usual’.</p>

<p>For customers where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds details of an authorised ‘other’ (appointee) who acts on the customers behalf, contact will be directed to that individual (letters).</p>

<h3>Disabled</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p>Some customers will require additional support to understand what they need to do.</p>

<h4>Proposed mitigation</h4>

<p>Customers or their representative who required additional support will be directed to <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>’s Extra Support Team.
For customers where <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> holds details of an authorised ‘other’ (appointee) who acts on the customers behalf, contact will be directed to that individual (letters).</p>

<h3>Sex</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p>A greater proportion of women than men are the recipients of Child Benefit payments. This is a conscious decision and relates to legislative/regulatory direction.</p>

<p>In consequence it should be noted that there is a conscious, positive bias to pay the female/maternal role in any partnership applying for Child Benefit payments.</p>

<p>However, the removal of <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> as a payment receipt platform will not discriminate based on sex as all <abbr title="Post Office Card Account">POCA</abbr> accounts are being withdrawn.</p>

<h3>People who use different languages (including Welsh language and British Sign Language)</h3>

<h4>Impact on customers</h4>

<p>Some.</p>

<h4>Proposed mitigation</h4>

<p>To mitigate language issues <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> staff are able to access interpretative resources as part of ‘business as usual’.</p>

<p>All outgoing <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> communications to identified Welsh language customers is translated and issued (including bilingual options where required).</p>

<h3>Opportunities to promote equalities</h3>

<p>We have considered opportunities to promote equalities and good relations between people in each of the protected characteristic groups and those outside of that group.</p>

<p>None have been identified.</p>

<p>A full equality impact assessment is not recommended.</p>
