<p><strong>This advice is important to you. Please read it immediately. You must act quickly in deciding whether to appeal.</strong></p>

<h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before you make your appeal, you should enter into discussions with the local planning authority (LPA). We encourage you to continue these discussions, during the appeal. This will help to narrow the areas in dispute.</p>

<p>You should make your appeal only when all else has failed.</p>

<h3>System Availability</h3>

<p>Our online facilities will usually be available 24 hours a day. We will sometimes need to take the system out of service for a while to implement upgrades. Wherever possible, we will do this outside of usual office hours.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

<p>Before you start, you should ensure that you have the following system requirements -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adobe Acrobat (Version 9 or higher recommended);</li>
  <li>an internet browser (Internet Explorer/Chrome/Firefox recommended);</li>
  <li>an email account.</li>
</ul>

  <li>access any of your appeals or representations which you are still working on via the ‘Awaiting submissions’ facility. Please note that any appeals or representations which are still awaiting submission after 180 days will be automatically deleted;</li>
  <li>view submitted representations through ‘My representations’. This will include any representations you have submitted for your own case(s) and any representations which you may have submitted for other cases which you are interested in (for example, as an interested party). These will not be editable as they have already been submitted to us. You will have been emailed a PDF version of the form upon submission;</li>
  <li>watch any cases which are of interest to you. Once you have found a case which you want to follow, you can click the ‘Watch case’ button on the Case Summary screen and the case will then be added to your ‘Watched cases’ list. If at any time you want to remove the case from your list, simply click the ‘Stop watching’ button on the Case Summary screen or click the red ‘x’ button on your homepage and the case will be removed from your list.</li>

<h2>Making your appeal</h2>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>

<p>We must receive your enforcement appeal <strong>before</strong> the date on which the notice takes effect. This date should be shown on the enforcement notice and should be at least 28 days from the date of issue of the enforcement notice which should also be shown on the notice. You should not wait until the last few days.
A local planning authority has discretion on whether to issue an enforcement notice. A local planning authority will issue an enforcement notice because it considers that what is being done or has been done is a breach of planning control because it is development that is not authorised by a planning permission or is a breach of condition(s) attached to a planning permission.</p>

<p>Further guidance on the circumstances in which a local planning authority may consider issuing an enforcement notice is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Before you decide to appeal, please consider carefully the LPA’s reasons for serving the enforcement notice on you. These are set out on the enforcement notice.</p>

<h3>Who can appeal?</h3>

<p>An appeal may be made by:</p>

<p>(i) a person who has a legal interest in the land when the appeal is made (irrespective of his/her standing when the notice was served); or</p>

<p>(ii) a relevant occupier in occupation of the land both when the notice was served and when the appeal is made.</p>

<p>The terms “a person” and “a relevant occupier” includes a limited company or unincorporated body. If this is the case the appeal must be made by the company. A director or shareholder does not have the right of appeal on the Company’s behalf. Or in the case of an unincorporated body, their authorised representative. 
Interest in this context has a special significance. It means either a legal or equitable interest in the land. It includes owners, lessees, some tenants and Official Receivers. Mortgagees or other lenders also have an interest in the land (as security for the loan they have advanced to the borrower).</p>

<p>A “relevant occupier” means a person who:</p>

<p>(a) on the date on which the enforcement notice is issued occupies the land to which the notice relates by virtue of a licence (the consent of the owner whether oral, written or implied); and</p>

<p>(b) continues so to occupy the land when the appeal is brought.</p>

<p>If you “have an interest” or are a “relevant occupier” you may appeal even if the notice has not been served on you.</p>

<p>Sometimes, more than one person may have a legal interest in the land to which an enforcement notice relates and their different interests may conflict with each other. For example, the owner of the land may wish the enforcement notice to be upheld, while the occupier of the land may wish to continue with the present use and/or retain the works. In these circumstances, it is up to each person with a legal interest to decide how his or her interests will best be served once an enforcement notice has been issued.</p>

<p>If you own the land and you do not appeal against an enforcement notice but someone else does appeal against it, in law you will have the status of an ‘interested person’. This does not entitle you to receive a copy of all the representations made by the appellant and other interested people (though you would be able to see such representations at the LPA’s offices).</p>

<p>However, in those circumstances, you may wish to request to be considered as an ‘interested owner’. This status is given at our discretion. It means that we will give you similar treatment as to an appellant. You will be able to attend any hearing or local inquiry, or be present when the Inspector visits the site. You will also be able to see and comment on any written representations made by the appellant, the LPA, and any other interested people, during the progress of the appeal. It is important you notify us to request this at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>A person</p>

<ul>
  <li>who does not have an interest in the land or is not a relevant occupier; or</li>
  <li>who is a trespasser;</li>
</ul>

<p>does not have a right of appeal – even if the local planning authority serves a copy of the enforcement notice on them.</p>

<h3>Lawful development certificates</h3>

<p>Section 177(1) of the 1990 Act gives the Secretary of State certain discretionary powers on the determination of an enforcement notice appeal under section 174. Section 177(1)(c), enables him to determine whether, on the date the appeal was made, any existing use of the land was lawful, any operations which had been carried out were lawful, or any matter constituting a failure to comply with a condition or limitation subject to which planning permission was granted was lawful.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances the Inspector may issue a certificate of lawful use or development (usually referred to as a lawful development certificate (LDC)) when determining your appeal. However, the LDC procedure is intended to be administered primarily by LPAs. They are usually best placed to identify all the relevant details about a use, operation or activity which may need to be specified in an LDC. These details, including suitable plans to attach to the certificate, may not be readily available to the Secretary of State or an Inspector, even at the decision stage of an enforcement notice appeal.</p>

<p>Therefore, except very rarely, where an enforcement appeal succeeds on grounds (c) or (d) in section 174(2), the notice will be quashed with no grant of a LDC and the appellant advised that it is open to him or her to apply to the LPA for an LDC under section 191.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, a fee is payable to the LPA for an LDC application. If an LDC were, exceptionally, to be granted on your appeal, the “deemed application fee” would not be refunded.</p>

<h3>Openness and transparency</h3>

<p>Hearings and inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the local planning authority in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for submitting documents</h2>

<h3>Acceptable file formats</h3>

<p>PDF .pdf
Microsoft Word .doc or.docx
TIF .tif or .tiff
JPEG .jpg or .jpeg 
PNG .png 
ZIP .zip</p>

<h3>File sizes</h3>

<p>Documents submitted may be no bigger than 15mb each. It is your responsibility to keep your documents to a manageable size.
If you have documents that are larger than this, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Break long documents into several files, but note the document naming conventions below.</li>
  <li>Try and use black and white wherever possible (unless submitting photographs).</li>
  <li>If submitting images, your software may have file/image compression facilities to make them smaller.</li>
  <li>Note scanned documents are usually bigger than non-scanned versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Provided you are using the acceptable file types above, you can use ZIP files to compress documents.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Remove any document security and enable macros if necessary. Documents should not be password protected, they should not be formatted as ‘read only’ and printing should be enabled.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Ensure you have the owner’s permission and have paid any copyright licence fee before sending in documents.</p>

<h3>File names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all documents have descriptive names, including the type of document you are sending, eg ‘Proposed plan 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Number appendices and submit them as separate documents. Ensure the first page includes the appendix number. Name them to indicate what they form part of, and their sequence eg ‘Appeal statement Appendix 2 Traffic census.’</li>
  <li>Use ‘Part 1’, ‘Part 2’ etc in the file name if you have split up a large document eg ‘Appeal statement in Appendix 1 Environmental Assessment Part 1 of 3’.</li>
  <li>Include the required paper size in the document name for plans and drawings eg ‘Proposed plan A3 size 1 March 2014’.</li>
  <li>Include scale bar(s) on all plans and drawings.</li>
  <li>Do not use a colon ‘:’ in any file names.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scanning</h3>

<p>Ensure documents are complete and legible and avoid scanning more than one document into a single file. Use black and white unless colour is essential.</p>

<h3>Ordnance Survey</h3>

<p>People may only scan an Ordnance Survey map if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an annual licence to make copies; or</li>
  <li>Have purchased a bulk copy arrangement; or</li>
  <li>Are using a local planning authority supplied map under the ‘map re-turn scheme’ (for which a fee is normally payable at the local planning authority’s discretion), or</li>
  <li>Have purchased the site-specific map for the purposes of attaching to a planning application, appeal or representation.
<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/licensing.html" rel="external">More information on map licensing is available on the Ordnance Survey web-site</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Send pictures, photographs, plans, maps or drawings as individual files. Avoid the use of bitmap images as they are very large.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks within documents you send to us. In-stead, you should download such documents yourself and attach them separately.</li>
  <li>You should not use hyperlinks to a website page containing multiple documents or links.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sending emails</h3>

<p>If you send anything by email you should get an automatic acknowledgement, provided it is sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk">appeals@planninginspectorate.gov.uk</a> or to a team email address (which can be found at the top of letters from us about the appeal). If you do not get an automatic acknowledgement, then you should contact us.</p>

<p>For any correspondence which you send to us via email, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quote the appeal reference and/or appellant’s name, site address and local planning authority name in the subject line or in the body of your email.</li>
  <li>If you are attaching more than one document, please list them in the covering email.</li>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you number all pages accordingly.</p>

<h3>Application for appeal costs</h3>

<p>You and the LPA normally have to meet your own appeal expenses, whether we decide it by the written procedure, a hearing or an inquiry.</p>

<p>If a party does not behave reasonably they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them. This would be on the basis that the behaviour had directly caused another party to incur expenses that would not otherwise have been necessary.</p>

<p>Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also the Inspector may make an award of costs even if neither to the parties has made an application.
There is <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/appeals">guidance about costs awards in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance</a>.</p>

<p>It is important that you read this guidance because it explains how, and on what basis you can make an application or have an application made against you.</p>

<p>The onus is on you to ensure that a properly substantiated claim for costs is made at the appropriate time.
<a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/apply-for-an-award-of-appeal-costs-application-form">There is a model costs application form on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Selecting the correct appeal form</h2>

<p>Once you have logged into your account, start the appeal process by clicking on the ‘Make a new appeal’ button.</p>

<h3>Enter the name of your local planning authority</h3>

<p>Here you should type in the name of your local planning authority. As you type, possible matches will be returned. You can then select the correct one from the list. Note you cannot change your local authority once you are in the appeal form.</p>

<h3>Selecting your appeal form</h3>

<p>You will be asked a series of questions about your appeal, with each answer you give determining the next question. You may need to consult the enforcement notice issued from your LPA.
If you want to make an appeal in relation to more than one enforcement notice or in relation to eg an application for planning permission, you must make a separate appeal for each. 
If you believe that you may have selected the wrong from, please select the ‘Restart’ button to begin the appeals process again.</p>

<h3>Meaningful name</h3>

<p>This name will be used to identify this appeal on your personal homepage. Please use a name that clearly identifies the appeal to you, for example, the first line of the site address. This is of particular importance if you are an agent who may be dealing with multiple cases.</p>

<h2>Completing the appeal form</h2>

<p>In this guidance, we use the same section headers as within the enforcement notice appeal form.</p>

<h3>Appellant Details</h3>

<p><strong>Name</strong></p>

<p><strong>Preferred contact method</strong></p>

<p>Please see earlier section ‘Who can appeal?’ to ensure that you are entitled to 
appeal against the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>If you are an unrepresented appellant and you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If for any reason your details have changed since you created your account, you should change them through the My Details link at the top of the page.</p>

<h2>Additional Appellants</h2>

<p>If you intend to submit appeals against this enforcement notice by more than one person at the same address, please include relevant details here.</p>

<h2>Agent Details</h2>

<p>You do not have to employ an agent to handle your enforcement appeal. If you decide to employ an agent he or she will probably complete the appeal form for you.</p>

<p>If you have an agent we will send all of our communications to them. We will not send a copy to you. The only exception to this is that we will send you and your agent a copy of the appeal decision. You should ensure that you keep in touch with your agent about the appeal arrangements, particularly times and dates for site visits, hearings or inquiries.</p>

<h3>Preferred contact method</h3>

<p>If you prefer to be contacted by email, where possible, we will send you our letters and appeals correspondence by email and we will not send paper copies.</p>

<p>If you are the agent completing the form, by selecting ‘No’ to the question ‘Are you the appellant?’ the details registered to your account will be displayed on the Agent Details section of the form.</p>

<h2>Local Planning Authority Details</h2>

<p>This information should all be on the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>The name of the LPA and relevant details of the enforcement notice will have transferred through to the form from when you entered it at the start of the process. If you need to change the LPA you will need to restart from your homepage.</p>

<h2>Appeal Site Details</h2>

<p>The appeal site must be the same as the site given in the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>If you confirm that the address of the affected land is the same as the appellant’s address then this information will transfer over from the Appellant Details section (provided you have completed the Appellant Details section before the Appeal Site Details section).</p>

<h3>Does the appeal relate to an existing property?</h3>

<p>If the address of the affected building is not the same as the appellant’s address you will be asked an additional question as to whether the appeal relates to an existing property. If it does, you can use the address finder to complete your details quickly.</p>

<h3>Postcode</h3>

<p>If the appeal site does not have a postcode, please provide the postcode of the nearest building. Also please provide information to help us identify the site, eg a map or plan showing the site and at least 2 named or numbered local roads.</p>

<h3>Health and safety at the site</h3>

<p>The site is likely to be inspected during the course of the appeal and the Inspector needs to be made aware of any potential problems. The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered.</p>

<p>We take seriously our duties with regard to the health and safety of our employees and those affected by our work. Inspectors may abort the site visit if the conditions on site are unsatisfactory. Failure to provide the necessary information may therefore result in a delay to your appeal.</p>

<p>The following questions indicate the type of information we need about the appeal site, such as the condition of the land or any building to be entered. Please note that the questions do not actually feature on the appeal form. The information should be supplied within the free text field underneath the Health and Safety question.</p>

<p>1)	Will the Inspector be expected to wear Personal Protection Equipment? Please give details.</p>

<p>2)	Are any building works or other operations taking place on the site? If it is a workplace, is there a risk assessment in place for visitors?</p>

<p>3)	Are there any animals (eg pets or livestock) within the site? If so, you <strong>must</strong> ensure that <strong>ALL</strong> animals (both livestock or pets) will be kept away from the area to be visited.</p>

<p>4)	Is the site remote or in an area likely to have a poor mobile phone signal?</p>

<p>5)	Are there any areas that require specialist equipment or training for access e.g. confined spaces or use of ladders / scaffolding? If a ladder will be used, you must explain why and give details of the heights involved and arrangements for securing the ladder.</p>

<p>6)	Does the Inspector need to be aware of specific dangers within the site? This would include uneven surfaces, equipment or substances kept at the site, risk of exposure to chemicals, asbestos or radiation.</p>

<p>7)	Will it be necessary to view the site from a height, e.g. roof, balcony? Are any railings or guards in place?</p>

<p>8)	Are there any site specific safety arrangements in place?</p>

<p>9)     Is the site accessible for persons with limited mobility?</p>

<p>10)   Is there any overgrown vegetation that could restrict access to the site? If so, you will need to ensure that the site is made accessible to our Inspector and any other people accompanying him or her.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> also inform us of any relevant changes to the site which occur in the period leading up to the planned site visit date.</p>

<h3>Interest in the land</h3>

<p>‘Interest in the land’ is explained in the earlier section ‘Who can appeal?’.</p>

<p>Please state your interest in the land. If it is none of the above you will need to indicate whether you/the appellant occupied the land/building under a written or oral licence BOTH on the date the enforcement notice was issued AND on the making of this appeal?. Use the text box to explain your interest.</p>

<p>Please see previous ‘Who can appeal?’ section for an explanation.</p>

<h2>Grounds and Facts</h2>

<h3>Planning obligation</h3>

<p>A planning obligation - often referred to as a ‘section 106 agreement’ – is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a legal agreement made between the LPA and a person ‘interested in the land’; or</li>
  <li>a legally binding undertaking signed unilaterally by a person ‘interested in the land’.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you intend to rely on a planning obligation you should send a draft version with your appeal form. The “start letter” we will send you will tell you when you must send the final draft to us. For further information please see Annexe I of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement notice appeals – England”</a></p>

<h3>Issues in contention and identifying of common ground</h3>

<p>You should discuss your development with the LPA before you make your appeal. You should agree what the key issues of contention are for the appeal. This will enable both parties to identify and agree any common ground and focus upon the key issues to be considered during the appeal process.</p>

<p>For inquiry cases you are required to send to us a <strong>statement of common ground</strong> not later than 4 weeks before the inquiry. You should begin discussing this with the LPA before you make your appeal. The statement of common ground should include basic facts such as site description, area, planning history, relevant planning policies, evidence on technical issues and conditions and all other matters of agreement. You should also list the specific areas where agreement is not possible.</p>

<p>For further information please see Annexe D, paragraph D.9 of our <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-procedural-guide">“Procedural Guide: Enforcement notice appeals – England”</a></p>

<h3>The different grounds of appeal/Statement of Appeal</h3>

<p>As directed by Regulation 6 of the Town and Country Planning (Enforcement Notices and Appeals) (England) Regulations 2002, a person lodging an appeal is required to submit a written Statement of Appeal specifying the grounds on which appeal against the notice is being made and setting out briefly the facts on which that person proposes to rely in support of each of those grounds.</p>

<p>There are 7 different grounds, in section 174(2) of the Act, on which you can make your appeal. You may wish to appeal on one ground only or on several grounds. The following is information about the different grounds and advice on what to include in your grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>Your appeal must give facts in support of each chosen ground of appeal. You should think carefully about the facts on which you will rely.</p>

<p>Ground (a) - that planning permission should be granted for what is alleged in the notice (or that the condition or limitation referred to in the enforcement notice should be removed).</p>

<p>If you appeal on ground (a) you should set out in detail why you think that planning permission should be granted. 
<strong>If you want your appeal to be considered under ground (a) you must pay a fee for the deemed planning application and you must plead ground (a).</strong>
The LPA should have told you the fee that is payable when it served the enforcement notice. If you <strong>only</strong> put ground (a) forward and you do not pay the fee, your appeal will lapse. This means that your appeal will end.</p>

<p>You must pay the full fee for the deemed planning application to the LPA. Further information about fees is given in the “Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012, Statutory Instrument No. 2012 2920”.</p>

<h3>Retrospective planning application</h3>

<p>If you made a retrospective planning application after the LPA issued the enforcement notice, the LPA <strong>may</strong> decline to determine your application under section 70C of the Act (as amended). You cannot appeal against an LPA’s decision to decline to determine your planning application. Therefore if the LPA <strong>does</strong> decline any retrospective application the only way you could ask for the planning merits of the alleged development to be considered is to appeal on ground (a) on your enforcement appeal <strong>and pay the fee</strong>.</p>

<p>However if you (or anyone else) had already made a retrospective planning application for the same development to the LPA and it issued the enforcement notice before the time to decide the application had expired, no-one can appeal against the enforcement notice on ground (a). The applicant for planning permission can, in these circumstances, make a planning appeal if the LPA refuse or fail to determine the planning application. This is specified at section 174 (2A)(b) of the Act (as amended).</p>

<h3>Withdrawal of appeal and refund of the fee</h3>

<p>If you withdraw your appeal so that there are at least 21 days <strong>between</strong> the date we <strong>receive written notice</strong> from you that you want to withdraw the appeal and the date of the site visit, hearing, or inquiry any fee you have paid will be refunded by the LPA. If you withdraw your appeal later than this your fee will not be refunded.</p>

<h3>If you plead ground (a)</h3>

<p>The Inspector will look at the planning merits of your development and so there is no need to give a detailed history of discussions with LPA officers.</p>

<p>You should avoid repetition and information that does not relate to the issues involved. The grounds of appeal should be clear and concise and we would not expect them to exceed 3,000 words.</p>

<p>Do not repeat the LPA’s reasons for issuing the enforcement notice but you should include a clear explanation of why you disagree with each of them. It is not enough to say that you do not accept them. 
The enforcement notice will refer to policies in the Development Plan and/or supplementary planning documents in the Local Development Framework. Do not describe any local policies in full. Simply give the number and the name of the relevant development plan or supplementary planning document and give paragraph numbers if appropriate. The LPA will provide these to the Inspector so you do not need to. However, before making your appeal you should read the policies referred to. You should include in your grounds of appeal why you think that any policy referred to in the notice is not relevant or why the development complies with it.</p>

<p>If you think there are other relevant policies, not referred to in the LPA’s decision, but on which you intend to rely, you should attach the relevant extracts and include them with your appeal, indicating their status, ie whether they have been adopted by the LPA and/or have been saved by a direction of the Secretary of State and form part of the Local Development Framework.</p>

<p>There is no need to set out national policy (such as the National Planning Policy Framework) as Inspectors have access to these documents. However, you should refer to any paragraphs by number that you think are relevant.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to attach previous decisions by the LPA or on appeal if they are directly relevant but you should indicate why you consider them to be so.</p>

<p>You may include details of similar developments in the immediate area if you think these are relevant to what you have done. You should identify them on a street map and supply their addresses and, where possible, photographs of them. Where you are aware of the history of any such development you should set it out briefly in your grounds of appeal or in a separate annexe.</p>

<p>Where the effect on the neighbours is mentioned in the notice, if you dispute this you should include measurements (in metric units) of the distances between your and your neighbours’ properties, particularly the distances to any of their windows. If your neighbours do not allow you access to their property you should provide approximate measurements.</p>

<h3>Planning conditions</h3>

<p>You should indicate if you wish to accept or can suggest a planning condition(s) that you think would mitigate the impact of the development if the appeal is successful on ground (a). 
You should look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="/guidance/use-of-planning-conditions">Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities planning practice guidance on the use of planning conditions</a> and</li>
  <li>Appendix A – “Suggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstances” (which is still in existence) to Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission (which has been cancelled).</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that conditions are suggested in relation to any ground (a) does not mean that the appeal will be allowed on ground (a) and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be imposed.</p>

<h3>The “legal grounds”</h3>

<p>The following grounds (b), (c), (d) and (e) are often referred to as “the legal grounds”. If you are pleading any of these grounds <strong>it is your responsibility to provide evidence to prove what you are saying</strong>.</p>

<p>**Ground (b) ** - That the breach of control alleged in the enforcement notice has not occurred as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>If you plead ground (b) you are saying that whatever is alleged in the notice has not taken place (ie that the alleged use is not occurring or that the alleged structure has not been erected). You should provide facts to support this. You may wish to show the difference between the actual use (or lack of it) and what is alleged in the notice.</p>

<p>If you wish to argue that planning permission is not needed, do not do that under ground (b). You should do that under ground (c).</p>

<p>**Ground (c) ** - That there has not been a breach of planning control.</p>

<p>You may wish to claim that:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>the operations alleged in the notice do not amount to development, under section 55 of the Act, or that the change of use is not a material one (ie it is not subject to the requirements of planning control);</li>
  <li>the development that has taken place is permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 Statutory Instrument 2015 No. 596, or that the change of use is within the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 Statutory Instrument 1987 No. 764 (as amended);</li>
  <li>what has been done, or built, is within the terms of a planning permission, or that the relevant condition on a permission has been complied with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note - Sometimes there is confusion about ground (b) and ground (c). Put simply, ground (b) is that you did not do it, and ground (c) is that you did, but planning permission is not needed.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (d)</strong> – That at the time the enforcement notice was issued it was too late to take enforcement action against the matters stated in the notice.</p>

<p>The time limits are as follows:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 171B(1) of the Act gives a time limit of 4 years for notices alleging operational development such as building, mining or engineering works.</li>
  <li>section 171B(2) gives a 4 year limit for change of use from a building/part of a building to a single dwellinghouse. This time limit applies either where the change to use as a single dwellinghouse involves development without planning permission, or where it involves a failure to comply with a condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted.</li>
  <li>section 171B(3) states that any other change is subject to a limit of 10 years from the date of the breach. This applies to changes of use and to breaches of any conditions attached to previous planning permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not enough to say “The breach of planning control occurred more than 10 years ago”, or “The building was finished more than 4 years before the notice was issued”. You need to be able to provide evidence to establish this.</p>

<p>**Ground (e) ** – That the notice was not properly served on everyone with an interest in the land. 
You will need show that copies of the notice were not served as required by section 172: 
     (2) A copy of the enforcement notice shall be served:-</p>

<p>(a) on the owner and on the occupier of the land to which it relates; and</p>

<p>(b) on any other person having an interest in the land, being an interest which, in the opinion of the authority, is materially affected by the notice.</p>

<p>(3) The service of the notice shall take place:-</p>

<p>(a) not more than 28 days after its date of issue; and</p>

<p>(b) not less than 28 days before the date specified in it as the date which it is to take effect.</p>

<p>Note - If the notice was not served as specified in section 172, this can be disregarded if no substantial prejudice has been caused to anyone’s interests. For example if the appellant or other person is present at the inquiry/hearing or sent written representations it is likely that he or she has been given adequate notice. 
You should provide the details of anyone who has an interest in the land. You should indicate who received the notice and who did not.</p>

<p><strong>Ground (f) - The Act says</strong> “that the steps required by the notice to be taken, or the activities required by the notice to cease, exceed what is necessary to remedy any breach of planning control which may be constituted by those matters or, as the case may be, to remedy any injury to amenity which has been caused by any such breach”;  This means that steps required to comply with the requirements of the enforcement notice are excessive and lesser steps would overcome the objections.</p>

<p>You should say why you think that the steps are excessive and what lesser steps you consider would remedy the problem. You cannot argue that planning permission should be granted under this ground. If you wish the planning merits of the development to be considered you must argue that under ground (a). 
**Ground (g) ** – That the time given to comply with the notice is too short.</p>

<p>You should say what you consider to be a more reasonable period and why. If you intend to appeal solely on this ground you should consider negotiating the timescale with the LPA, as it may be willing to extend the period for compliance, removing the need for an appeal.</p>

<h2>Choice of Procedure</h2>

<p>There are 3 possible procedures for the determination of an appeal: written representations, hearings and inquiries. We will decide which procedure your appeal should follow. Our decision will be based on the criteria which are set out in Annexe 1. We will also take into account any views you have expressed about which procedure would be most suitable for your case and the views of the LPA.</p>

<p>You should note if we decide at the initial stage that the appeal should proceed as a hearing or as an inquiry, the appointed Inspector will also subsequently consider, whether a ‘combined procedure’ would be appropriate, such as a hearing with some elements dealt with written representations or an inquiry with hearing and/or written representation elements, on the basis of the criteria.</p>

<p>We will keep the determined procedure, including any combined procedure, under review during the appeal and may change it at any point before a decision on the appeal is made.</p>

<p><strong>Please refer to Annexe 1 before indicating which is your preferred procedure.</strong></p>

<h3>The written representations procedure</h3>

<p>This is normally the most straightforward way of making an appeal, it is simpler to undertake than a hearing or inquiry. Over 60% of enforcement appeals proceed by the written procedure. The Inspector will consider the LPA’s reasons for issuing the enforcement notice, your grounds of appeal, any further representations received from you and the LPA and any representation received from interested people. The Inspector will usually visit the site.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at “The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Written Representations Procedure) (England) Regulations 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2683”.</p>

<p>We will use your responses to questions 1a) and 1b) to help us decide how the site visit should be conducted.</p>

<h3>The hearing procedure</h3>

<p>This procedure is likely to be suited to more complicated cases which require detailed discussion about the merits of a proposal (for an appeal on ground (a)) or where questions need to be asked to establish the facts. The hearing is an inquisitorial process led by the Inspector who identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made. The hearing may include a discussion at the site or the site may be visited, on an accompanied (without any discussion), or unaccompanied basis.</p>

<p>If you ask for a hearing you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for a hearing. Although you may indicate a preference for a hearing, we must also consider that your appeal is suitable for this procedure. It will not be suitable if the evidence needs to be tested eg by cross examination where the factual evidence about how long the development has been on site is in dispute.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at “The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Hearings Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2684”.</p>

<h3>The inquiry procedure</h3>

<p>This is the most formal of the appeal procedures. Although it is not a court of law the proceedings will often seem to be quite similar. An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, evidence, usually through expert witnesses. Parties may be formally represented by advocates and evidence will sometimes be given on oath. The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>If you ask for an inquiry you should explain on the appeal form why you think your appeal fits the criteria for an inquiry. Although you may indicate a preference for an inquiry, we must be satisfied that your appeal is suitable for this procedure.</p>

<p>You may wish to look at “The Town and Country Planning (Enforcement) (Determination by Inspectors) (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2002, Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2685”.</p>

<h3>How long do you estimate the inquiry will last?</h3>

<p>In answering question 3(a) you should say how long you estimate the inquiry will last, including the time you think will be required to present all of your case. Please be realistic - the estimate should include time for opening and closing the inquiry, any sessions on conditions and any section 106 obligation and the time you consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both your and the LPA’s witnesses. If you have instructed someone to represent you at the inquiry (your “advocate”) it may be useful for you to get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<p>We will take account of your estimate, the estimate we receive from the LPA and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry. Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable.</p>

<p>To help us to do this please indicate at Q3(b) how many witnesses you intend to call to give evidence at the inquiry and the topic areas they will cover and any other information which will help us decide on the appropriate timetable for the inquiry. If you have an advocate it may be useful for you to get their views on this.</p>

<h2>Fee for the deemed planning application</h2>

<p><strong>Q1</strong> If you have applied for planning permission and paid the appropriate fee for the same development as is in the enforcement notice you should provide the date of that application, and the date of the LPA’s decision if it has determined it.</p>

<p>You are exempt from the need to pay the fee for the deemed application contained in ground (a) if:</p>

<p>i) the planning application was made before the date the enforcement notice was issued and the application had not been decided by that date; OR</p>

<p>ii) before the enforcement notice is to take effect you made an appeal against the LPA’s refusal to grant planning permission and on the date on which the enforcement notice is to take effect that appeal had not been determined.</p>

<p>If i) applies please answer “Yes” at Q2. 
If ii) applies please answer “Yes” at Q2 and write the reference of your current planning appeal in the space provided.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong> Planning applications and enforcement appeals are exempt from the need to pay a fee if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>relate solely to:</li>
</ul>

<p>(a) the carrying out of operations for the alteration or extension of an existing dwellinghouse; or</p>

<p>(b) the carrying out of operations (other than the erection of a dwellinghouse) in the curtilage of an existing dwellinghouse; for the purpose, in either case, of providing means of access to or within the dwellinghouse for a disabled person who is resident in, or is proposing to take up residence in, that dwellinghouse, or of providing facilities designed to secure his greater safety, health or comfort.</p>

<p>A “disabled person” is defined as-</p>

<p>(a) a person who is within any of the descriptions of persons to whom section 29 of the National Assistance Act 1948 applies; or</p>

<p>(b) a child who is disabled for the purposes of Part III of the Children Act 1989.</p>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the LPA to whom the application is made is satisfied that it relates solely to the carrying out of operations for the purpose of providing means of access for disabled persons to or within a building or premises to which members of the public are admitted (whether on payment or otherwise);</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development, that is normally permitted, requires planning permission because the permitted development rights have been withdrawn by a direction made by the LPA under Article 4 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015;</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development, that is normally permitted, requires planning permission because of a condition on a planning permission which restricts permitted development;</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development is for another purpose, in the same Use Class as that for which the building or land is used but permission is necessary because of the requirements of a condition on the original planning permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel one of these circumstances apply, please explain why and attach any relevant documentation. 
If you are <strong>not</strong> exempt from paying the fee you should send the full fee to the LPA with the copy of the appeal form.</p>

<h2>Other appeals</h2>

<p>If you have made any other related appeals which have not yet been decided on this site or for nearby sites please supply the reference numbers. Where practical, and depending on the relevant timescales, we may consider related cases together.</p>

<h2>Supporting Documents</h2>

<p>Any supporting documentation other than a copy of the enforcement notice and plan as required in this section of the appeal form should be kept to a minimum and should be essential and directly relevant to the appeal. Such documentation should be clearly cross-referenced to your representations on ground (a).</p>

<p>You may wish to send appendices to your representations. These can include reports and information that relate directly to the reasons for issuing the enforcement notice. Appendices should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>You may use photographs (preferably in colour) to illustrate your grounds of appeal – for example to show the site and its relationship to its neighbours. If you send photographs you must give details of where they were taken, on a map showing the viewpoints, and when and what they show. If you take photographs in public places please take reasonable care to respect the privacy of individuals whose images you may inadvertently capture. We are unable to return photographs.</p>

<h3>Audio/Video</h3>

<p>We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or vid-eo evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence.</p>

<p>However, you may send a written summary within 6 weeks of the starting date for the appeal.</p>

<p>If the appeal will proceed by a hearing or inquiry, you may ask the Inspector at the event if they are willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing/inquiry.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to contact the LPA to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector it will become part of the hearing/inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h2>Annexe 1: Criteria for determining the procedure for planning, listed building, enforcement, hazardous substances, advertisement and discontinuance notice appeals</h2>

<p>**The criteria for each procedure cannot be fully prescriptive or entirely determinative: they require judgement to be applied using common sense. More than one criterion may apply.</p>

<p>Written representations** - written representations would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the planning issues raised or, in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, can be clearly understood from the appeal documents and a site inspection (if required - A small number of appeals do not require a site visit and can be dealt with solely on the basis of the appeal documents); or</li>
  <li>the issues are not complex and the Inspector is not likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify any other matters; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are clear.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong> - a hearing would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Inspector is likely to need to test the evidence by questioning or to clarify matters (for example, where detailed evidence on housing land supply needs to be tested by questioning); or</li>
  <li>the status or personal circumstances of the appellant are at issue (for example, whether in traveller appeals the definition in Annex 1 of DLUHC’s planning policy for traveller sites is met); or</li>
  <li>there is no need for evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate or given on oath; or</li>
  <li>the case has generated a level of local interest such as to warrant a hearing; or</li>
  <li>it can reasonably be expected that the parties will be able to present their own cases (supported by professional witnesses if required) without the need for an advocate to represent them; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the grounds of appeal, the alleged breach, and the requirements of the notice, are relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inquiry</strong> - an inquiry would be appropriate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is a clearly explained need for the evidence to be tested through formal questioning by an advocate (this does not preclude an appellant representing themselves as an advocate); or</li>
  <li>the issues are complex (for example, where large amounts of highly technical data are likely to be provided in evidence); or</li>
  <li>the appeal has generated substantial local interest to warrant an inquiry as opposed to dealing with the case by a hearing; or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, evidence needs to be given on oath (for example, where witnesses are giving factual evidence about how long the alleged unauthorised use has been taking place); or</li>
  <li>in an enforcement appeal, the alleged breach, or the requirements of the notice, are unusual and particularly contentious.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - It is considered that the prospect of legal submissions being made is not, on its own, a reason why a case would need to be conducted by inquiry. Where a party considers that legal submissions will be required (and are considered to be complex such as to warrant being made orally), the Inspectorate requires that the matters on which submissions will be made are fully explained – including why they may require an inquiry - at the outset of the appeal or otherwise at the earliest opportunity.</p>
