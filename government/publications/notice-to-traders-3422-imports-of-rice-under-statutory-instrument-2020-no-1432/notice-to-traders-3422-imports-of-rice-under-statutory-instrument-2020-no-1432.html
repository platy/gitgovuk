<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This notice explains the rules for the Rice quota for the period of 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and how to apply for a licence. It also advises you of the quota amounts available in the May 2022 application window and details of the quantities available are given in Annex 1 of this notice.</p>

<h3>Proof of Trade</h3>
<p>You must provide the following documents to prove that you are eligible for a rice quota licence. If you do not have the proof of trade detailed below, you are not eligible, and you cannot apply for a quota licence.
You must be established and registered for VAT in the UK. You must tell us your current VAT registration number. You can provide your VAT number on your quota licence application or send us a copy of your current VAT certificate. However, if your company is part of a group VAT registration number, we will need to see a copy of your current VAT certificate before the quota deadline.</p>

<p>As this is the first application in the quota year you must provide evidence to prove that you have imported at least 25 tonnes of rice during:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 12-month period ending two months before the first application can be submitted for the 2021 quota year (17 September 2020 to 16 September 2021); and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 12-month period immediately before that (17 September 2019 to 16 September 2020).
HMRC agents or representatives cannot apply for import licences under these quota arrangements.
Note: For details of the full procedures on providing proof of trade and applying for licences, please refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-to-traders-9021-imports-of-cereals-under-statutory-instrument-2020-number1432">Notice to Traders 91/20.</a> If this notice is not available on the gov.uk website, you can obtain a copy by sending an email request to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not follow the rules of the scheme, your application will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>Your quota application must be received between 1st and 6th May 2022. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application, all supporting documents and the security are correct at the time of submission and they are received by the RPA before 5pm on 6 May 2022.
Note: We will reject any applications where the application, security and / or proof of trade are received after 5pm on 6 May 2022.</p>

<p>Any unused quota will be carried forward to the next application period in June 2022.
You must submit your licence applications using an AGRIM import licence application form. We advise you to use the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agrim-import-licence-application-form-for-agricultural-products">application form</a>. You can submit applications either by post or by email. The email address for licence applications is <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:trader@rpa.gov.uk">trader@rpa.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>Your application must not exceed the quantity available in each sub-period for the country of origin of product in which you are applying.</p>

<p>You must not lodge more than one import quota licence application for the same order number in a sub-period, unless it is accompanied by an export licence or certificate.
Note: If you lodge more than one application for the same order number, all your applications will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>You must lodge security with each licence application. The following amounts must be provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£40 per tonne for applications under CN codes 1006 30;</li>
  <li>£40 per tonne for applications under CN codes 1006 20;</li>
  <li>£5 per tonne for applications under CN codes 1006 4000.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find further information on how to lodge your security by searching for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licence-securities-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">‘Licence securities for the import/export of agricultural products’</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Issuing Licences</h3>

<p>As soon as the application period has closed, we will collate details of all valid quota applications we received and calculate the reduction coefficient applicable to each order number. Details of these <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-tariff-rate-quotas-allocation-of-co-efficients">reduction coefficients</a> will be published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Licences will be issued electronically towards the end of May for use from 1 June 2022.
The reduction in duty will only be valid for the quantities shown in sections 17 and 18 of your licence.
As licences will only be valid for imports into the UK, your licence will be issued electronically. We no longer issue paper import licences.</p>

<p>Import licences will be valid from 1 June 2022 until the end of the 2022 quota period (31 December 2022). Where an electronic licence is issued an email can be sent to inform you of its issue. To receive this email notification, you must have already completed the appropriate sections of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/licences-for-the-importexport-of-agricultural-products">il3 form</a>.</p>

<h3>Using Licences</h3>

<p>When making your import entry to HMRC, you must state whether your rice is in packages of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 kg or less; or</li>
  <li>Over 5 kg.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Authority</h2>
<p>You can find details of the arrangements in Statutory Instrument 2020/1432. You can obtain copies from Stationery Office bookshops and accredited agents, or order from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tsoshop.co.uk/" rel="external">Stationery Office</a> website.</p>

<p>You can also access Statutory Instruments electronically by visiting the UK’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1432/contents/made" rel="external">Legislation website</a>.
