<p>The Environmental Permitting (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2016</p>

<h2>Introductory note</h2>

<p>This introductory note is a non-technical summary and does not form part of these standard rules. Operators will need to check all the rules in detail to make sure they can comply with them at all times.</p>

<p>Any standard permit issued for these rules by the Environment Agency will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name a specific operator who can use the permit</li>
  <li>include a site plan showing where the facility is and its extent</li>
  <li>include a fire prevention plan in Schedule 3</li>
  <li>require the operator to comply with these rules</li>
</ul>

<p>The permit allows the named operator to operate a vehicle storage, depollution and dismantling facility and permits the recovery of all waste motor vehicles at a specified location.</p>

<p>No more than 750 tonnes of waste vehicles may be accepted at the facility each year.</p>

<p>Burning of any wastes, either in the open, inside buildings or in any form of incinerator is not permitted.</p>

<p>The operations must be undertaken in accordance with the fire prevention plan in Schedule 3 of this permit.</p>

<p>These rules do not allow any point source emission into surface waters or groundwater. However, under the emissions of substances not controlled by emission limits rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>liquids may be discharged into a sewer subject to a consent issued by the local water company</li>
  <li>liquids may be taken off-site in a tanker for disposal or recovery</li>
  <li>clean surface water from roofs, or from areas of the site that are not being used in connection with storing and treating waste, may be discharged directly to surface waters, or to groundwater by seepage through the soil through a soakaway</li>
  <li>clean surface water from storage areas for fully depolluted vehicles, uncontaminated plastic, glass and ferrous and non- ferrous metal wastes arising from the treatment of end-of-life vehicles may discharge to a sealed drainage system or to surface waters or groundwater through drainage systems designed and constructed so water discharged does not adversely impact the water quality of receiving water bodies</li>
</ul>

<p>The facility must be a minimum distance from certain types of sensitive site. It cannot be within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>200 metres of a European site, Ramsar, Site of Special Scientific Interest or Marine Conservation Zone</li>
  <li>50 metres of a National Nature Reserve, Local Nature Reserve, Local Wildlife Site, Ancient Woodland or Scheduled Ancient Monument</li>
  <li>50 metres of a site that has species or habitats protected under the Biodiversity Action Plan that the Environment Agency considers at risk to this activity</li>
  <li>a groundwater source protection zone 1 or 2, or where a source protection zone has not been defined then not within 50 metres of any well, spring or borehole used for the supply of water for human consumption. This includes private water supplies</li>
  <li>10 metres of an unculverted watercourse</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> Measures to prevent and reduce the risk of fires at small End of Life Vehicle recycling sites</h3>

<p>The following sections contain the measures and requirements that shall be put in place to prevent the common causes of fires given in section 6.</p>

<h4>7.1 Batteries in <abbr title="end-of-life vehicles">ELVs</abbr>
</h4>

<p>All batteries must be removed or disconnected with the terminals taped as soon as practicable after the <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> arrives and before the <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> is stockpiled.</p>

<p>Lead acid batteries must be stored upright in acid resistant containers that prevent leaks and damage to batteries stored within them. These containers must be either lidded to prevent ingress of water, or the containers are stored in a designated area under cover.</p>

<p>7.1.1 Hybrids and electric vehicles</p>

<p>Batteries must be made safe (for example by removing the safety cut-off plug) as soon as practicable after a hybrid or electric <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> (<abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr>) arrives at the site and before being stockpiled. Vehicle batteries must be disconnected and the terminals taped or the battery must be removed as soon as practicable after the <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> arrives and before the <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> is stockpiled.</p>

<p>Different types of <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries must not be stored together. The <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries must be kept dry at all times and stored away from other combustible materials. The <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries must be stored so they are not exposed to elevated temperatures.</p>

<p><abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries must not be stacked on top of one another and no treatment, including disassembly of <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries, is allowed on site.</p>

<p>7.1.2 Lithium ion batteries</p>

<p>Lithium ion batteries present a serious fire risk and are also prone to re-ignition if they are involved in a fire and are not adequately cooled. In extreme cases thermal runaway is a risk in <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicles">EVs</abbr> with lithium ion batteries.</p>

<p>Fires can start if the battery is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>damaged</li>
  <li>exposed to moisture</li>
  <li>exposed to high temperatures</li>
</ul>

<p>To prevent fires occurring any battery that is, or is suspected to be, a lithium or lithium ion battery, must be checked for damage. If the battery is damaged, it must be stored in a watertight, lidded container filled with sand or vermiculite. The container must be capable of protecting the battery or batteries stored within it from further damage.</p>

<p>Some types of <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries are heavy. Batteries must be handled to prevent damage to the battery by impact or dropping. <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> batteries must not be stacked on top of one another or stored in a manner where they can fall or have items fall on them. This is to avoid crushing or puncturing the batteries.</p>

<p>7.1.3 Storage of different types of battery</p>

<p>Lead acid batteries, nickel metal hydride batteries and lithium ion batteries must be stored in separate containers.</p>

<h4>7.2 Waste pre-acceptance and acceptance</h4>

<p>No more than 10 waste motor vehicles shall be depolluted and dismantled each week.</p>

<p>Waste acceptance checks must be carried out to prevent and minimise the risk of fires. These checks include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying the fuel type of the <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr> so it can be appropriately depolluted</li>
  <li>checking for fuel leaks</li>
  <li>checking electric vehicles for damaged batteries and isolating vehicles with damaged batteries pending removal from the vehicle</li>
  <li>checking the boot and interior for contrary items like gas cylinders, LPG tanks and batteries and so on</li>
</ul>

<h4>7.3 Depollution</h4>

<p>The depollution area must be clearly designated and identified on the site plan. The following measures must be followed during depollution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a âfire watch or checkâ shall be undertaken at the end of each working day as well as frequent checks made during the hours of operation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CCTV and intruder alarms must be monitored and responded to both during working hours and out of hours â a list of contact details and who will respond out of hours must be maintained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a fire detection and alert system or systems must be in place and these must operate both within and out of working hours</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">11. </span> Suppressing fires</h3>

<p>The following measures shall be in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>site staff are trained on the equipment and methods for suppressing fires (where it is safe to do so)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a fire blanket suitable for use with vehicles is available to suppress a fire in an <abbr title="end-of-life vehicle">ELV</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fire extinguishers are located in key locations, including the depollution area, to tackle small-scale fires</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water supplies are available in accordance with water supplies section below</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>plant and equipment shall be available to move waste and other materials away from a fire, if safe to do so</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12. </span> Firefighting techniques</h3>

<p>In the event of a fire during operating hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the site must be immediately closed and cease accepting waste</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the Fire and Rescue Service shall be notified</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if safe to do so, a small fire may be tackled by site staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile plant, staff vehicles, vehicles for sale and <abbr title="end-of-life vehicles">ELVs</abbr> (where possible) shall be moved from the areas adjacent to the fire to prevent the fire spreading and escalating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where safe to do so, waste and items adjacent to the fire shall be moved to isolate the fire and minimise the amount of combustible materials and waste involved in the fire</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any drains on site shall be sealed off using clay mats or drain blockers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>measures shall be taken to prevent firewater leaving the site or entering ditches and drainage systems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the site shall remain closed to waste acceptance until declared safe to reopen by the emergency authorities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">13. </span> Water supplies</h3>

<p>One of the following water sources must be available for the site:</p>

<h4>Hydrant available</h4>

<p>A hydrant conforming to British Standard 750 or equivalent must be located within 100 metres of the site access and maintained by the Fire and Rescue Service or other competent maintenance organisation.</p>

<h4>Hydrant not available:</h4>

<p>A minimum 18,000 litres of water over a 4 hour period shall be available to assist fighting a fire on site. This supply can be through a combination of mains water and storage tanks. The coupling on the tank must be agreed with the local Fire and Rescue Service as compatible with their equipment. This tank or storage facility must be checked at least once a week to ensure it is holding the minimum 18,000 litres.</p>

<p>Additional volumes of water will be required to keep fires involving electric and hybrid vehicles (<abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicles">EVs</abbr>) and lithium ion batteries under control and to provide a cooling effect. Based on evidence, a fire in a single <abbr title="electric and hybrid vehicle">EV</abbr> could require 10,000 litres of water to extinguish.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">14. </span> Managing firewater</h3>

<p>Firewater must be contained and prevented from reaching sensitive receptors or causing pollution. Firewater shall be contained using a combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the impermeable pavement and areas of sealed drainage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sandbags or booms to keep firewater on site</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drain-blockers and clay mats to protect drainage systems to surface water and foul sewer (unless the water company has agreed firewater can be discharged to the foul sewer)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a tanker company must be contracted with a callout arrangement of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to recover firewater from contained areas and the drainage system. Firewater shall be characterised to ensure it is taken to an appropriately authorised facility</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15. </span> During and after an incident</h3>

<h4>15.1 Clearing, decontaminating and making the site operational after a fire</h4>

<p>Following a fire and before any waste is accepted on to site the following actions shall be carried out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any waste burnt during a fire shall be characterised and removed from site and disposed of at a suitably authorised facility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contaminated water within the drainage system shall be sampled, removed from site and taken to a suitably authorised facility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the site hardstanding, impermeable pavement and sealed drainage system shall be inspected for damage and contamination and any damage shall be reported to the Environment Agency regarding sampling and further investigation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any areas of hardstanding, impermeable pavement or sealed drainage system that are damaged shall be repaired prior to receipt of waste on the site</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if any waste containing persistent organic pollutants (<abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr>) is involved in a fire, residues from that fire and the firewater may contain <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> and must be treated in accordance with the <abbr title="persistent organic pollutants">POPs</abbr> Regulations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the cause of the fire shall be investigated, and any lessons learnt or improvements made to site procedures shall be documented, disseminated to all site staff and implemented</p>
  </li>
</ul>
