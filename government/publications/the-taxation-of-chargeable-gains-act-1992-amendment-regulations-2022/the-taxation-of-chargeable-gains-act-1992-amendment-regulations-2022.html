<h2>Who is likely to be affected</h2>

<p>Individuals who receive payments from non-resident trusts.</p>

<h2>General description of the measure</h2>

<p>This measure amends section 87A and Schedule 4C to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (<abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>). Both provisions contain references to section 2(2) of in the <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. In 2019 that particular provision was rewritten and its numbering changed to section 1(3).</p>

<p>This measure updates both provisions so that they correctly refer to section 1(3).</p>

<h2>Policy objective</h2>

<p>This measure provides certainty to individuals who receive payments from non-resident trusts by ensuring that the legislation reads as intended.</p>

<h2>Background to the measure</h2>

<p>Finance Act 2019, Schedule 1 brought into the scope of the capital gains regime the disposal of UK commercial properties by non-UK resident persons. This required the partial rewrite and renumbering of Part 1 of the <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. That renumbering had to be reflected in other Parts of the <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. It has been identified that one of the amendments made to section 87A <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr> to reflect this renumbering means that it does not read as intended. In addition, a clarificatory amendment to Schedule 4C was missed. This measure corrects that.</p>

<h2>Detailed proposal</h2>

<h3>Operative date</h3>

<p>This measure will take effect from 5 April 2022.</p>

<h3>Current law</h3>

<p>Section 87A <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr> applies to the beneficiaries of non-resident trusts and determines how much capital gains tax (<abbr title="capital gains tax">CGT</abbr>) they should pay. The legislation cross referred in a number of places to section 2(2) <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. Section 2(2) was a general provision that explained how to determine the amount of chargeable gain that <abbr title="capital gains tax">CGT</abbr> is charged on.</p>

<p>Finance Act 2019, Schedule 1 brought into the scope of the capital gains regime the disposal of UK commercial properties by non-UK resident persons. This required the partial rewrite and renumbering of Part 1 of the <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. As part of those changes section 2(2) <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>, was renumbered and became section 1(3) <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. This renumbering had to be reflected in other Parts of the Act. Section 2(2) now refers to corporation tax.</p>

<p>One consequential amendment made by Finance Act 2019, Schedule 1, Paragraph 36, was to section 87A <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr>. This amendment required the words ‘the section 2(2) amount’, which were used a number of times in section 87A, to be replaced by the words ‘the section 1(3) amount’, to reflect the renumbering of subsection 2(2).</p>

<p>However, subsection 87A(2) contained the words ‘with section 2(2) amounts’ and consequently still reads ‘with section 2(2) amounts’ rather than ‘with section 1(3) amounts’.</p>

<p>In addition, it has been identified that the heading to Paragraph 1A of Schedule 4C, which applies to transfers of value made by the trustees of trusts, still refers to section 2(2).</p>

<p>Finance Act 2019 provides a power at Schedule 1, Paragraph 124 enabling the Treasury to make changes to the <abbr title="Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992">TCGA</abbr> by regulations.</p>
