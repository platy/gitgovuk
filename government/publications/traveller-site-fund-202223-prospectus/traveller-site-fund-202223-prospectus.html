<h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>

<p>It is the government’s aim to increase the provision of traveller sites to address under provision, maintain an appropriate level of supply and reduce the level of unauthorised encampments. To support local authorities in improving accommodation provision for travellers, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) is providing £10 million for local authorities in England to bid in 2022/23 for capital costs of building new transit and permanent sites, to refurbish existing permanent and transit sites and provide temporary stopping places and facilities for travellers. <strong>The funding is available for the 2022/23 financial year only.</strong></p>

<p>As part of the government’s ambition to level up, the Traveller Site Fund will provide capital funding for local authorities in England to provide families with access to safe and secure places to stop, suitable facilities, access to local services such as health and education, and provide authorised sites that meet their needs.</p>

<p>The fund will support local authorities to provide additional transit and permanent sites and temporary stopping places to meet the accommodation needs of travellers. The fund can also be used for the refurbishment of existing transit and permanent sites to improve the living conditions and environments for residents. It will also enable local authorities to build on work already done to provide more authorised sites and provide facilities and access to services that improve the life chances of travellers, reduce community tensions and the associated harms and high costs of unauthorised encampments. The fund will not be used to fund any existing unauthorised sites.</p>

<p>The £10 million fund is in addition to the £11.5 billion <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-affordable-housing-funding">Affordable Homes Programme 2021/26 funding</a> - which can be used by both local authorities and Registered Social Housing providers for the provision of new permanent and transit sites. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/capital-funding-guide/3-specialist-homes-for-older-disabled-and-vulnerable-people#Traveller-pitches">details of the programme’s requirements for traveller pitches</a>.</p>

<p>This prospectus sets out details of the fund and provides guidance to local authorities in submitting a bid. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.communities.gov.uk/funding/30ada463/" rel="external">application form for the fund</a>.</p>

<h2>Section 2: Strategic Objectives</h2>

<p>The Traveller Site Fund has the following strategic objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the provision of transit and permanent sites and temporary stopping places in England to meet the needs of travellers as set out in a recent local authority assessment of needs;</li>
  <li>increase the use of authorised transit sites and temporary stopping places and provide appropriate accommodation in suitable locations;</li>
  <li>improve travellers’ life chances and social outcomes by providing pleasant, authorised places with facilities for travellers to live, and providing access to local services and facilities, particularly including education and health services;</li>
  <li>improve relations between travelling and settled communities; and</li>
  <li>reduce enforcement costs for local authorities and police in dealing with unauthorised encampments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 3: Eligibility</h2>

<p>All local authorities in England are eligible to bid for funding. Local authorities can work with partners such as housing associations, voluntary sector organisations and community-based organisations (including traveller organisations) in the delivery and management of the sites. We encourage joint bids with neighbouring authorities and both upper and lower tier authorities, as well as local partners such as police. The lead local authority will need to submit the application, be the lead partner and be accountable for the grant.</p>

<p>The fund can be used for new or improved accommodation for travellers who have their needs assessed under the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites or the National Planning Policy Framework. It can also be used for the provision of temporary stopping places.</p>

<p>Proposals for bricks and mortar accommodation for travellers are not within the remit of this fund. Other sources of funding, including the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-affordable-housing-funding">Affordable Homes Programme 2021-2026</a> are available for these types of accommodation.</p>

<p>This fund must not be used for an existing unauthorised encampment or unauthorised development.</p>

<p>Transit pitches on permanent sites will not be eligible for funding. Transit sites and temporary stopping places next to permanent sites are eligible as long as they are standalone sites.
Priority will be given to transit site applications, to reduce the number of unauthorised encampments and to directly address the low number of transit sites that currently exist - there are only an estimated 16 standalone transit sites within England.</p>

<p>Additional to the evaluation criteria, the assessment panel will also consider the locations of projects when making their final funding recommendations to ensure there is a fair disbursement of public funds geographically, this will also ensure there are a sufficient number of sites supported across England.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>Grant funding will be paid under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. The funded projects will be required to have had expenditure incurred or to be incurred during the financial year 2022/23. Funding is available for capital costs only and includes funding for land remediation.</p>

<p>Funding can be sought for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>developing a new transit site;</li>
  <li>refurbishing an existing transit site;</li>
  <li>new temporary stopping places;</li>
  <li>refurbishment, equipment, and facilities associated with existing temporary stopping places;</li>
  <li>new permanent pitch or plot provision;</li>
  <li>improvements to existing permanent sites (includes refurbishment and rebuild, provision of site infrastructure);</li>
  <li>acquisition of land for permanent pitch/plot provision; and</li>
  <li>funding for ancillary buildings on the site or public space, e.g., community buildings, play areas for children, stabling for horses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding can be provided for refurbishment and equipment for transit sites and temporary stopping places if there is a clear need and evidence that they have been used in the past and will be used in the future.</p>

<p>Local authorities can bid for funding for more than one transit site and /or temporary stopping site and /or permanent site. This can be in addition to funding for refurbishment of existing sites. A separate application should be completed for each site.</p>

<p>For new sites, or extensions to existing sites, the cost of additional land acquired can be included in the proposal as valued by an independent valuer. The site acquisition price should include any identified remedial costs.</p>

<p>Revenue costs associated with the management of the project and post build, such as ongoing management costs and upkeep of the site, will be the responsibility of the local authority.</p>

<p>Grant funding will be considered for up to 100% capital funding, however increased weighting will be given to applications which include a 10% contribution by the local authority.</p>

<p>Authorities are encouraged to bid for the minimum funding necessary to make the project viable.</p>

<p>Bids of up to £1 million are encouraged, so that we can seek a fair geographical disbursement of funding. Applications from local authorities wishing to bid for more than £1 million will be considered but these must be supported with a justification clearly setting out why the project cannot proceed with funding support of up to £1 million along with any costing information or evidence to support this.</p>

<p>Given that authorities are requested to apply for the minimum grant necessary to make the project viable, 100% of the grant requested will normally be paid to an authority. However, please note that the grant value requested is not guaranteed. We reserve the right to offer applicants a lesser value to that requested in the application.</p>

<p>Please note that applications cannot include other funding from DLUHC within the same financial year.</p>

<p>All applicants must also consider how they will deliver in line with subsidy control as per government guidance, as well as all other relevant legal obligations such as procurement.</p>

<h2>Section 4: Applications</h2>

<p>To apply for the Traveller Site Fund, please complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.communities.gov.uk/funding/30ada463/" rel="external">application form and Traveller Site Fund budget table</a>. The budget table is for local authorities to provide a full breakdown of capital costs and outline their project plan for delivery.</p>

<p>Please email a plan showing the location of the site and illustrative drawings of any proposed permanent buildings, clearly labelled with the Project Title (question 3.1 in the application form) to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:travellersitefund@levellingup.gov.uk">travellersitefund@levellingup.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>A separate application form must be completed for each bid submitted.</p>

<p>The bidding process will open on Sunday 20 March 2022. Completed applications must be received by <strong>midday</strong> on Monday 13 June 2022.</p>

<p>Please direct any queries relating to the fund and the application process to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:travellersitefund@levellingup.gov.uk">travellersitefund@levellingup.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.</strong></p>

<h3>Decision-making</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All applications will be scored using this framework and final decisions on funding will be made by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). Decisions on funding will ultimately be taken by DLUHC ministers, following advice from officials.</li>
  <li>All bids that pass the initial sift will be scored by DLUHC officials against the assessment criteria. Officials will provide ministers with a shortlist of bids which all meet a benchmark and are deemed fundable based on their scores against the assessment criteria.</li>
  <li>DLUHC ministers will make a decision on which of these projects from the shortlist will be funded. DLUHC ministers will exercise discretion on the following specific factors only, ensuring a:
    <ul>
      <li>balanced spread of projects across areas where need has been demonstrated</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Where projects are based in the constituency of a minister involved in decision-making, they will recuse themselves from the discussion and decision-making process and will be able to delegate to another minister of that department.</li>
  <li>Only local authority led bids will be accepted.</li>
  <li>In the event that the fund is oversubscribed, priority will be given to bids that will deliver new transit and temporary stopping sites in an area with a high amount of unmet need (based on the evidence in a recent local authority assessment of need). Priority will also be given to new site provision over refurbished provision.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assessment criteria</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/traveller-site-fund-202223-assessment-criteria-guidance">full assessment criteria for the fund can be found here</a>. In summary, assessors will look for:</p>

<p>1.	<strong>Strategic case</strong>: how it will meet an identified need for a new transit site, permanent site, temporary stopping place or refurbishment of existing provision in the area and how it will meet the fund’s wider strategic aims.</p>

<p>2.	<strong>Management case</strong>: the deliverability of the project within the financial year 2022/23, and that project delivery will be effectively managed.</p>

<p>3.	<strong>Site management and amenities</strong>: clear details of how the site will be managed to ensure its success and how the site and its amenities will support the wellbeing of traveller communities.</p>

<p>4.	<strong>Value for money</strong>: evidence that bids will offer value for money, both in terms of delivering the proposal and also the ongoing management of the site, to ensure it continues to provide value and meet the fund’s strategic objectives.</p>

<p>5.	<strong>Transit site prioritisation</strong>: priority will be given to bids that will deliver new transit sites and temporary stopping places in an area with a high amount of unmet need (based on the evidence in a recent local authority assessment of need). This is to directly address the low number of transit sites that currently exist and to reduce the number of unauthorised encampments.</p>

<p>To receive grant payments, applicants will be required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities where they commit to engage with monitoring and evaluation activities.</p>

<h2>Section 6: Monitoring and reporting</h2>

<p>We recognise that robust monitoring and evaluation is important for governance, accountability and understanding what works.</p>

<p>To ensure robust evidence is gathered and as part of the condition of funding, local authorities will be required to agree a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to submit: regular data; progress reports against key milestone dates in the project plan submitted with their application form; summary of key risks and mitigations; and an end of project report which includes a detailed breakdown of expenditure.</p>

<p>Local authorities will also be required to provide feedback on the difference the fund has made locally 3, 6 and 12 months after project completion.  These should include evidence of the monetised costs and benefits linked to the use of the fund.</p>

<p>This information will be a crucial element in informing the Department’s future work and funding priorities.  </p>

<p>A standardised template and guidance will be provided to support successful local authorities to demonstrate the impact of their project and delivery against their original business plan. </p>

<h2>Section 7: Public Sector Equality Duty</h2>

<p>As a public body, DLUHC is required to meet statutory equality duties set out in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010. This requires the department to pay due regard to the need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act 2010;</li>
  <li>advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not; and</li>
  <li>foster good relations between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.</li>
</ul>

<p>This duty also applies to local authorities and any other body who performs functions of a public nature. Local authorities should comply with the statutory duty and ensure that equality impacts are considered in accordance with section 149 Equality Act 2010.</p>

<p>The Department believes that the programme will have positive equality outcomes.</p>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p><strong>‘Transit site’</strong></p>

<p>A pitch on which a person is entitled to station a mobile home under the terms and agreement for a fixed period of up to 3 months.  Transit sites are permanent sites used to provide temporary accommodation for their residents. Lengths of stay can vary but are usually set at between 28 days and 3 months. The requirements for transit sites reflect the fact that they are not intended for use as a permanent base for any individual household.</p>

<p><strong>‘Travellers’</strong></p>

<p>Travellers means persons of the beneficiary as set out in the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites and the National Planning Policy Framework, which for the avoidance of doubt includes Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers, new age travellers and travelling show people. The word ‘traveller’ should be construed accordingly.</p>

<p>The fund is applicable to travellers that fall under either the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (PPTS) or the National Planning Policy Framework (the framework).</p>

<p><strong>‘Temporary stopping place’</strong></p>

<p>Pieces of land in temporary use as authorised short-term (less than 28 days) stopping places for all travelling communities. They may not require planning permission if they are in use for fewer than 28 days. The requirements for temporary stopping places reflect the fact that the site will only be used for a proportion of the year and that individual households will normally only stay on the site for a few days.</p>

<h2>Annex A: Site design standards</h2>

<h3>Site design standards</h3>

<p>We have carried out extensive research to understand what makes traveller sites successful. The following engagement and design standards, read in conjunction with the ‘Places we’re proud of’ guidance linked below, set out what we expect to see from a good-quality site proposal. Bids will be assessed against these standards.</p>

<p>In addition to the criteria set out below and relevant legislative requirements, including the Mobile Homes Act 1983 as amended, local authorities will need to take decisions on the design on a case-by-case basis, considering local circumstances such as the size, geographical area and other characteristics of the site and the particular needs of the prospective residents and their families.</p>

<p>The preferred site size for transit sites, permanent sites and temporary stopping places would be 10 pitches/plots or less. Funding will only be considered for sites that exceed 15 pitches in exceptional circumstances. This is based on feedback from stakeholders during recent roundtable discussions on the Planning White Paper as to what constitutes an appropriate site size.</p>

<p>The National Housing Policy Advisory Panel on Gypsy and Traveller Accommodation, supported by the National Housing Federation and Chartered Institute of Housing, recently published best practice guidance on site design and management: ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://issuu.com/rooftop1/docs/places_we_re_proud_of" rel="external">Places we’re proud of</a>’.</p>

<h3>Transit sites</h3>

<p>Transit sites should be developed and/or refurbished in accordance with existing planning policies, with particular regard made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the transit site will be managed to ensure their temporary use for up to 3 months, preventing the transit site being used on a permanent basis by a small number of residents, which then restricts future use for other families;</li>
  <li>affordability of daily / weekly pitch fees and additional costs and deposit;</li>
  <li>convenience and safety for site residents with hardstanding base and no gravel;</li>
  <li>visual and acoustic privacy – both for people living on the site and those living nearby;</li>
  <li>aesthetic compatibility with the local environment;</li>
  <li>proximity of the site - to be situated in a convenient location close to the local transport system and amenities such as schools, GPs, hospitals, and supermarkets;</li>
  <li>size of site - for a transit site to be easily managed the ideal number of pitches should be 10 or less.  We will not fund any sites that exceed 15 pitches.</li>
  <li>size of pitch – it is important to ensure that, wherever possible, each pitch is of a size sufficient to accommodate up to 2 touring caravans, 2 parking spaces and private amenities - which consist of 2 electrical hook-ups, a standpipe of drinking water and drainage;</li>
  <li>private amenities – site residents tend to prefer private amenities on each pitch including a toilet, wash basin and shower with hot and cold-water supply;</li>
  <li>depending on the degree of usage, consideration could be given to providing portable facilities on a transit site to meet these needs. 
Where transit sites are empty for lengthy periods there is a risk of vandalism to facilities, and it may be preferable for these to be removed until the site is reoccupied. In adopting this approach, it is sensible to ensure that permanent waste and water pipework is in place for facilities to be easily reinstalled. Two-bathroom units are preferable: one male and one female, containing 4 toilets and 4 showers with a family room at the end that is locked and private. A disabled unit with accessible shower and toilet;</li>
  <li>accommodation / office for a warden / resident manager – transit sites may present particular management challenges and depending on local circumstances and sufficient usage, provision for a resident site manager may be required to ensure the long-term viability of the transit site;</li>
  <li>community room with broadband, for example somewhere for children to do their homework or for local authority staff and partners to support residents with accessing health, education and employment;</li>
  <li>waste disposal – waste disposal for individual pitches on transit sites is recommended. Communal refuse disposal should be provided which is convenient (but away from pitches and associated dwellings on site), fenced off, robust and inconspicuous;</li>
  <li>children’s play area;</li>
  <li>grazing area for animals; and</li>
  <li>WIFI services for both site managers and residents of the transit site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Temporary stopping places</h3>

<p>Under this programme, local authorities will be eligible to bid for developing new temporary stopping places and/or the refurbishment of and providing equipment for existing temporary stopping places in accordance with existing planning policies and designations, with particular regard made to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the temporary stopping place will be managed to ensure the temporary use of these for up to 28 days, preventing the stopping place being used on a permanent basis by a small number of residents, which then restricts future use for other families;</li>
  <li>the costs of purchasing equipment such as portable toilets, standpipes, fencing and power generators;</li>
  <li>whether a charge will be levied to users of the stopping place;</li>

<h3>Site engagement</h3>

<p>Successful sites rely on good engagement with all sections of the local community. Bids should include details of any consultations that have taken place with the local community and relevant local agencies and any that are planned. Consultations may involve some or all the following groups, depending on the scale and type of work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local travellers and representative groups</li>
  <li>Current site residents within the local authority or families on unauthorised encampments to seek their views on whether the proposed site would be used, whether it is in an appropriate area, what facilities would need to be provided etc</li>
  <li>Local residents and businesses</li>
  <li>Education, planning, health, social services, and transport authorities</li>
  <li>Relevant local agencies such as police and fire services</li>
  <li>Neighbouring authorities within the expected catchment area</li>
  <li>Parish Councils, local MPs</li>
</ul>

<p>Please also include any relevant information on how the engagement work has helped to shape the project.</p>

<p>Please include, for refurbishments of existing sites, what support will be offered to residents whilst renovation work is carried out.</p>

<h3>How will the site be managed?</h3>

<p>Bids should set out the rent and management costs of the site and what the role of the site manager would be (both resident and non-resident) to ensure good and sustainable site management that provides safe and secure provision including where relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How the site manager will run and manage the site, including access, terms and conditions and any requirements residents will have to adhere to;</li>
  <li>How the running and management costs will be sustained throughout the lifetime of the site to keep it in good repair and well maintained and what will be put in place to prevent potential vandalism from residents who use the site and the settled community while it is not in use;</li>
  <li>How the site manager (resident and non-resident) will engage with residents and manage issues around traveller group and family compatibility, particularly when allocating places on the transit / temporary stopping sites;</li>
  <li>How anti-social behaviour (ASB) and public order issues from both the settled community and the residents of the sites will be dealt with, to prevent any community tensions arising and the peaceful occupation of the site;</li>
  <li>What advice and support will be provided to help residents access services, such as schools and hospitals? For example, a leaflet setting out location of supermarkets, petrol stations, schools, GP surgery, dentists, hospitals and directory of support provided by the local authority;</li>
  <li>How will the site manager work with traveller liaison officer to ensure children on sites are receiving a suitable education – including if children are home educated and need broadband or Wi-Fi and access at home or require school transport to local schools;</li>
  <li>How any welfare concerns for site residents, especially children, will be considered and addressed;</li>
  <li>For transit sites, whether the transit site can be booked in advance rather than using section 62 to direct travellers from unauthorised encampments on to the transit site.  How will the local authority publicise how travellers can apply or be directed to use the transit site and/or the stopping place.</li>
