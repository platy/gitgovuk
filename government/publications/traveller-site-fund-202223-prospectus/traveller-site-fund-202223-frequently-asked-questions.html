<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Is the Fund only open to applications for travellers covered by the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites definition?</h2>

<p>No, the fund is applicable to both travellers who have their needs assessed under the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (‘<abbr title="Planning Policy for Traveller Sites">PTTS</abbr>’) or the National Planning Policy Framework (‘<abbr title="National Planning Policy Framework">NPPF</abbr>’). Travellers means persons of the beneficiary as set out in the PPTS and the <abbr title="National Planning Policy Framework">NPPF</abbr>, which for the avoidance of doubt includes Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers, new age travellers, and travelling show people. The word ‘traveller’ should be construed accordingly.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus#glossary">View the glossary</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Can the fund be used for van dwellers?</h2>

<p>No, for the purposes of the fund, travellers mean persons of the beneficiary as set out in the PPTS and the <abbr title="National Planning Policy Framework">NPPF</abbr>, which for the avoidance of doubt includes Romany Gypsies, Irish Travellers, new age travellers, and travelling show people.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus#glossary">View the glossary</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Can the funding be used for bricks and mortar housing?</h2>

<p>Funding cannot be used for traditional bricks and mortar housing for travellers. The Affordable Housing Fund can be used for this purpose. Funding can however be used for permanent ancillary buildings (e.g. day rooms) built from bricks and mortar on sites.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> If we have secured capital funding from a separate government fund, can we combine this with funding from the Traveller Site Fund?</h2>

<p>Applications cannot include other funding from Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities within the same financial year.</p>

<p>The Traveller Site Fund cannot be used as match for any live current funding form the Affordable Homes Programme through Homes England or the GLA (Greater London Authority) in 2022/2023. If a local authority has received funding in previous financial years, then it may be feasible for the Traveller Site Fund to be used as additional funding depending on the works proposed.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Does a site have to be owned by a local authority to be eligible for the fund?</h2>

<p>A site is not required to be in a local authority’s ownership at the time an application is made if it will eventually be leased or owned by a local authority, Housing Association or Registered Social Landlord. In assessing applications received for funding, assessors will look for clear evidence of the deliverability of the project. View the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/traveller-site-fund-202223-assessment-criteria-guidance">assessment criteria guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Is the Traveller Site Fund available exclusively to local authorities, defined at local councils, or could Police and Crime Commissioners or parish councils apply to the fund?</h2>

<p>Local authorities can work with partners such as housing associations, voluntary sector organisations and community-based organisations (including traveller organisations) in the delivery and management of the sites. We encourage joint bids with neighbouring authorities and both upper and lower tier authorities, as well as local partners such as police and parish councils. The lead local authority will need to submit the application, be the lead partner and be accountable for the Section 31 grant.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Can a local authority apply for the Traveller Site Fund and contract a third party e.g. housing association to deliver and manage the site?</h2>

<p>All local authorities in England are eligible to bid for funding. Local authorities can work with partners such as housing associations, voluntary sector organisations and community-based organisations (including traveller organisations) in the delivery and management of the sites.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Will the scheme run 2023/24?</h2>

<p>The Traveller Site Fund is currently available for local authorities in England for the financial year 2022/23 only.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Can we refurbish a site that has more than 15 pitches?</h2>

<p>Funding will only be considered for sites that exceed 15 pitches. Where exceptional circumstances can be found, the fund can be used for the refurbishment of existing transit and permanent sites with over 15 pitches. Additional new pitches can be added to existing sites if you can demonstrate a clear need.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Can we build a new transit/permanent site that will have more than 15 pitches?</h2>

<p>For a permanent and transit site to be easily managed the ideal number of pitches should be 10 or less. Funding will only be considered for sites that exceed 15 pitches in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Will applications for refurbishment and permanent sites receive the 5% uplift?</h2>

<p>Permanent provision and refurbishment will not receive the 5% uplift. In the event that the fund is oversubscribed, priority will be given to bids that will deliver new transit and temporary stopping sites in an area with a high amount of unmet need (based on the evidence in a recent local authority assessment of need, if available, and/or local authority data and information). Priority will be given as part of the scoring assessment to new site provision over refurbished provision.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span> Can the funding be used to purchase land?</h2>

<p>Yes, funding can be used for the acquisition of land. For new sites, or extensions to existing sites, the cost of additional land acquired can be included in the proposal as valued by an independent valuer. The site acquisition price should include any identified remedial costs.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Do sites need planning permission in place before a bid can be made?</h2>

<p>Sites do not need to have obtained planning permission before a bid can be made. You should outline the current position in regard to obtaining planning permission in your application. This will, however, be a consideration when assessing bids for deliverability. View the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/traveller-site-fund-202223-assessment-criteria-guidance">assessment criteria guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> How detailed should any drawings/layouts be?</h2>

<p>We would expect to see a plan showing the location of the site and illustrative drawings of any proposed permanent buildings and any other key elements you wish to show, e.g., boundary treatments. Also see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus/traveller-site-fund-202223-prospectus#annex-a-site-design-standards">Annex A of the prospectus: site design standards</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Do you have an approved list of contractors?</h2>

<p>We do not have a list of approved contractors. We recommend that local authorities set out estimates and outline a breakdown of your costs in your application.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> How can we evidence need for a site?</h2>

<p>Local authorities should outline the challenges with current provision or lack of provision in your local authority area including, if relevant, collected data / information that sets out the impact, number, and costs of dealing with Unauthorised Encampments and Unauthorised Developments. We recommend including data from the local authority traveller needs assessment if available. Local authorities should describe the local impacts on services/the wider local community and how your project will meet the need for additional provision as well as how it will address the impacts on the wider community.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Can the funding be used to install external wall insulation/solar panels to amenity blocks on a traveller site?</h2>

<p>Yes, funding can be used to make improvements to existing sites (includes refurbishment and rebuild, provision of site infrastructure).</p>
