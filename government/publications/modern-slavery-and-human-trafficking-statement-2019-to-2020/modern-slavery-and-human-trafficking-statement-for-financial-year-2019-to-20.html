<p>The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and its group is committed to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in any part of our business or supply chain. It is absolutely the right thing to do and we aim to take sustained and concerted action against such acts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Organisation’s structure and business</h2>
<p>The NDA is a non-departmental public body formed under the Energy Act 2004 to oversee the decommissioning of the UK’s nuclear legacy. We are the ultimate parent of the NDA Group, with subsidiaries that undertake and support decommissioning and waste management in the UK, provide specialised transport services, as well as ancillary functions such as training and socio-economic services to our local areas. The NDA has offices located in London, Warrington, Cockermouth, and Whitehaven.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Our supply chains</h2>
<p>Our supply chain includes large multinational organisations, publicly owned bodies as well as a range of small and medium sized suppliers providing goods, services and works for the NDA.</p>

<p>To ensure all suppliers within our extended supply chain comply with our values, we have in place a [Supply Chain Charter.] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/799053/Supply_Chain_Charter_-_July_2017_update.pdf). This reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships, and to implementing and enforcing appropriate systems and controls.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Our policies on slavery and human trafficking</h2>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business.</p>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/799053/Supply_Chain_Charter_-_July_2017_update.pdf">Supply Chain Charter</a> sets out our expectations from the supply chain to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking. In addition, our Whistleblowing Policy provides a reporting method for our staff and others to alert us to any concerns they may have. This provides a second line of defence in assuring our compliance with modern slavery, and is managed by our Compliance team. This is being replaced with a new enhanced Speak Up Policy in 2021/22.</p>

<p>We require all our subsidiaries to make annual modern slavery and human trafficking statements demonstrating our collective “OneNDA” commitment to combatting modern slavery.
4. Screening processes for slavery and human trafficking</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Screening processes for slavery and human trafficking</h2>
<p>As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate modern slavery risk, we have required all of the NDA’s direct suppliers to self-certify their compliance with modern slavery and human trafficking legislation. We aim to implement further risk-based audits of the supply chain, as set out below.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Training</h2>
<p>We have historically provided training to key staff on modern slavery risks; however, we continue to look to implement a more robust training programme. In this period, we have mandated that all commercial staff working in the NDA Corporate Centre undertake ‘The Tackling Modern Slavery in the Supply Chain: PPE Case Study’ online course to improve awareness of modern slavery.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Further steps</h2>
<p>Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains, we intend to take the following further steps to combat modern slavery and human trafficking: -</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will roll-out further modern slavery awareness training to our Commercial function to ensure those responsible for awarding contracts are aware of modern slavery risks, this includes building the requirement into our induction process;</li>
  <li>We will launch our revised Modern Slavery Policy detailing our approach to managing modern slavery and human trafficking risk;</li>
  <li>We continue to review our relevant policies, including the Supply Chain Charter and Speak Up Policy to ensure they remain fit for purpose; and</li>
  <li>We will undertake risk-based auditing, reporting any findings back through the NDA Board.</li>
</ul>

<p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our modern slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2021. It was approved by the NDA Board on 29th September 2021.</p>
