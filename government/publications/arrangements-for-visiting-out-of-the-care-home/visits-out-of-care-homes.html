<p>This guidance applies to residential care homes, and care homes residents of all ages. There is separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supported-living-services-during-coronavirus-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-for-supported-living" class="govuk-link">guidance for supported living and extra care settings</a>.</p>

<p>The measures described in this guidance relate to visits where the resident leaves the care home premises. Visits with friends and family that take place in the care home garden or other outdoor spaces on the premises are described in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">care homes visiting guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key message</h3>

<p>Opportunities for care home residents to make visits out of the home are an important part of care home life.</p>

<p>Even as vaccine coverage increases, there are still risks involved in visits out. It’s important that care homes, residents, family and friends take steps to manage and mitigate these risks.</p>
</div>

<p>This guidance applies from 17 May 2021. It accompanies the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021" class="govuk-link">government roadmap to ease restrictions across England</a> and replaces all previous guidance on visits outside of the care home.</p>

<p>Spending time out of the care home has always been an important part of life for many people living in residential care, and residents leave their care home for a range of reasons. These might include to attend work or education, attend medical appointments and to spend time with friends and family.</p>

<p>For some residents, regular visits may be part of their care plan, such as accessing care and support in day services, participating in community groups and volunteering. For many residents of working age, this might include regular planned overnight visits to the nominated family home.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that much of this visiting out of the care home has had to stop stop in order to protect residents who are highly vulnerable to the virus and prevent it from spreading to other people that they live with.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021" class="govuk-link">roadmap out of lockdown</a> – guided by the data on the prevalence and transmission of COVID-19 – we want to enable care home residents to enjoy trips out of the care home, wherever it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>We recognise how important this is for residents’ health and wellbeing, their ability to remain at the heart of family and social networks, and, in some cases, to deliver the objectives of their care plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, spending time with others outside the care home will increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the resident and potentially to other residents and staff on their return. This is the case even as we see community infection rates dropping and vaccine coverage increasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This guidance sets out the approach that care homes should take to planning and supporting visits out of the home as safely as possible, where residents wish to make them.&nbsp;It explains the measures that should be taken – by the home, the resident and others taking part in the visit – to manage the risks that residents returning from visits bring infection back into the care home with them.</p>

<p>In some cases, where the risks involved are high and the visit cannot be avoided (for example, involving an overnight stay in a hospital), this will mean that a resident making a visit out of the care home should self-isolate for 14 days on their return (where the day of return is day zero).&nbsp;This is to ensure that, in the event they have unknowingly become infected while out of the home, they minimise the chances of passing that infection on to other residents and staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are certain types of activity where the risks are inherently lower and these should ordinarily be supported without the need for self-isolation on return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to spend time outdoors</li>
  <li>to take part in outdoor exercise not involving close contact with others</li>
</ul>

<p>All care home residents should be supported to leave the home, subject to carefully considered risk assessments, for the following activities without being advised to self-isolate for 14 days on their return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to go to work or take part in education or training</li>
  <li>for medical appointments such as GP appointments, excluding overnight stays in hospital</li>
  <li>to take part in other activities necessary to maintain an individual’s health and wellbeing (for example, going to a day centre or to a place of worship)</li>
</ul>

<p>All precautions relating to COVID-19 (including social distancing and those set out below) should be followed while out of the care home. Where residents are visiting out to somewhere with an existing testing regime – for example a workplace, day care centre or education setting – they should participate in the relevant testing regime for that organisation where possible. In addition, a specific risk assessment taking into account full vaccination status, levels of infection in the community, variants of concern in the community, and/or additional measures which may be required to protect care homes from infection though visits out to higher risk settings, should be carried out for all residents before any visit out takes place.</p>

<p>The guidance remains that residents who make a visit out other than in the circumstances set out above and where the risk of infection cannot be sufficiently mitigated should self-isolate for 14 days on return.</p>

<p>At this time, based on clinical advice, this means that care home residents should self-isolate for 14 days when they return from overnight stays. This remains under active review and it is our ambition that guidance on the need for self-isolation following overnight stays will be amended as soon as the data and evidence show it is safe.</p>

<p>Separate guidance is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes#section-2" class="govuk-link">planning visits that residents may need to make to a hospital or other healthcare setting</a>.</p>

<p>Care homes should always support visits out in exceptional circumstances, such as to visit a friend or relative at the end of their life.</p>

<p>When the data shows it is safe, the government wants to go further and support more visits to take place outside of the care home. Visits out will be kept under review over the coming weeks as the government looks carefully at the effectiveness of the vaccines for people living in care homes as well as levels of infection in the local community, and the impact of new variants of concern.</p>

<h2>Other steps to mitigate the risks around a visit out</h2>

<p>No visit out of a care home during a pandemic is without risk, but there are steps we can take to reduce those risks. To support safe visits out of care homes and to minimise the risk of transmission of infection to care home residents and other people they live with in the care home, the following measures should be considered for all visits out of care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>residents may be (but are not required to be) accompanied by:
    <ul>
      <li>a member of care home staff</li>
      <li>one or more of their named visitors, and/or</li>
      <li>their essential care provider (where applicable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>residents may meet other people but should maintain social distance from anyone who is not one of their named visitors, essential care providers, or care staff and, wherever possible, should avoid close physical contact with those who are supporting their visit to minimise the risk of infection</li>
  <li>care homes should discuss arrangements with residents, residents’ named visitors, or their essential care provider, in advance</li>
  <li>crowded places should be avoided</li>
  <li>visits to indoor spaces should normally be avoided (except, for example, for the use of toilet facilities), unless they are for work, education, medical appointments or where an individual assessment has determined the activity is necessary to maintaining an individual’s health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>visits should not involve the use of public transport</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a care home is situated in a local community with high, or rapidly rising, levels of infection, and/or where there is evidence of variants of concern or variants under investigation, care home managers should seek additional local advice from their local authority director of public health (<abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr>).</p>

<p>Where visits out are accompanied by a named visitor, visitors should follow their relevant testing regime and receive negative test results. For essential care givers, this is the same testing requirements as staff. For all other named visitors, this is a rapid lateral flow test taken on the day of the visit. Visitors within 90 days of a previous positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test do not need to test after they have completed the necessary self-isolation period, unless they become symptomatic again. If any visitor or any member of the visitor’s household has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">symptoms of COVID-19</a> or has tested positive, they should not proceed with the visit.</p>

<p>Where residents are visiting out to somewhere with an existing testing regime, for example a workplace, day care centre or education setting, they should participate in the relevant testing regime for that organisation where possible. Testing arrangements are outlined in more detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">guidance on care home visiting</a>.</p>

<p>Others involved in the visit should take steps leading up to the visit to minimise the risk to the care home resident and others in the care home, recognising that introducing COVID-19 to a care home puts all those who live and work there at risk. This includes following good infection control practice including social distancing, hand hygiene, wearing face coverings and avoiding crowded places.</p>

<h2>The role of the provider in supporting outward visiting</h2>

<p>Providers are best placed to define their overall policy for how outward visits are supported in the care home, in a way that takes into account the assessed needs of their residents and what is possible within the facilities and resources of the care home.</p>

<p>The makeup of the community in the home should be factored into these considerations, as people may have a range of needs, long-term conditions and other clinical vulnerabilities and levels of mobility. Providers should consider the potential risk that individuals leaving the home may pose to both residents and staff within the home (including any who may be particularly vulnerable) and the benefits to visiting out to recommend measures that should be used to mitigate the risk of infection before, during and after the resident leaves the home.</p>

<p>The local <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> and director of adult services (<abbr title="director of adult services">DASS</abbr>) have an important role in supporting care homes to ensure outward visiting can happen safely in their local area. This support should be based on the assumption that outward visiting should be possible unless there is evidence which suggests a more restrictive approach should be taken in a particular care home.</p>

<p>In particular, the <abbr title="director of public health">DPH</abbr> and <abbr title="director of adult services">DASS</abbr> should not recommend an approach across the whole of the local authority area that does not recognise variation between different areas with the local authority, and which does not take account of the different circumstances in individual homes and the need for any specific COVID-related infection control measures at a given time.</p>

<h2>Individual risk assessments</h2>

<p>Decisions about an individual resident’s visits outside of a care home should be taken by the provider on an individual-by-individual basis with the resident’s assessed needs and circumstances considered. The care home should balance the benefits of visits out of the care home against a consideration of the risks to others in the home, where necessary.</p>

<p>Regard should also be given to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ethical-framework-for-adult-social-care">ethical framework for adult social care</a>, and the wellbeing duty in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/section/1/enacted" class="govuk-link">section 1 of the Care Act 2014</a>, and all decisions should be taken in light of general legal obligations, such as those under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998, as applicable.</p>

<p>Social workers can help providers to meet these duties by providing advice in individual cases should that be required</p>

<p>Providers must consider the rights of residents who may lack the relevant mental capacity needed to make a decision about visits out of care homes. These people are protected by the empowering framework of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 and its safeguards. The government has published advice on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-looking-after-people-who-lack-mental-capacity/the-mental-capacity-act-2005-mca-and-deprivation-of-liberty-safeguards-dols-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-additional-guidancea">MCA and application of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS)</a> during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Before residents leave the home there should be a consideration of the factors set out below to help ensure that these trips and activities can happen safely and to determine whether a subsequent 14-day self-isolation is necessary.</p>

<p>Ahead of each person’s visit, providers should agree arrangements and risk mitigation with the resident (or a best interests decision if the person lacks capacity). This should be linked with the care plan. Things to be considered before a visit out should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the support needs that the resident may have during the visit, and whether the resident will need to be accompanied by a staff member, carer, family member or friend</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the vaccination status of the residents and the likely vaccination status of those in the setting they are visiting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the resident will be supported to follow good infection control practice including social distancing, hand hygiene and face coverings – and whether the resident’s needs are likely to impact their ability to do so</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transport for the visit, which should avoid exposing the resident to those outside the household they are visiting as much as possible. Public transport should be avoided but <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers" class="govuk-link">travelling in a family car or private taxi</a> would be acceptable</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that the resident and their family are involved in discussions throughout this process. If undertaking a visit out is not possible because of the risk to the individual and other residents and staff, care providers should communicate the reasons for this decision clearly to the resident and their family.</p>

<p>Where a resident intends to leave a care home to take part in activities described in an individual’s care plan, they should be subject to an assessment of risk, covering both:</p>

<ol>
  <li>infection risk</li>
  <li>the capability of the individual to return to activities in the care plan, particularly where the plan has not been updated recently</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important that the family or others who will be accompanying or hosting the resident have given careful thought to the inherent risks in taking their loved one out of the care home environment – in terms of infection risk for the resident, the family and potentially other residents in the care home. They will also need to think through how they will support the needs of that person during the visit.</p>

<p>Throughout the decision-making process, providers should share information with their staff so that responses to the residents and families are consistent and transparent. Alongside internal communication there should be clear public-facing communications of the provider’s approach to avoid any potential confusion, and helping to support relationships with families and avoid distress to residents or their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Where necessary, social workers can be approached by the care home, resident or family to support this conversation – in particular to help resolve any issues or concerns, and to ensure professional support and or oversight where required.</p>

<h2>In the event of an outbreak in the care home</h2>

<p>In the event of an outbreak in a care home, the home should immediately stop outward visiting. There may be local policy and outbreak management arrangements, which will be important to follow.</p>

<p>These restrictions should continue until the outbreak is confirmed as over, which will be at least 14 days after the last laboratory confirmed or clinically suspected cases were identified in a resident or member of staff in the home.</p>

<p>Recovery testing on all those who had previously tested negative should be carried out 14 days after the last positive test result. If all recovery testing shows negative results, outward visiting may be restarted but with the usual infection prevention and control measures and any enhancements required due to any risks identified following the recent outbreak.</p>

<p>Where there is an outbreak of a variant of concern, outward visiting will need to stop for at least 28 days after the last positive test in resident or care staff.</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak, all movements in and out of a setting should be minimised as far as possible and limited to exceptional circumstances only, such as to visit a friend or a relative at the end of their life.</p>
