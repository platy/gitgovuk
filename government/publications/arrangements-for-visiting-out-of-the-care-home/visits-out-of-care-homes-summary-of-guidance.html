<p>This summary guidance applies to residential care homes, and care home residents of all ages. It summarises the full guidance for visits out of care homes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Key message</h3>

<p>As part of the roadmap out of lockdown – guided by data on the prevalence and transmission of COVID-19 – we want to enable care home residents to enjoy trips out of care homes, wherever it is safe to do so.</p>
</div>

<h2>General visiting guidance – visits out</h2>

<p>The guidance for visits out of care homes sets out the approach that care homes should take to planning and supporting visits out of the home as safely as possible, where residents wish to make them.</p>

<p>In some cases, where the risks involved are high and the visit cannot be avoided (for example, involving an overnight stay in a hospital where there has been an outbreak), this will mean that a resident making a visit out of the care home should self-isolate for 14 days on their return (where the day of return is day zero).</p>

<p>There are certain types of activity where the risks are inherently lower and these should ordinarily be supported without the need for self-isolation on return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>to spend time outdoors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to take part in outdoor exercise not involving close contact with others</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All care home residents should be supported to leave the home, subject to carefully considered risk assessments, for the following activities without having to self-isolate for 14 days on their return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to go to work or take part in education or training</li>
  <li>for medical appointments such as GP and outpatient appointments, excluding overnight stays in hospital</li>
  <li>to take part in other activities necessary to maintaining an individual’s health and wellbeing (for example, going to a day centre or to a place of worship)</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents are not required to be accompanied when undertaking visits out of their care homes, but may be accompanied by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a member of care home staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one or more of their 5 nominated visitors, and/or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their essential care giver (where applicable)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Residents may meet other people but should maintain social distance from anyone who is not one of their nominated visitors, essential care providers, or care staff and, wherever possible, should avoid close physical contact with those who are supporting their visit to minimise the risk of infection.</p>

<p>All precautions relating to COVID-19 should be followed while out of the care home.</p>

<p>Where residents are visiting out to somewhere with an existing testing regime – for example, a workplace, day care centre or education setting – they should participate in the relevant testing regime for that organisation where possible.</p>

<p>A specific risk assessment taking into account full vaccination status levels of infection and/or variants of concern in the community and/or additional measures which may be required to protect care homes from infection though visits out to higher risk settings should be carried out for all residents before any visit out takes place.</p>

<p>The guidance remains that residents who make a visit out other than in the circumstances set out above and where the risk of infection cannot be sufficiently mitigated should self-isolate for 14 days on return. At this time, based on clinical advice, this means that care home residents should self-isolate for 14 days when they return from overnight stays. This remains under active review and it is our ambition that guidance on the need for self-isolation following overnight stays will be amended as soon as the data and evidence show it is safe.</p>

<p>Care homes should always support visits out in exceptional circumstances, such as to visit a friend or relative at the end of their life.</p>

<h2>Other steps to mitigate the risks around a visit out</h2>

<p>The following measures should be considered for all visits out of care homes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>care homes should discuss arrangements with residents, residents’ named visitors, or essential care provider, in advance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>crowded places should be avoided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visits to indoor spaces should normally be avoided (except, for example, for the use of toilet facilities), unless they are for work, education, medical appointments or where an individual assessment has determined the activity is necessary to maintaining an individual’s health and wellbeing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visits should not involve the use of public transport</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Individual risk assessments</h2>

<p>Decisions about an individual resident’s visits outside of a care home should be taken by the provider on an individual-by-individual basis with the resident’s assessed needs and circumstances considered. The care home should balance the benefits of visits out of the care home against a consideration of the risks to others in the home, where necessary.</p>

<h2>The role of the provider in supporting visiting</h2>

<p>Where a care home is situated in a local community with high or rapidly rising levels of infection, and/or where there is evidence of variants of concern or variants under investigation, care home managers should seek additional local advice from their local authority director of public health.</p>

<h2>If the care home makes a decision you disagree with</h2>

<p>If the care home makes a decision you disagree with, it would be best to speak to the care home manager and ask to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>You could ask about the risk assessment the care home has developed to decide its visitor policy.</p>

<p>You could consider asking the care home to do an individual risk assessment for your loved one.</p>

<p>If this does not help, you could consider contacting a social worker at your local authority. They may be able to discuss the situation with you and the care home manager to find a solution.</p>

<p>Sometimes there will be good reasons (like an outbreak of COVID-19 in the care home) why the home cannot offer the visiting you would like. But our guidance clearly says that the care home should not put blanket restrictions in place.</p>

<h2>In the event of an outbreak in the care home</h2>

<p>In the event of an outbreak, all movements out of a setting should be minimised as far as possible and limited to exceptional circumstances only, such as to visit a friend or a relative at the end of their life. These restrictions should continue until the outbreak is confirmed as over, which will be at least 14 days after the last laboratory confirmed or clinically suspected cases were identified in a resident or member of staff in the home.</p>
