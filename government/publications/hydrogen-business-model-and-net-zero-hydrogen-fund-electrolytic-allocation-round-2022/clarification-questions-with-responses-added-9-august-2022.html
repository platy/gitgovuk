<h2>Clarification questions, 20 September 2022</h2>

<p><strong>026. a. Can we apply for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> funding as one entity whilst establishing a new sister entity that will ultimately own the project (any potential contract would therefore awarded to the sister entity)? We intend to set out further details in our application but would like to confirm whether in principle these arrangements would be permitted?</strong></p>

<p>The funding application will be assessed, amongst other things, based on a financial assessment of the applicant company (the legal entity) and the applicant company’s ultimate parent, who will be expected to provide a parental undertaking guarantee in relation to any grant funding provided.</p>

<p>If either the applicant company or its ultimate parent were to change following the submission of the application, then further work would have to be undertaken by the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> funding application team to ensure that the conclusions reached regarding the financial assessment are still valid.</p>

<p>As a result, there should be no changes in the proposed structure between the submission of the application and the issuance of any potential final grant offer letter.</p>

<p><strong>b. The guidance for ‘3.10 Demonstrate access to finance’ suggests multiple pieces of evidence will be required despite the general rule for Section 3 being to reference a single piece of evidence. Could you please confirm that multiple sources of evidence are permitted for 3.10.</strong></p>

<p>Multiple evidence examples have been given in question 3.10 to provide a range of example evidence that could be provided. As set out across section 3 of the Project Application Form, Projects must reference the single most appropriate piece of evidence from your application submission to support your response to each eligibility criterion. Projects are able under the Deliverability evaluation criterion to submit additional mandatory and supporting financial related information.</p>

<p>During the evaluation process <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will perform additional checks on the credibility of the evidence provided and the robustness of any calculations involved. If Projects fail to provide sufficient evidence in respect of their satisfaction of the eligibility criteria, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>  will consider these to have failed the eligibility check and they will not progress further in the evaluation process.</p>

<p><strong>c. The Title for 4.1 states that “list of offtakers and other project partners contact information excluded from the word count” but there is no indication in the question guidance that this information is required. Could <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> please clarify if a full list of offtakers/partners and their contact information is expected in the answer?</strong></p>

<p>As part of their answer to question 4.1 in the Project Application Form, Projects are asked to provide an overview of their offtakers, including end use, the Project’s stage of securing an arrangement to supply and their development stage for preparing for conversion. Any contact information and the listing of offtakers or other project partners does not count towards the maximum 500-word limit for this answer as Projects are not assessed on this information.</p>

<p><strong>d. Could you please clarify the extent to which the above requirements are different or overlapping if the electricity used to produce hydrogen is generated from biomass off-site, including mixed feedstocks (i.e. x% biogenic, y% non-biogenic) , and sourced via a <abbr title="power purchase agreement">PPA</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>The same evidence requirements apply in this case, where the electricity is generated from a mixed biomass feedstock off-site and sourced via a <abbr title="power purchase agreement">PPA</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provided that the technical requirements around energy attribute information, low carbon electricity generation attributes and temporal correlation can be satisfied (as per Figure 3 in Annex A of the standard guidance document), the emissions intensity of the off-site generation asset can be reflected in real time</li>
  <li>the emissions intensity of electricity source should include the upstream emissions associated with electricity generation. Where mixed feedstocks are used, electricity generation emissions would have to be calculated separately for each feedstock, split at least according to the biogenic and non-biogenic fractions (and further as necessary e.g. if multiple types of biogenic feedstock are used), to feed into separate calculations for discrete consignments of hydrogen. Overall, the emissions relating to each consignment (noting that discrete consignments may then be averaged), alongside all other in-scope emission sources, would need to fall below the standard threshold. To calculate emissions for a project of this nature, using the full version of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1092813/BEIS_UK_HEC_V2.3_ELECTROLYSIS.xlsx" rel="external">the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator</a> is recommended</li>
  <li>the biogenic portion would also need to comply with the non-<abbr title="greenhouse gas">GHG</abbr> criteria in the standard, as laid out in Annexes C &amp; D of the guidance document. If the mixed feedstock is a non-agricultural waste or residue, it is unlikely that these additional criteria would apply</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>029. Page 47 of the guidance suggests that projects need to have a minimum of 75% offtake agreed to be eligible but to score a minimum of 4 in the deliverability criteria an offtake of 50% or more will qualify for a medium score (5-6). Please can you confirm the minimum offtake % for eligibility.</strong></p>

<p>Under the Deliverability evaluation criterion, Projects are scored against government’s confidence that the project has commercial and technical arrangements in place with viable off-takers for most (75% or above) of their hydrogen volumes. This is not a pass/fail eligibility criterion like those set out in section 3 of the Application Guidance document, although Projects must meet the minimum score threshold of 4 out of 10 to be considered for the Agreeing an Offer stage.</p>

<p>A project that demonstrates evidence of commercial and technical arrangements with offtakers for at least 50% of their hydrogen volumes, and confidence that those offtakers are commercially and technically viable and align with the electricity supply and storage arrangements can, at a maximum, score a 6 out of 10 for Deliverability if other score descriptors have been met. Projects must meet the minimum score threshold of 4 out of 10 and will be removed from further evaluation against other criteria if this threshold is not met. For a Project to score at least a 4 out of 10 there must be some confidence that proposed offtakers for 50% or above of hydrogen volumes are commercially or technically viable and other score descriptors are met, this would be the minimum offtake percentage a project must demonstrate.</p>

<p><strong>030. It would also be helpful to know what offtake structures are eligible. Specifically, if a project sells hydrogen to a mobility refuelling network provider and that provider resells the hydrogen to the mobility end user, would that fail the risk taking intermediary criteria? The guidance appears to indicate that would be case on the basis of a risk taking intermediary being “defined as a person that purchases hydrogen for the purpose of resale”. However, it’s not clear whether you had mobility in mind when you drafted this criteria or whether it’s specific to other offtakers.</strong></p>

<p>Volumes sold to risk-taking intermediaries are not eligible for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support. The definition of risk-taking intermediaries applies to all sectors, including transport. Volumes sold to risk-taking intermediaries operating in the transport sector may however be eligible for <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support.</p>

<p><strong>031. DfT confirmed there is no restriction within the ZEBRA grant terms and conditions on using other public funding as part of the scheme, such as a local authority investing its own funds in the project outputs. However DfT suggested we should clarify the position with yourselves regarding the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund to ensure there is no restriction within this on an ‘offtaker’ (in this case the bus operator) already being in receipt of grant funding.</strong></p>

<p>The Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (<abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>) will provide capital expenditure for new hydrogen production, alongside operational support from the Hydrogen Business Model.&nbsp; Projects cannot receive government support from multiple sources (i.e. from both <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> and IETF) for the same eligible costs and will need to comply with any relevant subsidy control requirements. Any subsidy received previously or together with the support provided through the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> will need to be declared and the applicant would need to ensure that the funding schemes do not provide support for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>032. a. Just to confirm the Strike Price will be designed to include:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> + returns on capital</strong><br>
<strong>- <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr></strong><br>
<strong>- Margin etc</strong></p>

<p>The strike price will include <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> for the facility, as well as an appropriate level of &nbsp;return on the capital invested in the project. Hydrogen business model support may also include capex (not <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr>) for small scale transport infrastructure and <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> for small-scale storage. Support will be assessed on a project-by-project basis taking into account several factors, including necessity, affordability and value for money. More detail can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067365/indicative-heads-of-terms-for-the-low-carbon-hydrogen-business-model.pdf" rel="external">hydrogen business model indicative heads of terms</a> (noting that they are preliminary and indicative only and the provisions set out therein are subject to further consideration and development by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>).</p>

<p><strong>b. Alongside that a project can also apply for <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> (via <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>) support as well. The value of this grant would then need to be adequately reflected in the submitted Strike Price?</strong></p>

<p>The offer to Projects will include both Strike Price and, where agreed, a <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> grant amount. As the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> will only incorporate the &nbsp;<abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> invested by the project and which has not been funded by the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> grant. The value for money assessment of submissions will take into consideration the subsidy amounts from both the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> and the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support schemes where relevant. More detail can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1092369/hbm-nzhf-electrolytic-round-application-guidance.pdf" rel="external">Electrolytic Allocation Application Guidance document.</a></p>

<h2>Clarification questions, 6 September 2022</h2>

<p><strong>012. What is Annex G and how can we access it? It is mentioned on page 7 of the project application form in Table 1 but there is no annex G on the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> website. Should Annex G actually refer to the <abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> guidelines in Appendix A of the Application Guidance?</strong></p>

<p>A correction has been made to the Project Application Form, where the previously labelled Annex G now refers to Appendix A in the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>013. We note in Section 1.5 of the Application Guidance Document that the <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> date is given as ‘3 months from award of contracts’.  We also note that the timetable in Section 1.5 is indicative.  Please could you clarify if a project achieves <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> later than the 3 months from award of contract, for instance, in January 2024 and can attain the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by December 2025 - is this project eligible?  Would there be any detriment to a project that achieves <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> six months from award of contract yet can still attain <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by December 2025?</strong></p>

<p>A credible plan will need to be provided to demonstrate a <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by end of 2025. There is an expectation that projects should take <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> 3 months from award of contract. Shortlisted Projects will engage with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> on a variety of financial, legal, technical and commercial issues such as progress according to the project timeline submitted at application stage, and discussing any issues or concerns highlighted during the assessments.</p>

<p>The scope of this engagement will be confirmed as part of the invitation letter to the Agreeing an Offer Stage. It should also be noted that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is committed to future allocation rounds, the details of which will be announced in due course.</p>

<p>As per section 3.2 of the Application Guidance document, at the eligibility stage, Projects will be asked to provide a target <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr>. The Project Schedule, including <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr>, and the robustness of the information provided to support it will be assessed further during the evaluation stage.</p>

<p>As per section 3.2 of the Application Guidance document, it is also important to note that the December 2025 <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> date is intended as a backstop date; having an earlier <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> could count favourably towards the project at the evaluation stage.</p>

<p><strong>014. a. The term ‘minimum production capacity’, discussed in section 3.8 of the document, refers to the internal energy of hydrogen, on <abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr> basis, and the capability of the plant to produce hydrogen at this rate.</strong></p>

<p>The electrolytic allocation round specifies a minimum production capacity of 5MW, which refers to the internal energy of the hydrogen produced.</p>

<p><strong>b. The actual production rate will depend on offtake quantities and may be below the minimum production capacity at certain times.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the minimum production capacity of 5MW output is not a requirement for all times - the condition is that the electrolyser should have the capacity to output at 5MW.</p>

<p><strong>015. a. Are all the metrics used for the electrolytic allocation round presented on a MWe (input of electricity) or MW(<abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr>) meaning hydrogen output? For example, when you say a target of 250 MW in the 2023 allocation, is it referring to MWe or MW(<abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr>), same for the minimum capacity to apply to the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> electrolytic allocation.</strong></p>

<p>The metrics refer to hydrogen output. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) basis. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>b. All the available applications are targeting projects with <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> 2025. I was wondering if <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> calls in 2023 will target projects with later online dates. Or what are the options for <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> funding for projects pretending to come online later than 2025.</strong></p>

<p>As per section 1.5 of the Application Guidance document, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is aiming to open a similar process to this Electrolytic Allocation Round in 2023, for contract award in 2024, and aim to have up to 1GW of electrolytic hydrogen in construction or operational by end of 2025 via these two allocation rounds. Policy is currently being developed for next year’s round and the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> for next year’s round is yet to be decided and we will update the sector on this in due course.</p>

<p><strong>016. a. Can you provide more clarity on the definition of the 75% offtake requirement? Is the 75% in reference to the nominal hydrogen production capacity of the electrolyser (i.e. assuming 100% load factor), or the amount of hydrogen that is expected to be produced? We consider that requiring 75% of nominal production will limit the ability of electrolysers to operate in a flexible manner to use intermittent renewable power and support grid balancing.</strong></p>

<p>The 75% refers to the amount of hydrogen that is expected to be produced.</p>

<p>A Projects’ Deliverability score will be based on their performance against three key factors, including <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ confidence that the project has commercial and technical arrangements in place with viable off-takers for most (75% or above) of their hydrogen volumes.</p>

<p>For example, for a 10MW project that intends to produce 40GWh of hydrogen per year, 75% of the hydrogen volumes would represent 30GWh of hydrogen per year.</p>

<p><strong>b. Will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> allow applicants to adjust <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> support figures (both intensity level up to 20% and total capex figure) during bilateral negotiations, or will the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> support requested in the application be fixed and non-negotiable?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will allow applicants to adjust <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> support figures through the Agreeing an Offer Stage. After the evaluation of submissions and shortlisting, selected projects will enter a process to agree an offer, which will involve engagement with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to agree a <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> grant through the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>. The process of agreeing a <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> grant will be iterative. Projects should note that any decision to award support will only be made subject to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> being comfortable with the application of subsidy control requirements, any balance sheet implications, and that the project represents value for money and is deliverable. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will need to ensure that any <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> award is necessary and proportionate in accordance with subsidy control principles.</p>

<p>As per section 1.6 of the Application Guidance document, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may discontinue the application process with a particular Project where the Project seeks to renegotiate elements of its Submission which would mean that it no longer satisfies <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ eligibility criteria, or the Project seeks to renegotiate elements of its Submission which would have an adverse effect on the score awarded to the submission at any stage of this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>c. Can project size and off-taker detail be adjusted following submission (i.e. during contract negotiation)?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may allow certain elements of a Project’s submission to be changed during the Agreeing an Offer stage, subject to this not having adverse effect on the score awarded to the submission, or on project eligibility, at any stage of this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>017. a. As currently drafted, the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> heads of terms state that the Strike Price for hydrogen production will be indexed in accordance with CPI. In order to access lowest cost finance to deliver the project and hence deliver best possible <abbr title="value for money">VfM</abbr> to the tax/bill payer, this indexation model requires a fixed power price for the duration of the contract. However, in today’s environment of historically high gas and wholesale electricity prices, power prices available on long term fixed contracts are also very high with an approximate three-fold increase since the start of 2022 even though forecasts going forward anticipate a reduction back to ‘normal’ pricing in the future.  Is there scope for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to consider indexing the Strike Price with the wholesale electricity price rather than CPI to ensure that advantage can be taken of cheaper off-peak power as additional renewable assets are developed and the geopolitical situation stabilises?  Are applicants allowed to update electricity pricing used in <abbr title="levelised cost of hydrogen">LCOH</abbr> calculation following application submission?</strong></p>

<p>Hydrogen produced by an electrolyser is only as low carbon as the electricity used and therefore <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> is seeking to incentivise electrolysers to run at times when they can access low carbon electricity. The Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard (<abbr title="low carbon hydrogen standard">LCHS</abbr>) incentivises electrolysers to target running at times of high supply of renewable electricity. The minded-to position set out in the indicative Heads of Terms for the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement, in respect of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> strike price indexation approach to the electricity cost, complements this approach by encouraging producers to use price management mechanisms (e.g. Power Purchase Agreements) to purchase this low carbon electricity, by exposing producers to electricity market price signals, and, in doing so, reduce the impact on the decarbonisation of the electricity grid. We aim to finalise the business model in 2022.</p>

<p>As per section 4.2.3 of the Application guidance, scores for the cost criterion will be assigned on the basis of a competitive ranking, with projects with a lower <abbr title="levelised cost of hydrogen">LCOH</abbr> scoring more highly. Scores will be allocated on a relative basis so that the score reflects the cost-effectiveness of a project relative to other applicants.</p>

<p>As per section 5.1 of the Application guidance, after the evaluation of submissions and shortlisting, selected projects will enter a process to agree an offer, which will include due diligence, a value for money assessment, and engagement with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> with the aim to agree an offer of support.</p>

<p>Shortlisted Projects will engage with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> on a variety of financial, legal, technical and commercial issues. In particular, shortlisted Projects will be expected to be able to share new information across a wide range of issues, including the management of risk; and to respond to requests for information from advisers as due diligence and value for money assessment commences.</p>

<p>Projects will be expected to provide <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> with updated information on the project, including costs.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may discontinue the application process with a particular Project where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Project seeks to renegotiate elements of its Submission which would mean that it no longer satisfies <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ eligibility criteria; or</li>
  <li>the Project seeks to renegotiate elements of its Submission which would have an adverse effect on the score awarded to the submission at any stage of this Electrolytic Allocation Round; or</li>
  <li>the Project does not comply or is not able to demonstrate during the Agreeing an Offer stage, that it will be able to comply with the plans set out in its Submission and/or under any of the evaluation criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b. When calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen at the application stage, will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> consider using fixed reference pricing for electricity across all projects to allow an accurate comparison of the merits of each project?  This would also reduce the risk of ‘cross-subsidy’ from owners of large-scale renewable assets that are already supported by levy-based government funding.</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will use the information and evidence submitted by applicants within and alongside the cost template when calculating the <abbr title="levelised cost of hydrogen">LCOH</abbr>, including the expected electricity costs. Electricity costs are a significant determinant of the <abbr title="levelised cost of hydrogen">LCOH</abbr>, and therefore the ability to access affordable electricity is an important determinant of both the viability and the cost-effectiveness of a project. Using the same electricity price for all projects is therefore not considered a viable way of assessing this criterion.</p>

<p>As set out in section 4.2.3 of the Application Guidance document <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will also assess the robustness of the cost estimates provided by applicants in the cost template, including their estimated electricity costs. Where projects submit cost data (including on electricity costs) that is not considered credible, their score for the cost criterion will be adjusted to account for this. Projects are therefore encouraged to provide as accurate and robust information as possible, as the credibility of the figures provided and the quality of supporting evidence will affect the score.</p>

<p><strong>018. a. How drastically can a project change from <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> to final submission, and would material changes to the project cause a project to become ineligible?</strong></p>

<p>Further information on the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> process can be found on page 16 of the Application Guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants are asked to confirm in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> that to the best of their knowledge they meet the mandatory eligibility criteria. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may provide feedback if it appears your Project is unlikely to meet the criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> answers are considered as indicative only and not as firm responses. Projects will not be prevented from making a full application based on the information provided in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr>.</p>

<p>The final submission which will be due by 12 October will require you to provide supporting evidence to prove you meet the eligibility criteria. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria and the minimum deliverability score will continue to the evaluation stage where they will be assessed against a set of defined evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may allow certain elements of a Project’s submission to be changed during the Agreeing an Offer stage, subject to this not having adverse effect on the score awarded to the submission, or on project eligibility, at any stage of this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>b. If a project is successful in securing funding/<abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> contract through this round of funding, would the contract accommodate the scale up of an electrolyser (e.g., from 30MW to 80MW)? If not, would it be possible to secure further funding for the scale up?</strong></p>

<p>As detailed in the government response to the consultation on a low carbon hydrogen business model, any increase in volume produced above any defined level through a new plant or a new module will not be subsidised under the existing contract, including new modules/units being added to an <abbr title="advanced thermal recycling">ATR</abbr> or <abbr title="small modular reactor">SMR</abbr> plant and new electrolyser modules being added to electrolytic facilities. We believe that allowing contract capacity to be increased through a new plant may not represent value for money to <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and should be subject to open and fair competition with new production projects in future rounds of contract allocation.</p>

<p>We are considering the case for producers to increase the volume produced within an existing plant above any level defined in their contract. We are carrying out further work to understand how the different hydrogen production technologies are able to increase production capacity, including whether capital is required or not. This information will be considered alongside the design principles outlined in the consultation and related aspects of the payment mechanism, including the sliding scale of volume support. This will enable us to progress to a minded to position on whether the contract should support producers to scale up production volumes at the plant above any level defined in the contract and, if so, by how much and what level of subsidy should be payable.</p>

<p><strong>c. If a project is unsuccessful in securing a contract through this round of funding, can a resubmission be made in the upcoming round?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, a resubmission can be made for future rounds. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ assumption is that because criteria might change, a new application will be required for Projects that are unsuccessful in the 2022 Electrolytic Allocation Round. This will be kept under review.</p>

<p><strong>d. How will the reference price be calculated in the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> contract? Will this be a fixed price based on <abbr title="natural gas">NG</abbr> or will it vary by contract and project?</strong></p>

<p>As per page 7 of the Indicative Heads of Terms, the ‘reference price’ (expressed in £ per MWh (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>)) is intended to represent the market price received by the producer for low carbon hydrogen. For initial projects, this will be the higher of the producer’s achieved sales price and the price floor (which will be the lower of the natural gas price and the strike price).</p>

<p>The reference price will act as the appropriate proxy in the absence of an observable hydrogen market price (low carbon or otherwise) and to encourage the development of a market benchmark as the hydrogen market develops. Please note that the indicative Heads of Terms do not constitute definitive drafting of the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement’s terms and we expect to finalise the Hydrogen Business Model later this year.</p>

<p>For further information on how the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> will work in practice, please refer to the government response to the consultation on a low carbon hydrogen business model and the Indicative Heads of Terms document.</p>

<p><strong>e. The eligibility criteria states <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by 31.12.25 whereas Ministers and <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> communications regularly say “in construction or operation by 2025”. There was considerable industry feedback that this <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> target is unrealistic. Could <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> reconsider the eligibility criteria on deliverability to ‘reserve the right’ to consider projects that have secured <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> and are physically in construction in 2025?</strong></p>

<p>As per page 11 of the Market Engagement Response, we recognise the concerns expressed by respondents on meeting the ‘<abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> of end of 2025’ criterion due to risk of delay. We have kept this as an eligibility criterion for the first allocation round to align with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ aims around hydrogen deployment by 2025 and to kickstart the market (noting as well that contracts awarded in the planned second round will mean a number of additional projects will be under construction in 2025). Under this criterion, we will require projects to demonstrate they are able to be operational no later than the end of December 2025. However, we have added in the Application Guidance Document that meeting the ‘<abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by end of 2025’ criterion is dependent on the signing of contracts from July 2023. The actual operational date of each project will be dependent on many factors, some of which may be outside of the party’s control. For example, if signing of contracts is delayed beyond July 2023 due to reasons outside of the applicant’s control, due to delays to the agreeing an offer process, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> reserves the right to allow the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> to be extended upon receiving the Applicant’s request. We will further test the projects’ deliverability at evaluation stage.</p>

<p><strong>f. Can <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> confirm the proposed <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> eligibility date for the proposed 2023 Strand 3 allocation round will be 31 December 2026?</strong></p>

<p>The <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> and general timelines for the 2023 Joint Allocation Round are yet to be confirmed. Further details will be shared in due course.</p>

<p><strong>g. Based on the industry’s response to the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> 2025 being infeasible, will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> consider revising the eligibility criteria and extending the application cut-off date?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will not be revising the eligibility criteria and does not expect to extend the application cut-off date. However, as per section 1.5 of the Application guidance, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> reserves the right to alter the indicative timelines for the 2022 Electrolytic Allocation Round at any stage in the process. Projects that are unable to meet the eligibility criterion of <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by end of 2025 can apply for future rounds, the details of which will be announced in due course.</p>

<p><strong>019. a. In Annex A of the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, it is stated that demonstration of exclusive ownership of the attributes of the low carbon electricity is required. We are asking if there is any requirement on the geographic correlation of the electricity generator and the electrolyser, e.g., they must be in the same bidding zone?</strong></p>

<p>For all electricity input being claimed as low carbon and receiving the <abbr title="greenhouse gas">GHG</abbr> intensity of a specific generation asset, all 3 technical requirements set out in Annex A of the guidance document would need to be met; namely, temporal correlation (matching generation of the specific asset(s) and electrolyser consumption per 30 minutes), contractual links (a <abbr title="power purchase agreement">PPA</abbr> linking to that generation asset), and energy attribute information to cover the amount of electricity used (e.g. a <abbr title="Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin">REGO</abbr>). We have not specified requirements around electricity sourced from outside of the UK in the <abbr title="low carbon hydrogen standard">LCHS</abbr>. We expect to provide further detail on this in relevant documentation, for example through the final Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement contract.</p>

<p><strong>b. The Annex lists <abbr title="Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin">REGOs</abbr> as an example of evidence, but doesn’t clearly mention <abbr title="Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin">REGOs</abbr> as the only possible evidence. <abbr title="Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin">REGOs</abbr> are only available in the UK. Would it be considered compliant with the Standard to use low carbon electricity procured through a virtual <abbr title="power purchase agreement">PPA</abbr> from another country if evidence can be provided through a Guarantee of Origin (GoO) used in EU member states in addition to evidence for temporal correlation?</strong></p>

<p>As above, we expect to provide further detail on electricity sourced from outside the UK in relevant documentation, for example final Business Model Contracts.</p>

<p><strong>020. Please could you clarify the referencing methodology? How do the evidence table headings in the Project Application Form correlate with the reference number and document title in annex F?</strong></p>

<p>Please follow the filename format detail within Annex F. Where a document is supporting more than one answer, please use the primary question number that the document is supporting within the file name and use Annex F to clearly mark each question the single document is also supporting. The document must be referenced within all answers within the Project Application Form which it is supporting. It is not necessary to upload the same file twice with a different question number.</p>

<p><strong>021. We note that MW ratings for electrolytic hydrogen projects typically refer to the electrolyser rating or the input power to the project (Scenarios 3 &amp; 4 below).</strong></p>

<p><strong>The <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> requirement can be interpreted as the following:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. 5MW average hydrogen production over the course of a year<br>- This is a very onerous requirement and is unlikely to be met by the majority of green hydrogen projects, and could require up to 25 MW of rated electrolyser capacity</strong>*</p>

<p><strong>2. 5MW peak hydrogen production output<br>- This is an onerous requirement and would exclude a significant number of green hydrogen projects, and could require up to 9 MW of rated electrolyser capacity</strong>*</p>

<p><strong>3. 5MW peak electrolyser stack/module rating (‘nameplate capacity’)<br>- This is a realistically achievable requirement, and would require 5 MW of rated electrolyser capacity</strong></p>

<p><strong>4. 5MW input power to site boundary<br>- This is a realistically achievable requirement, and would require ~4.5MW of rated electrolyser capacity</strong></p>

<p>*dependent on electrolyser capacity factor and heating value basis (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>/<abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr>)</p>

<p><strong>Could you please clarify the following:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Which of the above (1 to 4) scenarios relates to the ‘Minimum hydrogen production capacity of 5 MW’?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. If based on actual hydrogen production (average or peak), confirm whether <abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr>-basis or <abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>-basis should be used?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> has set a minimum production capacity of 5 MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) basis. This is a “peak” requirement: i.e. the hydrogen production plant must be capable of outputting 5 MW (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) of hydrogen (equal to 0.035 kg/s) but is not required to achieve this on an average basis. This corresponds to scenario (2) above. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>022. a. Will an entity that is rolling out vehicle refuelling stations to serve future retail customers for hydrogen as a fuel for road transport be treated as an eligible offtaker, or will they be seen by you as ‘Risk Taking Intermediary’?</strong></p>

<p>Volumes sold to risk-taking intermediaries are not eligible for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support. A risk-taking intermediary is defined as a person that purchases hydrogen for the purpose of resale. The definition of risk-taking intermediaries applies to all sectors, including transport. Volumes sold to risk-taking intermediaries operating in the transport sector may however be eligible for <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support.</p>

<p><strong>b. If the answer to 1 is ‘Risk Taking Intermediary’, what would said offtaker have to demonstrate to be treated as an eligible offtaker?</strong></p>

<p>An offtaker that is purchasing hydrogen with the intention of resale will be assessed to be a risk-taking intermediary in this 2022 Electrolytic Allocation Round. Once deemed a risk-taking intermediary, the offtaker will be declared as an ineligible offtaker. For this offtaker to be declared as an eligible offtaker there would need to be evidence provided that the offtaker does not contravene <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ definition of a risk-taking intermediary.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will consider the need to review the position on risk-taking intermediaries in future, both for existing contracts and future allocation rounds. For example, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ concern around monitoring sales via risk-taking intermediaries to end users could be addressed through a future low carbon hydrogen certification scheme (depending on final scheme design).</p>

<p><strong>c. You helpfully clarified on the webinar that as a producer of low carbon hydrogen, I will not be able to benefit from both the hydrogen contract for difference AND value from <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr>. If I sell my hydrogen to a third party offtaker at a price subsidised by the contract for difference, will that offtaker be able to benefit from the value of <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>No, a third-party offtaker who receives <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>-subsidised hydrogen would not be able to receive the benefit of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (<abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr>) for the same consignment of hydrogen. The third-party offtaker in this case cannot receive <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support and RTFC support as in order to receive RTFC support it would have to be selling the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>-subsidised hydrogen that it is purchasing, making it an ineligible offtaker. This is because volumes sold to risk-taking intermediaries are not eligible for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support. A risk-taking intermediary is defined as a person that purchases hydrogen for the purpose of resale.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> recognises that some projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (<abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>). Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, producers in receipt of <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support will be allowed to participate in the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>, subject to meeting the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> and <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and an enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>d. Please clarify the ambiguity in Section 1.1 of the guidance on pages 12 and 13:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More specifically, and as set out in the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> indicative Heads of Terms, this could include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr>, but not <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr>, costs associated with small-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, and</li>
    <li>the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> costs associated with small-scale storage infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Then in the paragraph that follows: “<abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> costs for storage and transport are not included within scope of this <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> funding”</strong></p>

<p>The primary focus of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> and <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> is to promote the production of cost-competitive low carbon hydrogen. Therefore, we intend to focus any support that is delivered through both schemes on hydrogen production.</p>

<p>We recognise however that an absence of transport and storage infrastructure could create a barrier to the growth of the nascent hydrogen economy. We will therefore adopt a pragmatic approach which will enable certain transport and storage infrastructure costs to be supported through the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, agreed on a case-by-case basis and subject to value for money. We believe that, while it may be necessary to allow <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> associated with transport infrastructure to be recovered through the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> relating to transport should be left to producers to manage with their end users. This will incentivise producers to design efficient transport approaches and see end users facing transport costs on top of fuel costs as they do currently. Both <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> costs for storage will be eligible for recovery under the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> costs for storage and transport are not included within the scope of this <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> Strand 3 funding. Under Strand 1 of the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>, where appropriate, support may be provided for <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> costs for associated on-site transport and storage (T&amp;S) infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>e. Relevant to the text in question 4, what is the definition of ‘small-scale’?</strong></p>

<p>We are proposing to adopt a pragmatic approach in the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> to supporting hydrogen transport and storage costs. We will assess whether to support these costs by taking a number of factors into account, including necessity, affordability and value for money.</p>

<p><strong>023. a. In Annex E, demand tab – How should a project account for demand if the low-carbon hydrogen is being used as feedstock to produce a new, low carbon fuel (e.g., methanol)?</strong></p>

<p>The demand tab should be completed taking into consideration the end use of the methanol.</p>

<p>1. Where there is an existing methanol synthesis plant and the hydrogen used is displacing the feedstock to the plant, the displaced fuel should be whatever fuel is currently used to produce the methanol.</p>

<p>2. Where the hydrogen will be the feedstock to a new methanol synthesis plant, the project could compare to a reasonable counterfactual, which in this case would be the amount of natural gas that would produce the same amount of methanol.</p>

<p><strong>b. Noting that there is no <abbr title="non disclosure agreement">NDA</abbr> to be signed for this competition, will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> seek to publish any of the information we provide as part of our submission?</strong></p>

<p>It is expected that details of support offered for Projects, with the exception of commercially sensitive information, may be published following the completion of the Agreeing an Offer Stage and awards.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may also share information provided by Projects (including information within the Submissions or EOIs) with other parts of government for the purposes of policy development and facilitating coordination in certain areas if relevant. In addition, this information may be aggregated and anonymised for the purposes of engagement with external audiences.</p>

<p><strong>c. Can we use the document reference number in place of question reference in the filename of supporting documents to avoid duplication of documents entered in annex F. With the current filename format of [Project acronym]-[Question reference]-[Doc title] supporting documents will be duplicated where used in several questions as each will need a new filename containing a new question reference.</strong></p>

<p>Please follow the filename format detail within Annex F. Where a document is supporting more than one answer, please use the primary question number that the document is supporting within the file name and use Annex F to clearly mark each question the single document is also supporting. The document must be referenced within all answers within the Project Application Form which it is supporting. It is not necessary to upload the same file twice with a different question number.</p>

<p>Please name all supporting files submitted using a unique project identifier (which applicants are free to select), followed by the primary question number this document supports, followed by the document title. For example, a document reference may be:</p>

<p>HYDROGEN1-5.3.2.1-SCHEDULE</p>

<p><strong>024. a. Over what time period is having viable offtakes for 75% of hydrogen production calculated? Is this annually from year 1 of operation or can this be averaged over a longer time period if the off-taker is ramps up their demand? For example, if the off-taker ramps up to taking 100% of the hydrogen production by year 3 would this have an impact on the scoring if the off-taker requires only 40% of the hydrogen produced in year 1. Over a 10 year period, this off-taker will take approximately 90% of the hydrogen produced.</strong></p>

<p>A Project’s Deliverability score will be based on their performance against three key factors. One of which being <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ confidence that the project has commercial and technical arrangements in place with viable off-takers for most (75% or above) of their hydrogen volumes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> understands that offtaker plans and arrangements may not be fully in place at the point of application submission. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will consider the strength of evidence provided to assess the credibility and likelihood of that offtaker agreement being secured in the future, including post the Commercial Operation Date (<abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr>).&nbsp; Projects with firm commitments from offtakers for 100% of the hydrogen production from the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> will score higher than projects with a lower percentage allocated to offtakers, and/or less firm offtaker commitments in place.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will consider the strength of the evidence for any offtaker plans for any surplus production over and above that of the firm offtakers identified at the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr>. Where there is a credible plan to supply an offtaker within for example one year (counting towards the 75%), this will score higher than a plan to supply an offtaker in future years, but both will score lower than a project with firm commitments to supply from the operational date. As set out in the Application Guidance, projects should be able to demonstrate commitments for most of the hydrogen production, which as a minimum should be at least 50% of their hydrogen volumes.</p>

<p>Projects are assessed on this volume during the evaluation stage; however, it should be noted that this may be considered as a factor during the agreeing an offer stage when setting the terms of the contract.</p>

<p><strong>b. Regarding the requirement to provide ultimate parent’s statutory accounts, management account to-date and financing forecast covering the current financial year and further 4 years, could we please clarify whether it is possible to submit the required documents for a company within the ownership structure, i.e. between the ultimate parent and project company? If so, is there any requirements for the minimum value of net asset or similar metrics?</strong></p>

<p>We require the information to be submitted for the ultimate parent as opposed to an intermediate parent level. We will be looking to ensure that the ultimate parent is in a suitable financial position to be able to offer a guarantee against any grant funding that is made available.</p>

<p><strong>025. If a developer is expecting to be both the producer and user/offtaker of the hydrogen what evidence would <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expect in relation to the mandatory information and supporting information for section 5.4.1 ‘Hydrogen Offtaker’?</strong></p>

<p>The evidence required from own consumption must still provide assessors with the same level of information as that detailed on pages 49 and 50 of the Application Guidance document. Applicants must use discretion and other supporting information that will help the assessors understand the credibility of the proposed offtake (even if it is self-owned). For example, Projects may provide a letter of support from their board for switching to hydrogen produced by this hydrogen plant.</p>

<h2>Clarification questions, 9 August 2022</h2>

<p><strong>001. Whether changes to your responses are possible after EOI submission or will your responses to the EOI be taken as firm responses?</strong></p>

<p>Further information on the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> process can be found on page 16 of the Application Guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants are asked to confirm in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> that to the best of their knowledge they meet the mandatory eligibility criteria. Government may provide feedback if it appears your Project is unlikely to meet the criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> answers are considered as indicative only and not as firm responses. Projects will not be prevented from making a full application based on the information provided in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr>.</p>

<p>The final submission which will be due by 12 October will require you to provide supporting evidence to prove you meet the eligibility criteria. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria and the minimum deliverability score will continue to the evaluation stage where they will be assessed against a set of defined evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><strong>002. An interpretation of the guidance which meant that we would have to wait for a future Strand 3 competition rather than bid now would mean that either:</strong></p>

<p><strong>i. production is unnecessarily delayed by a year (which is contrary to the higher objective of bringing capacity online by end of 2025) whilst we wait for the next round.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Or</strong></p>

<p><strong>ii. if we withdraw our Strand 1 application in order to submit a Strand 3 application, we will have to seek additional investor funding to complete the <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> and the reserved matters (planning) application. This will take time and possibly delay or even stop the project.</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the guidance, Projects will only be able to apply to one strand per project at any one time and cannot switch between strands once they’ve been awarded funding for a project.</p>

<p>Projects applying for strand 1 (April – June 2022) will not be eligible to apply for strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as their strand 1 application will still be live during the time of this strand 3 application window. These projects may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round.</p>

<p>The rationale for this approach is that as set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> is at an advanced stage.</p>

<p>Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July – 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the strand 3 application window closes.</p>

<p>Strand 1 of the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aims to grow the pipeline of projects in the UK by providing development support for <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies, and we expect that projects supported through strand 1 will go on to apply for <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support in future allocation rounds.</p>

<p>As such applicants will need to consider whether their project is able to progress without strand 1 development funding if they wish to apply for strand 3. If your project requires strand 1 development support, you may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round. Alternatively, you may withdraw your Strand 1 application in order to submit an application for the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round. This must be done before the deadline for the Expression of Interest submissions on 7th September 2022, as Projects must submit an <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> to be considered under this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>003. a. Please can you provide a contact point or e-mail address within the Department for Transport to which any requests for in principle letters of support can be directed?</strong></p>

<p>Guidance from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation">Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (<abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>) gov.uk page</a> contains full information on the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> registration process, including the contact email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk">rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>b. Is there any existing DfT document or form which sets out the information needed to be provided to DfT- &nbsp;before they can provide an in principle letter of support?</strong></p>

<p>There is a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-transport-fuel-obligation-rtfo-guidance-2021">gov.uk <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> guidance page</a> that provides information on complying, reporting and verifying with the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> process for fuel suppliers, independent verifiers and those supplying road transport biofuels. DfT do not require the full registration for the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> to get an in-principle assessment letter. Please contact the email address provided in answer 1 with a request for an in-principle fuel assessment – there is no existing document/form.</p>

<p><strong>c. If a project does not rely on <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support, but wishes to retain the option of taking advantage of <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support for some hydrogen volumes produced by the project, is it necessary to upload an in principle letter of support at the application stage, or would it be sufficient to indicate within the bid documentation that this option may be pursued for some project hydrogen volumes?</strong></p>

<p>Government recognises that some Projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>, subject to meeting the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> and <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and an enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p>If the Project does not rely on <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support, there is no need to upload an in-principle letter at the application stage, given that the Project will be assessed on its ability to meet the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round’s eligibility criteria, and then scored against the evaluation criteria, as set out in the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>004. a. Noting that the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> will be allowed for “own consumption” projects, could you confirm that <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr> under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> can be claimed for “own consumption”?&nbsp; How does the evidence required for ‘own consumption’ offtake differ from that required for other hydrogen offtakers (i.e. as set out on pg 50 of the Application Guidance).</strong></p>

<p>Yes, <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr> under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> can be claimed for “own consumption”, i.e. in-house vehicle fleets. The evidence required from own consumption must still provide assessors with the same level of information as that detailed on pages 49 and 50 of the Application Guidance document. Applicants must use discretion and other supporting information that will help the assessors understand the credibility of the proposed offtake (even if it is self-owned). For example, Projects may provide a letter of support from their board for switching to hydrogen produced by this hydrogen plant.</p>

<p>Government recognises that some projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>, subject to meeting the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> and <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>b. Under the electricity supply criteria (section 5.4.2 of application form), what evidence is required? Will an MoU suffice or is a Term Sheet required?</strong></p>

<p>Section 5.4.2 has both a mandatory and supporting information section. Across each of the evaluation criteria, Projects should provide supporting information and evidence which demonstrates the credibility of Projections made in their submission. The onus will be on the Project Representative to demonstrate to government the credibility of information in a way that the Project considers to be most appropriate.</p>

<p>The quality of evidence is critical in reviewing the application. Lack of evidence or poor-quality evidence may negatively impact the assessment of the project. For example, Deliverability will be assessed against factors including the confidence in the commercial arrangements of the Project. Projects should consider the mandatory and supporting evidence which may be included in different sections of the Project Application.</p>

<ul>
  <li>mandatory information: an Excel table showing the electricity generation profile over a representative annual cycle during its operation, if applicable. Please remember to include any planned maintenance schedules and the expected frequency of unplanned system downtime</li>
  <li>supporting Information: Evidence could include, but is not limited to, the following types of documentation for this assessment criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>details of the intended power purchase agreement that is being considered (including agreed duration, parties in agreement, quantity of power supply, location of power supply)</li>
      <li>details of the power procurement strategy or methodology statement</li>
      <li>DNO engagement on grid capacity and reinforcement requirements</li>
      <li>direct wire connection to a renewable energy generation Project</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c. Under the additionality criteria, what is defined as ‘new’ asset? In other words, how new is new?</strong></p>

<p>Section 4.3.6 of the Application Guidance document sets out that an additional electricity source can be: New purpose-built assets - Electricity provided by new/recently built low carbon generation assets, built (or partially built) without securing a government support contract (e.g. RO/CfD). For example, electricity that would not have existed/been available for the grid if not for the hydrogen production, meaning that it can be deemed additional and will not be diverting low carbon electricity from other users.</p>

<p><strong>d. When will you be able to confirm details for how hydrogen sold to offtakers using it as a feedstock will be treated under the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>? Will this hydrogen still be eligible for support if derivative products (e.g. ammonia) are exported?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently working through the detailed policy positions on both of these questions and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>e. If hydrogen is injected as a blend into a&nbsp;private&nbsp;natural gas network to support the decarbonisation of multiple industrial offtakers that connect to that network, would this hydrogen be available for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team continue to work through the policy position on the injection of hydrogen into private natural gas networks.</p>

<p><strong>f. When will the clarification question answers be published?</strong></p>

<p>The Clarification Questions will be published on a rolling basis throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>005. ‘If 5MW is the minimum, what is the maximum hydrogen production project you are seeking’. For example, could it be 50MW.</strong></p>

<p>There is no defined maximum limit to a Project. Government hopes to support at least 250MW via the first Electrolytic Allocation Round, although it retains the right to allocate less. For example, if insufficient Projects come forward that meet the eligibility criteria or that present good value for money to government.</p>

<p>Government is looking to fund a portfolio of projects and to do this government may adopt a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio. This is intended to make sure this round has a spread of projects that meet the allocation round’s objectives, balanced across the relevant variables, including size. As such, government reserves the right at its absolute discretion to limit the number of projects which will be shortlisted to participate in the next stage through the application of portfolio factors after assessment of individual Projects.</p>

<p>Please refer to section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document for more information on the application of portfolio factors, including their variables.</p>

<p><strong>006. Can you please clarify if all sub-questions 1-8 in Question 5.2.1 are to be answered by each and every potential off-taker?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the Project Application Form, section 5.2.1 is primarily for the primary and parent/ultimate parent company to provide information on their financial and commercial health, as well as understand the companies’ strategic objectives. Questions 1 to 6 and question 8 relate entirely to the applicant company, its ultimate parent company and any joint or consortium partners.</p>

<p>Sub-question 7 requests information on offtakers associated with the project, this includes the current status of any agreements between the applicant and the offtaker, the terms of those agreements, including what proportion of the intended production the offtaker represents.</p>

<p><strong>007. a. Does the minimum capacity of 5 MW refer to the capacity of the electrolyser, or the volume of hydrogen produced? The two are considerably different. If it refers to the volume of hydrogen produced, could you clarify whether this assumes the <abbr title="lower heating value">LHV</abbr> or <abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr> of hydrogen? Better still, if you could provide the minimum production capacity in kg/day of hydrogen that would avoid any confusion.</strong></p>

<p>Government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) basis. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>b. What is the certainty around a second window for Strand 2 of the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>? E.g if we choose not to apply for Strand 3, can you guarantee there will be future <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> funding available via a second window of Strand 2?</strong></p>

<p>Whilst we anticipate that there will be another <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 2 funding window early next year, it is dependent on the outcome of the first strand 2 window, and we cannot provide any guarantees at this stage.</p>

<p><strong>008. A question about planning permissions for the project. Is this a condition that needs to be met ahead of subsidy award in July 2023? And therefore do I need to evidence that we have started or even secured planning permission to place the application or just include it as part of the project timeline? Could I secure the permits post July 2023 and still meet the criteria required?</strong></p>

<p>The securing of planning permissions is not a mandatory condition that must be met ahead of shortlisting and assessment. However, Projects will be scored on the information relevant to the securing of planning permission within the Project Application Form  , further information on this can be found in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document. This sets out that any decision to award support under this process will also be subject to conditions being satisfied, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>projects demonstrating sufficient progress towards satisfying pre-contract signature requirements (e.g., obtaining any necessary planning and environmental consents, grid connection); and</li>
  <li>projects agreeing final terms with government</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects are asked within section 5.3.2 of the Project Application Form to provide an integrated Level 2 fully logic linked, cost and resource loaded schedule for the Project for the project development, construction and commissioning phases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development of all critical components of the Project, Production Facility, offtaker development, electricity supply and storage and distribution where applicable</li>
  <li>clearly show the critical path, float and any key milestones such as: planning, consents, decisions gates, long lead equipment items, power grid and water connections, <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr>, <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 5.3.3 further requests information on Planning &amp; Consenting. Projects are expected to provide information on all planning and consenting requirements, including all outstanding work required and the critical dependencies being managed to ensure these are achieved.</p>

<p><strong>009. If a project were to propose a <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> with a strike price linked to the price of dispensed hydrogen for use in mobility applications, and the project had secured an offtaker who was&nbsp;not&nbsp;also in receipt of <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support, how would the project be treated for assessment purposes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>My reading of the brief is that mobility offtakers are not explicitly classified as ineligible, as long as the mobility offtaker is not receiving <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support to avoid over-subsidy. My concern is rather that the existence of the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> as an alternative support mechanism for mobility projects may lead <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to take the view that the project should not therefore be prioritised for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support, reducing the likelihood of a successful application outcome.</strong></p>

<p>Mobility applications are not included within the list of non-qualifying offtakers for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, as set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document. The existence of alternative support is not a valid consideration in the process of project selection.</p>

<p>Section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document sets out how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may apply a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio, with further information on how this may be applied to ensure diversity of end use and electricity source/operating model.  The use of portfolio factors is aimed at addressing excessive risk concentration or homogeneity that may arise from a portfolio constructed only of the highest scoring standalone Projects.</p>

<p><strong>010. May I understand whether hydrogen projects that aim to secure power through grid connected PPAs will be exempt from grid levies including but not limited to:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Capacity Market levy<br>- Renewable Obligation<br>- CfD operational levy<br>- FiT levelisation</strong></p>

<p>Through the Energy Intensive Industries (EII) Scheme, hydrogen producers may be eligible for an exemption from the indirect costs of funding the low carbon electricity CfD, RO and FiT (through ‘green levies’) which are currently passed through electricity bills. Hydrogen is covered under ‘industrial gases’ in the exemption scheme, and Projects using grid connected electricity will be those potentially eligible. To check eligibility or to discuss specific questions related to the scheme, hydrogen producers should contact the EII team directly at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:energyintensiveindustries@beis.gov.uk">energyintensiveindustries@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The EII exemption scheme will shortly go out for a review via consultation. This consultation will cover a range of issues, including whether the exemption scheme should extend sector eligibility and how the scheme should be implemented in future (for example whether the proportion of exemption should be increased). We will keep industry informed of when this consultation is published.</p>

<p>There is a separate Energy Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme, for indirect emission costs in electricity prices (arising from ETS and CPS) which are incurred by fossil-fuel power stations and passed through electricity bills. This scheme does not currently cover industrial gases, and therefore hydrogen production is not eligible.</p>

<p><strong>011. a. When will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> confirm the project eligibility?&nbsp; The guidance says there will be initial feedback if they don’t think it meets the eligibility on submission of EOI, but for cluster sequencing for carbon capture and storage phase 2 a list of confirmed eligible projects was published some months later.&nbsp; Are <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> planning to do the same for this and if yes when?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> does not intend to announce a list of eligible Projects, those Projects that are found to be ineligible will be informed by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> that they will not be taken forward to the evaluation stage . However, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> does intend to announce a list of shortlisted Projects (those taken through to the Agreeing an Offer stage) in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>b. Can <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> confirm/be more specific on timing for confirmation of the shortlist?</strong></p>

<p>As stated above, shortlisted Projects will be announced in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>c. How long does <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> anticipate the agreeing an offer stage will take?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expects the agreeing an offer stage to take place from early to mid-2023, with the aim to award contracts from July 2023.</p>

<p><strong>d. When does <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> anticipate confirming that the specified <abbr title="final investment decision">FID</abbr> and <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> dates are no longer a requirement and can be subject to discussion with <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> and re-forecasting, if the contracts cannot be finalized by July 2023?</strong></p>

<p>The requirement for the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> no later than the end of 2025 is dependent on the signing of contracts from July 2023 – if signing of contracts is delayed beyond July 2023 due to reasons outside the Applicant’s control, for example due to delays to the Agreeing an Offer process, government reserves the right to allow the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> to be extended upon receiving an applicant’s request.    <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ decision would be dependent on the timing of such request and will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>e. If projects are not taken forward in this first application phase, will the application be transferred into the 2023 ‘second’ application phase?&nbsp; What will be done to streamline the application process for both industry and government such that effort is not duplicated in the second phase?</strong></p>

<p>Government is aiming to open a similar process to this Electrolytic Allocation Round in 2023, for contract award in 2024. As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, government is aiming to move to price competitive allocation from 2025 onwards as soon as legislation and market conditions allow. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ assumption is that because criteria might change, a new application will be required for Projects that are unsuccessful in the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round, this will be kept under review.</p>

<p><strong>f. Government defines <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> in the eligibility criteria as being different from <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> under the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>.&nbsp; Can this be explained further?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> in the context of new build hydrogen production facilities for this joint allocation round means the date when the facility is commissioned and ready to commence operations. The LCHA will include a more detailed set of definitions related to the commissioning of the facility, for example “Operational Conditions Precedent”, “Start Date” and “Target Commissioning Window”. Please refer to the Indicative Heads of Terms for further details, noting that the Heads of Terms are preliminary and indicative only and the provisions set out therein are subject to further consideration and development by government.</p>

<p><strong>g. Has the duration of the Target Commissioning Window been confirmed?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>h. Will the TCW have a backstop of end of 2025, or if projects have a <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> of December 2025 will the TCW be 12 months from then (if TCW duration is 12 months) i.e. Dec 2025 – Dec 2026?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>i. Can <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> provide more info or detail on timeline for the second application phase window in 2026?</strong></p>

<p>The second joint allocation round is aimed to take place in 2023. For future allocation rounds, government may consider reviewing the eligibility and evaluation criteria and expects to set out a target <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> for the 2023 allocation round by Q2 2023.</p>

<p><strong>j. Is there any benefit or credit, either through the additionality scoring or the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, to having a physical connection to a renewable electricity source where additionality of the electricity source can’t otherwise be demonstrated?</strong></p>

<p>Demonstrating additionality of electricity source is not a mandatory requirement under the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard or as an eligibility requirement for applicants to this allocation round. However, we recognise that Projects that can meet our principles for additionality of electricity source will be lowest emission from a systems perspective and may also support deployment of new build generation. Therefore, Projects that can provide clear and credible evidence that they are using electricity sources deemed additional according to the hierarchy of principles set out in 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document, will be able to receive credit. The specific evidence requirements that will be considered at assessment stage to prove these principles have been met are outlined in the guidance.</p>

<p><strong>k. Can any Capex expenditure incurred before signing a contract be claimed through the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> or <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> funding, noting that if a contract is not achieved that there will be no obligation on government to pay any capex already incurred?</strong></p>

<p>Government will not be responsible for, nor make any commitment in respect of, costs incurred before the signature of any LCHA or Grant Offer Letter.</p>

<p><strong>l. Can any Devex expenditure incurred before signing a contract be claimed through the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> or <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> funding, noting that if a contract is not achieved that there will be no obligation on government to pay any capex already incurred?</strong></p>

<p>As above, Government will not be responsible for, nor make any commitment in respect of, costs incurred before the signature of any LCHA or Grant Offer Letter.</p>

<h2>Briefing event, 27 July  2022: clarification questions</h2>

<p><strong>BE1. What is the total amount of funding that has been earmarked for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>? Annual breakdown and total funding through the length of the contract.</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> funding for projects operational before 2025 will be provided by up to £100m of taxpayer funding that was committed through the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme in the Net Zero Strategy. It is intended that all <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support will be levy funded from 2025 onwards, subject to consultation and Parliamentary approval of any legislation required.</p>

<p>For this allocation round, we intend to publish a Budget Notice alongside the shortlist announcement in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE2. Will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> be announcing a list of eligible projects and if so, when?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> does not intend to announce a list of eligible projects, those projects that are found to be ineligible will be informed by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> that they will not be taken forward to the evaluation stage.. However, <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> does intend to announce a list of shortlisted projects (those taken through to the Agreeing an Offer stage) in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE3. Is an indicative strike price needed before the shortlisting process?</strong></p>

<p>No, an indicative strike price is not needed before the shortlisting process. Projects will be assessed against the six evaluation criteria set out in section 4 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE4. Can you explain a bit more about how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> will assess whether projects are “materially different”?</strong></p>

<p>For the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>/ <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round, a business can lead on up to four applications, which must be materially different, and can be included as a collaborator, or project partner, in a further four applications. This approach will be reviewed, and future allocation rounds may allow businesses to lead on and be included as a collaborator on more than four applications.</p>

<p>Material difference will be assessed based on a number of factors such as project size, technology, end use, and location.</p>

<p><strong>BE5. Will the qualifying offtakers be updated as the hydrogen economy expands?</strong></p>

<p>Government will consider the need to review its position on qualifying offtakers in future, both for existing contracts and future allocation rounds.</p>

<p><strong>BE6. If a project is less than 5MW can we still apply for the fund?</strong></p>

<p>No, for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output), on a High Heating Value (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) basis. This will ensure government is using its limited resources on assessing projects which can contribute to helping government meet its commitments on having 1GW of electrolytic hydrogen in operation or construction by 2025 and 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030.</p>

<p><strong>BE7. Can a company applying for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> be its own offtaker?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, subject to compliance with subsidy control rules and potential adjustments to the hydrogen business model, own consumption is allowed under the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, as detailed on page 14 of the government response to consultation on a business model for low carbon hydrogen. This offtake must be eligible under the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> as detailed in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE8. We don’t seem to have visibility on how the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support will work in practice and over what period. Can this be explained please?</strong></p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> expects the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement to have a contract term between 10 and 15 years. This reflects: (i) the precedents set by the low carbon electricity CfD and CCUS Programme HoTs; (ii) the potential time for this nascent hydrogen market to develop; and (iii) a balance between providing price support certainty for Producers for a proportionate and reasonable period, whilst not locking in production pathways for the long term.</p>

<p>For further information on how the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> will work in practice, including details of its operational period, please refer to the government response to the consultation on a low carbon hydrogen business model and the Indicative Heads of Terms document.</p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team continues to work to finalise the contract that successful projects will receive and will set out further detail on the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> design in due course. The <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> team are aiming to finalise the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> in 2022 with a view to awarding the first <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> contracts from next year.</p>

<p><strong>BE9. I have an application in for a 5MW electrolyser under <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 1. Should I also be applying for this funding stream?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the guidance, Projects will only be able to apply to one strand per project at any one time and cannot switch between strands once they’ve been awarded funding for a project.</p>

<p>Projects applying for strand 1 (April – June 2022) will not be eligible to apply for strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as their strand 1 application will still be live during the time of this strand 3 application window. These projects may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round.</p>

<p>The rationale for this approach is that as set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> is at an advanced stage.</p>

<p>Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July – 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the strand 3 application window closes.</p>

<p>Strand 1 of the <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> aims to grow the pipeline of projects in the UK by providing development support for <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> and post-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> studies, and we expect that projects supported through strand 1 will go on to apply for <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support in future allocation rounds.</p>

<p>As such applicants will need to consider whether their project is able to progress without strand 1 development funding if they wish to apply for strand 3. If your project requires strand 1 development support, you may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round. Alternatively, you may withdraw your Strand 1 application in order to submit an application for the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round. This must be done before the deadline for the Expression of Interest submissions on 7 September 2022, as Projects must submit an <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> to be considered under this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>BE10. How do you expect high energy prices to influence the difference between the hydrogen strike and reference prices, and how do you expect that the influence what <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> can now achieve with the £100m that’s available?</strong></p>

<p>Price support will be provided through a variable premium price support model where the subsidy is the difference between a ‘strike price’ reflecting the cost of producing hydrogen and a ‘reference price’ reflecting the market value of hydrogen.</p>

<p>In the absence of a wholesale market price, the reference price is based on the producer’s achieved sales price, with a floor at the natural gas price, and a contractual mechanism to incentivise the producer to find the true value of hydrogen.</p>

<p>The amount of subsidy adjusts through the reference price. If natural gas prices rise, the level of government support reduces, and if they fall, the level of support rises.</p>

<p>The budget of up to £100m is to cover the period up to 2025. The business model, via the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme, will provide annual revenue support for the duration of the business model contract awarded to each project.</p>

<p><strong>BE11. What <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> date will a Strand 3 allocation round running summer 2023 require?</strong></p>

<p>For future allocation rounds, government will consider reviewing the eligibility and evaluation criteria and expects to set out a target <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> for the 2023 allocation round by Q2 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE12. Please can you provide a contact for progressing an <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> qualification in-principle letter?</strong></p>

<p>DfT do not require the full registration for the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> to get an in-principle assessment letter.</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk">rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk</a> with a request for an in-principle assessment letter for more information please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation</a> .</p>

<p><strong>BE13. In terms of the offtake agreement, we note that this has to be agreed before submission of the application but the LCHA will only be entered into a later stage. What factors should be taken into account when agreeing the Offtake Agreement to make its terms compliant?</strong></p>

<p>Section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document provides applicants with the information needed to ensure the terms of their Offtake Agreement are compliant with the LCHA.</p>

<p><strong>BE14. Can you please confirm whether the 5MW requirement refers to the capacity of the electrolyser or to volume of hydrogen produced?</strong></p>

<p>Government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (<abbr title="higher heating value">HHV</abbr>) basis. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>BE15. Will the assessment criteria be carried forward into competitive auction rounds in later years? If so, how will that work? Or will it just be based on cost at that point?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, government is aiming to move to price competitive allocation from 2025 onwards as soon as legislation and market conditions allow. These future rounds may include scope for non-CCUS, non-solely electrolytic technologies for hydrogen production such as biomass. <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> has not yet laid out eligibility and evaluation criteria for these rounds but will do so in future.</p>

<p><strong>BE16. Will the target commissioning window have an end date of Dec 2025?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>BE17. Will projects targeting mobility offtake be eligible for <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> support with a strike price reflecting the price of dispensed hydrogen for use in mobility applications, as long as the mobility offtaker is not also in receipt of <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> support? i.e does <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> have a view on how projects will be scored if they are seeking to use the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> as an alternative to the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> to support mobility projects?</strong></p>

<p>Mobility applications are not included within the list of non-qualifying offtakers for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, as set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document. The existence of alternative support is not a valid consideration in the process of project selection.</p>

<p>Section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document sets out how <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> may apply a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio, with further information on how this may be applied to ensure diversity of end use and electricity source/operating model. The use of portfolio factors is aimed at addressing excessive risk concentration or homogeneity that may arise from a portfolio constructed only of the highest scoring standalone Projects.</p>

<p><strong>BE18. Will there be a standard approach to calculating jobs released to ensure parity between project calculations?</strong></p>

<p>Evaluation against the Economic Benefits criterion will be undertaken on the basis of information provided through the Economic Benefits Template (Annex C) and answers provided within the Project Application Form, alongside any associated supporting documentation.</p>

<p>The Economic Benefits Template is structured to allow Projects to provide data for both the direct and indirect jobs they expect to provide throughout Project development and operations. As with other criteria, the onus will be on the Project to provide sufficient supporting information and justification for any assumptions made, and assessors will be instructed to score accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>BE19. <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> costs for transport and storage are stated as excluded within the scope of supply of <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr>. Would this also apply to transport via a private pipeline from generation to a third party, e.g if h2 is generated on-site and sold over the fence to an offtaker.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> costs for storage and transport are not included within scope of <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> funding under this Joint Allocation round. However, the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> funding may include revenue support for small-scale hydrogen transport and storage. Any support will be negotiated on a project-by-project basis by taking several factors into account, including necessity, affordability and <abbr title="value for money">VfM</abbr> for government. More specifically, and as set out in the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> indicative Heads of Terms, this could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr>, but not <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr>, costs associated with small-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, and</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> and/or <abbr title="operating expenditure">OPEX</abbr> costs associated with small-scale storage infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BE20. With additionality so low, do you actually expect anyone to take on the additional costs and logistical issue for only 5%? Have <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> basically given up on additionality?</strong></p>

<p>The weighting for the Additionality upholds the additionality principles set out in the consultation response to the <abbr title="low carbon hydrogen standard">LCHS</abbr>, which sought to incentivise, but does not mandate, an additionality requirement around electricity source for electrolytic projects. The government recognises the benefits of additionality but understands that demonstrating additionality of electricity sources may not be achievable for some projects, and therefore have not made this a mandatory requirement to apply to this allocation round or applied a minimum score to this criterion.</p>

<p><strong>BE21. While capacity cannot be phased, can the input of renewable power be phased and still be eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. More information on the additionality evaluation criterion can be found in section 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE22. Will external funding be scored more highly than on-balance sheet?</strong></p>

<p>No, Projects are not scored more highly for having one type of finance over another. In seeking to identify Projects which are most suited to deployment in the mid-2020s, government will place significant emphasis on the credibility and consistency of information provided. This will also be taken as evidence of the maturity of submissions. As set out in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document, Projects are scored on government’s confidence in the financial viability of the organisation and/or their ability to finance project.</p>

<p><strong>BE23. Can you clarify the significance of the different negotiation pathways you mentioned and what is the latest date you envisage more complex project pathways signing LCH agreements?</strong></p>

<p>Information on the structure of the Agreeing an Offer stage can be found in section 5.4 of the Application Guidance document. Government expects the Agreeing an Offer stage to take place from early to mid-2023. More information on this stage, including details of the respective pathways, will be set out when the shortlist is announced in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE24. For the demonstration of qualified offtaker, non-binding agreements like MoU will suffice for making the application or are binding agreements required?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document, Projects are expected to provide an agreement or evidence of progress towards an agreement with hydrogen offtakers. For example, this could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a letter of intent or provisional agreement with offtakers</li>
  <li>Memoranda of Understanding, collaboration agreements or draft Heads of Terms being in place between the hydrogen producer and its proposed offtakers</li>
  <li>Government recognises that the level of commitment in place between an early-stage Project and its partners may naturally vary depending on the Project’s stage of development so any evidence of formal and informal agreements and discussions would be welcome</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BE25. Regarding the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> by 2025, apart from the delay in contract signature, can we get an extension on <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> and still be eligible for funding.</strong></p>

<p>Applicants will need to demonstrate within their submission that they meet the “Commercial Operation Date (<abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr>) by end of 2025” eligibility criterion. As set out in section 3.2 of the Application Guidance document, the requirement for the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> no later than the end of 2025 is dependent on the signing of contracts from July 2023 – if signing of contracts is delayed beyond July 2023 due to reasons outside the Applicants control, for example due to delays to the Agreeing an Offer process, government reserves the right to allow the <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> to be extended upon receiving an applicant’s request.</p>

<p><strong>BE26. The funding applies to hydrogen production facilities in the UK, does the off-taker have to be located in UK or can they be for overseas?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document, and as set out in the response to the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> consultation, given the primary objective of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> is to kickstart the UK’s low carbon hydrogen economy, volumes of hydrogen intended for export will not be eligible for revenue support.</p>

<p><strong>BE27. You state an eligibility criterion that technology must be at TRL 7 but also have a bid evaluation criteria to progress technological development and innovation – these seem at odds with each other?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 3.3 of the Application Guidance document, to be eligible to apply to this Electrolytic Allocation Round projects must be using core production technology that has been tested in a commercial environment, with a TRL of 7 or more. This criterion ensures our funding picks up where <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> innovation funding ends. In this context, the core production technology refers to the electrolyser, and government believes that both PEM and Alkaline electrolysers meet this requirement.</p>

<p>The Market Development &amp; Learning evaluation criterion asks Projects to demonstrate how their hydrogen production plans and associated infrastructure contribute to the development of a hydrogen market. Government wants Projects to demonstrate how they will create and share knowledge from early hydrogen deployment and promote innovations.</p>

<p><strong>BE28. Can a non-UK electrolysis manufacturer be involved in projects as long as a Project Representative is a UK based company?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is no eligibility requirement about the Project having a UK based electrolyser supplier. Projects must however meet the eligibility criterion of “Project plant located entirely in the United Kingdom and the Project Representative’s business being registered in the UK”.</p>

<p><strong>BE29. What is the requirement for additionality for the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, is it true the same as outlined whereby meeting low-carbon hydrogen standard is the only requirement noting scoring favours additionality?</strong></p>

<p>Demonstrating additionality of electricity source is not a mandatory requirement under the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard or as an eligibility requirement for applicants to this allocation round.</p>

<p>However, projects that can provide clear and credible evidence that they are using electricity sources deemed additional according to the hierarchy of principles set out in 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document, will be able to receive credit. The specific evidence requirements that will be considered at assessment stage to prove these principles have been met are outlined in section 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE30. Can you please confirm when answers to any clarification questions will be published? (i.e will answers be provided on a rolling basis before the submission deadline?)</strong></p>

<p>Answers to clarification questions will be posted on a rolling basis on gov.uk throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>BE31. Projects with a <abbr title="commercial operation date">COD</abbr> in 2025 are likely to still be in pre-<abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> stages at the time of application. How will <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> deal with uncertainty in the project costs at this stage?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that <abbr title="front end engineering design">FEED</abbr> is at an advanced stage. Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the 2022 <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM/NZHF</abbr> Electrolytic Allocation Round closes.</p>

<p>In seeking to identify Projects which are most suited to deployment in the mid-2020s, government will place significant emphasis on the credibility and consistency of information provided. This will also be taken as evidence of the maturity of submissions.</p>

<p>With this in mind, government would advise Project Representatives to ensure that all Projections made in their Project Application Form and wider submission (including deployment dates, emissions volumes, and cost profiles) are robust and properly supported by the accompanying documentation that they submit.</p>

<p><strong>BE32. Is it the case that projects financially supported by <abbr title="Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">NZHF</abbr> strand 3 cannot also receive the financial benefit of the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> directly? However, offtakers from the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> supported project will be able to receive the value from <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates">RTFCs</abbr>?</strong></p>

<p>It is not the case that projects that receive strand 3 support from the Electrolytic Allocation Round cannot receive the benefit of the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> also.</p>

<p>As set out in Section 2.2 of the Application Guidance document, government recognises that some projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>, subject to meeting the <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr>’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr> and <abbr title="Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation">RTFO</abbr> for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>BE33. When there are two companies working together, what company should respond to the company information sector?</strong></p>

<p>In the context for the Electrolytic Allocation Round, the Project Representative is the lead applicant, responsible for submitting the Expression of Interest form and the final submission.</p>

<p>The Project Representative is expected to be from the primary or partner organisation responsible for Project development, which must be a legal entity.</p>

<p><strong>BE34. Annex G (<abbr title="Environment Agency">EA</abbr> signposting for Hydrogen Projects) is not available on the gov website for download. Is there some other way to access this, or is this just referencing the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator?</strong></p>

<p>A correction has been made to the Project Application Form, where the previously labelled Annex G now refers to Appendix A in the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE35. Can <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> comment further on the subsidy control measures envisaged, particularly around interaction with renewable generation subsidies?</strong></p>

<p>We are considering the interactions with renewable electricity generation subsidies in developing the commercial aspects of the <abbr title="Hydrogen Business Model / Net Zero Hydrogen Fund">HBM</abbr>, including with respect to subsidy control. Any decision to award support will be made subject to government being comfortable with the application of subsidy control requirements. See further information: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments">Complying with the UK’s international obligations on subsidy control guidance for public authorities / technical guidance on the UK’s international subsidy control commitments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BE36. Will the Clarification Questions be posted weekly, if so when each week do you expect to do this?</strong></p>

<p>Answers to the clarification questions will be posted on a rolling basis throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>BE37. How would <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> deal with an application that answers ‘no’ to one of the eligibility criteria? Does that immediately scrap the application or would <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> consider the application if prior contact has been made?</strong></p>

<p>An answer in the eligibility section of the Online Application Form that fails to meet the required eligibility criteria will result in the Project Representative being unable to proceed with all subsequent sections.</p>

<p><strong>BE38. Can the <abbr title="capital expenditure">CAPEX</abbr> stated in the EOI be updated for the final submission?</strong></p>

<p>Further information on the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> process can be found on page 16 of the Application Guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants are asked to confirm in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> that to the best of their knowledge they meet the mandatory eligibility criteria. Government may provide feedback if it appears your Project is unlikely to meet the criteria.</p>

<p><abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr> answers are considered as indicative only and not as firm responses. Projects will not be prevented from making a full application based on the information provided in the <abbr title="expression of interest">EoI</abbr>.</p>

<p>The final submission which will be due by 12 October will require you to provide supporting evidence to prove you meet the eligibility criteria. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria and the minimum deliverability score will continue to the evaluation stage where they will be assessed against a set of defined evaluation criteria.</p>
