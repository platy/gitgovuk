<h2>Clarification questions, 9 August 2022</h2>

<p><strong>001. Whether changes to your responses are possible after EOI submission or will your responses to the EOI be taken as firm responses?</strong></p>

<p>Further information on the EoI process can be found on page 16 of the Application Guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants are asked to confirm in the EoI that to the best of their knowledge they meet the mandatory eligibility criteria. Government may provide feedback if it appears your Project is unlikely to meet the criteria.</p>

<p>EoI answers are considered as indicative only and not as firm responses. Projects will not be prevented from making a full application based on the information provided in the EoI.</p>

<p>The final submission which will be due by 12 October will require you to provide supporting evidence to prove you meet the eligibility criteria. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria and the minimum deliverability score will continue to the evaluation stage where they will be assessed against a set of defined evaluation criteria.</p>

<p><strong>002. An interpretation of the guidance which meant that we would have to wait for a future Strand 3 competition rather than bid now would mean that either:</strong></p>

<p><strong>i. production is unnecessarily delayed by a year (which is contrary to the higher objective of bringing capacity online by end of 2025) whilst we wait for the next round.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Or</strong></p>

<p><strong>ii. if we withdraw our Strand 1 application in order to submit a Strand 3 application, we will have to seek additional investor funding to complete the FEED and the reserved matters (planning) application. This will take time and possibly delay or even stop the project.</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the guidance, Projects will only be able to apply to one strand per project at any one time and cannot switch between strands once they’ve been awarded funding for a project.</p>

<p>Projects applying for strand 1 (April – June 2022) will not be eligible to apply for strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as their strand 1 application will still be live during the time of this strand 3 application window. These projects may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round.</p>

<p>The rationale for this approach is that as set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that FEED is at an advanced stage.</p>

<p>Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July – 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the strand 3 application window closes.</p>

<p>Strand 1 of the NZHF aims to grow the pipeline of projects in the UK by providing development support for FEED and post-FEED studies, and we expect that projects supported through strand 1 will go on to apply for NZHF CAPEX and/or HBM support in future allocation rounds.</p>

<p>As such applicants will need to consider whether their project is able to progress without strand 1 development funding if they wish to apply for strand 3. If your project requires strand 1 development support, you may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round. Alternatively, you may withdraw your Strand 1 application in order to submit an application for the 2022 HBM/NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round. This must be done before the deadline for the Expression of Interest submissions on 7th September 2022, as Projects must submit an EoI to be considered under this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>003. a. Please can you provide a contact point or e-mail address within the Department for Transport to which any requests for in principle letters of support can be directed?</strong></p>

<p>Guidance from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation">Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) gov.uk page</a> contains full information on the RTFO registration process, including the contact email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk">rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>b. Is there any existing DfT document or form which sets out the information needed to be provided to DfT- &nbsp;before they can provide an in principle letter of support?</strong></p>

<p>There is a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/renewable-transport-fuel-obligation-rtfo-guidance-2021">gov.uk RTFO guidance page</a> that provides information on complying, reporting and verifying with the RTFO process for fuel suppliers, independent verifiers and those supplying road transport biofuels. DfT do not require the full registration for the RTFO to get an in-principle assessment letter. Please contact the email address provided in answer 1 with a request for an in-principle fuel assessment – there is no existing document/form.</p>

<p><strong>c. If a project does not rely on RTFO support, but wishes to retain the option of taking advantage of RTFO support for some hydrogen volumes produced by the project, is it necessary to upload an in principle letter of support at the application stage, or would it be sufficient to indicate within the bid documentation that this option may be pursued for some project hydrogen volumes?</strong></p>

<p>Government recognises that some Projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the RTFO. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the HBM, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the RTFO. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the RTFO, subject to meeting the RTFO’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the HBM and RTFO for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and an enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p>If the Project does not rely on RTFO support, there is no need to upload an in-principle letter at the application stage, given that the Project will be assessed on its ability to meet the 2022 HBM/NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round’s eligibility criteria, and then scored against the evaluation criteria, as set out in the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>004. a. Noting that the HBM will be allowed for “own consumption” projects, could you confirm that RTFCs under the RTFO can be claimed for “own consumption”?&nbsp; How does the evidence required for ‘own consumption’ offtake differ from that required for other hydrogen offtakers (i.e. as set out on pg 50 of the Application Guidance).</strong></p>

<p>Yes, RTFCs under the RTFO can be claimed for “own consumption”, i.e. in-house vehicle fleets. The evidence required from own consumption must still provide assessors with the same level of information as that detailed on pages 49 and 50 of the Application Guidance document. Applicants must use discretion and other supporting information that will help the assessors understand the credibility of the proposed offtake (even if it is self-owned). For example, Projects may provide a letter of support from their board for switching to hydrogen produced by this hydrogen plant.</p>

<p>Government recognises that some projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the RTFO. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the HBM, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the RTFO. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the RTFO, subject to meeting the RTFO’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the HBM and RTFO for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>b. Under the electricity supply criteria (section 5.4.2 of application form), what evidence is required? Will an MoU suffice or is a Term Sheet required?</strong></p>

<p>Section 5.4.2 has both a mandatory and supporting information section. Across each of the evaluation criteria, Projects should provide supporting information and evidence which demonstrates the credibility of Projections made in their submission. The onus will be on the Project Representative to demonstrate to government the credibility of information in a way that the Project considers to be most appropriate.</p>

<p>The quality of evidence is critical in reviewing the application. Lack of evidence or poor-quality evidence may negatively impact the assessment of the project. For example, Deliverability will be assessed against factors including the confidence in the commercial arrangements of the Project. Projects should consider the mandatory and supporting evidence which may be included in different sections of the Project Application.</p>

<ul>
  <li>mandatory information: an Excel table showing the electricity generation profile over a representative annual cycle during its operation, if applicable. Please remember to include any planned maintenance schedules and the expected frequency of unplanned system downtime</li>
  <li>supporting Information: Evidence could include, but is not limited to, the following types of documentation for this assessment criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>details of the intended power purchase agreement that is being considered (including agreed duration, parties in agreement, quantity of power supply, location of power supply)</li>
      <li>details of the power procurement strategy or methodology statement</li>
      <li>DNO engagement on grid capacity and reinforcement requirements</li>
      <li>direct wire connection to a renewable energy generation Project</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c. Under the additionality criteria, what is defined as ‘new’ asset? In other words, how new is new?</strong></p>

<p>Section 4.3.6 of the Application Guidance document sets out that an additional electricity source can be: New purpose-built assets - Electricity provided by new/recently built low carbon generation assets, built (or partially built) without securing a government support contract (e.g. RO/CfD). For example, electricity that would not have existed/been available for the grid if not for the hydrogen production, meaning that it can be deemed additional and will not be diverting low carbon electricity from other users.</p>

<p><strong>d. When will you be able to confirm details for how hydrogen sold to offtakers using it as a feedstock will be treated under the HBM? Will this hydrogen still be eligible for support if derivative products (e.g. ammonia) are exported?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently working through the detailed policy positions on both of these questions and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>e. If hydrogen is injected as a blend into a&nbsp;private&nbsp;natural gas network to support the decarbonisation of multiple industrial offtakers that connect to that network, would this hydrogen be available for HBM support?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team continue to work through the policy position on the injection of hydrogen into private natural gas networks.</p>

<p><strong>f. When will the clarification question answers be published?</strong></p>

<p>The Clarification Questions will be published on a rolling basis throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>005. ‘If 5MW is the minimum, what is the maximum hydrogen production project you are seeking’. For example, could it be 50MW.</strong></p>

<p>There is no defined maximum limit to a Project. Government hopes to support at least 250MW via the first Electrolytic Allocation Round, although it retains the right to allocate less. For example, if insufficient Projects come forward that meet the eligibility criteria or that present good value for money to government.</p>

<p>Government is looking to fund a portfolio of projects and to do this government may adopt a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio. This is intended to make sure this round has a spread of projects that meet the allocation round’s objectives, balanced across the relevant variables, including size. As such, government reserves the right at its absolute discretion to limit the number of projects which will be shortlisted to participate in the next stage through the application of portfolio factors after assessment of individual Projects.</p>

<p>Please refer to section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document for more information on the application of portfolio factors, including their variables.</p>

<p><strong>006. Can you please clarify if all sub-questions 1-8 in Question 5.2.1 are to be answered by each and every potential off-taker?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the Project Application Form, section 5.2.1 is primarily for the primary and parent/ultimate parent company to provide information on their financial and commercial health, as well as understand the companies’ strategic objectives. Questions 1 to 6 and question 8 relate entirely to the applicant company, its ultimate parent company and any joint or consortium partners.</p>

<p>Sub-question 7 requests information on offtakers associated with the project, this includes the current status of any agreements between the applicant and the offtaker, the terms of those agreements, including what proportion of the intended production the offtaker represents.</p>

<p><strong>007. a. Does the minimum capacity of 5 MW refer to the capacity of the electrolyser, or the volume of hydrogen produced? The two are considerably different. If it refers to the volume of hydrogen produced, could you clarify whether this assumes the LHV or HHV of hydrogen? Better still, if you could provide the minimum production capacity in kg/day of hydrogen that would avoid any confusion.</strong></p>

<p>Government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (HHV) basis. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>b. What is the certainty around a second window for Strand 2 of the NZHF? E.g if we choose not to apply for Strand 3, can you guarantee there will be future CAPEX funding available via a second window of Strand 2?</strong></p>

<p>Whilst we anticipate that there will be another NZHF strand 2 funding window early next year, it is dependent on the outcome of the first strand 2 window, and we cannot provide any guarantees at this stage.</p>

<p><strong>008. A question about planning permissions for the project. Is this a condition that needs to be met ahead of subsidy award in July 2023? And therefore do I need to evidence that we have started or even secured planning permission to place the application or just include it as part of the project timeline? Could I secure the permits post July 2023 and still meet the criteria required?</strong></p>

<p>The securing of planning permissions is not a mandatory condition that must be met ahead of shortlisting and assessment. However, Projects will be scored on the information relevant to the securing of planning permission within the Project Application Form  , further information on this can be found in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document. This sets out that any decision to award support under this process will also be subject to conditions being satisfied, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>projects demonstrating sufficient progress towards satisfying pre-contract signature requirements (e.g., obtaining any necessary planning and environmental consents, grid connection); and</li>
  <li>projects agreeing final terms with government</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects are asked within section 5.3.2 of the Project Application Form to provide an integrated Level 2 fully logic linked, cost and resource loaded schedule for the Project for the project development, construction and commissioning phases, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the development of all critical components of the Project, Production Facility, offtaker development, electricity supply and storage and distribution where applicable</li>
  <li>clearly show the critical path, float and any key milestones such as: planning, consents, decisions gates, long lead equipment items, power grid and water connections, FID, COD etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 5.3.3 further requests information on Planning &amp; Consenting. Projects are expected to provide information on all planning and consenting requirements, including all outstanding work required and the critical dependencies being managed to ensure these are achieved.</p>

<p><strong>009. If a project were to propose a HBM with a strike price linked to the price of dispensed hydrogen for use in mobility applications, and the project had secured an offtaker who was&nbsp;not&nbsp;also in receipt of RTFO support, how would the project be treated for assessment purposes?</strong></p>

<p><strong>My reading of the brief is that mobility offtakers are not explicitly classified as ineligible, as long as the mobility offtaker is not receiving RTFO support to avoid over-subsidy. My concern is rather that the existence of the RTFO as an alternative support mechanism for mobility projects may lead BEIS to take the view that the project should not therefore be prioritised for HBM support, reducing the likelihood of a successful application outcome.</strong></p>

<p>Mobility applications are not included within the list of non-qualifying offtakers for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, as set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document. The existence of alternative support is not a valid consideration in the process of project selection.</p>

<p>Section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document sets out how BEIS may apply a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio, with further information on how this may be applied to ensure diversity of end use and electricity source/operating model.  The use of portfolio factors is aimed at addressing excessive risk concentration or homogeneity that may arise from a portfolio constructed only of the highest scoring standalone Projects.</p>

<p><strong>010. May I understand whether hydrogen projects that aim to secure power through grid connected PPAs will be exempt from grid levies including but not limited to:</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Capacity Market levy<br>- Renewable Obligation<br>- CfD operational levy<br>- FiT levelisation</strong></p>

<p>Through the Energy Intensive Industries (EII) Scheme, hydrogen producers may be eligible for an exemption from the indirect costs of funding the low carbon electricity CfD, RO and FiT (through ‘green levies’) which are currently passed through electricity bills. Hydrogen is covered under ‘industrial gases’ in the exemption scheme, and Projects using grid connected electricity will be those potentially eligible. To check eligibility or to discuss specific questions related to the scheme, hydrogen producers should contact the EII team directly at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:energyintensiveindustries@beis.gov.uk">energyintensiveindustries@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The EII exemption scheme will shortly go out for a review via consultation. This consultation will cover a range of issues, including whether the exemption scheme should extend sector eligibility and how the scheme should be implemented in future (for example whether the proportion of exemption should be increased). We will keep industry informed of when this consultation is published.</p>

<p>There is a separate Energy Intensive Industries Compensation Scheme, for indirect emission costs in electricity prices (arising from ETS and CPS) which are incurred by fossil-fuel power stations and passed through electricity bills. This scheme does not currently cover industrial gases, and therefore hydrogen production is not eligible.</p>

<p><strong>011. a. When will BEIS confirm the project eligibility?&nbsp; The guidance says there will be initial feedback if they don’t think it meets the eligibility on submission of EOI, but for cluster sequencing for carbon capture and storage phase 2 a list of confirmed eligible projects was published some months later.&nbsp; Are BEIS planning to do the same for this and if yes when?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS does not intend to announce a list of eligible Projects, those Projects that are found to be ineligible will be informed by BEIS that they will not be taken forward to the evaluation stage . However, BEIS does intend to announce a list of shortlisted Projects (those taken through to the Agreeing an Offer stage) in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>b. Can BEIS confirm/be more specific on timing for confirmation of the shortlist?</strong></p>

<p>As stated above, shortlisted Projects will be announced in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>c. How long does BEIS anticipate the agreeing an offer stage will take?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS expects the agreeing an offer stage to take place from early to mid-2023, with the aim to award contracts from July 2023.</p>

<p><strong>d. When does BEIS anticipate confirming that the specified FID and COD dates are no longer a requirement and can be subject to discussion with BEIS and re-forecasting, if the contracts cannot be finalized by July 2023?</strong></p>

<p>The requirement for the COD no later than the end of 2025 is dependent on the signing of contracts from July 2023 – if signing of contracts is delayed beyond July 2023 due to reasons outside the Applicant’s control, for example due to delays to the Agreeing an Offer process, government reserves the right to allow the COD to be extended upon receiving an applicant’s request.    BEIS’ decision would be dependent on the timing of such request and will be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><strong>e. If projects are not taken forward in this first application phase, will the application be transferred into the 2023 ‘second’ application phase?&nbsp; What will be done to streamline the application process for both industry and government such that effort is not duplicated in the second phase?</strong></p>

<p>Government is aiming to open a similar process to this Electrolytic Allocation Round in 2023, for contract award in 2024. As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, government is aiming to move to price competitive allocation from 2025 onwards as soon as legislation and market conditions allow. BEIS’ assumption is that because criteria might change, a new application will be required for Projects that are unsuccessful in the 2022 HBM/NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round, this will be kept under review.</p>

<p><strong>f. Government defines COD in the eligibility criteria as being different from COD under the HBM.&nbsp; Can this be explained further?</strong></p>

<p>COD in the context of new build hydrogen production facilities for this joint allocation round means the date when the facility is commissioned and ready to commence operations. The LCHA will include a more detailed set of definitions related to the commissioning of the facility, for example “Operational Conditions Precedent”, “Start Date” and “Target Commissioning Window”. Please refer to the Indicative Heads of Terms for further details, noting that the Heads of Terms are preliminary and indicative only and the provisions set out therein are subject to further consideration and development by government.</p>

<p><strong>g. Has the duration of the Target Commissioning Window been confirmed?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>h. Will the TCW have a backstop of end of 2025, or if projects have a COD of December 2025 will the TCW be 12 months from then (if TCW duration is 12 months) i.e. Dec 2025 – Dec 2026?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>i. Can BEIS provide more info or detail on timeline for the second application phase window in 2026?</strong></p>

<p>The second joint allocation round is aimed to take place in 2023. For future allocation rounds, government may consider reviewing the eligibility and evaluation criteria and expects to set out a target COD for the 2023 allocation round by Q2 2023.</p>

<p><strong>j. Is there any benefit or credit, either through the additionality scoring or the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard, to having a physical connection to a renewable electricity source where additionality of the electricity source can’t otherwise be demonstrated?</strong></p>

<p>Demonstrating additionality of electricity source is not a mandatory requirement under the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard or as an eligibility requirement for applicants to this allocation round. However, we recognise that Projects that can meet our principles for additionality of electricity source will be lowest emission from a systems perspective and may also support deployment of new build generation. Therefore, Projects that can provide clear and credible evidence that they are using electricity sources deemed additional according to the hierarchy of principles set out in 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document, will be able to receive credit. The specific evidence requirements that will be considered at assessment stage to prove these principles have been met are outlined in the guidance.</p>

<p><strong>k. Can any Capex expenditure incurred before signing a contract be claimed through the HBM or NZHF funding, noting that if a contract is not achieved that there will be no obligation on government to pay any capex already incurred?</strong></p>

<p>Government will not be responsible for, nor make any commitment in respect of, costs incurred before the signature of any LCHA or Grant Offer Letter.</p>

<p><strong>l. Can any Devex expenditure incurred before signing a contract be claimed through the HBM or NZHF funding, noting that if a contract is not achieved that there will be no obligation on government to pay any capex already incurred?</strong></p>

<p>As above, Government will not be responsible for, nor make any commitment in respect of, costs incurred before the signature of any LCHA or Grant Offer Letter.</p>

<h2>Briefing event, 27 July  2022: clarification questions</h2>

<p><strong>BE1. What is the total amount of funding that has been earmarked for HBM? Annual breakdown and total funding through the length of the contract.</strong></p>

<p>HBM funding for projects operational before 2025 will be provided by up to £100m of taxpayer funding that was committed through the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme in the Net Zero Strategy. It is intended that all HBM support will be levy funded from 2025 onwards, subject to consultation and Parliamentary approval of any legislation required.</p>

<p>For this allocation round, we intend to publish a Budget Notice alongside the shortlist announcement in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE2. Will BEIS be announcing a list of eligible projects and if so, when?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS does not intend to announce a list of eligible projects, those projects that are found to be ineligible will be informed by BEIS that they will not be taken forward to the evaluation stage.. However, BEIS does intend to announce a list of shortlisted projects (those taken through to the Agreeing an Offer stage) in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE3. Is an indicative strike price needed before the shortlisting process?</strong></p>

<p>No, an indicative strike price is not needed before the shortlisting process. Projects will be assessed against the six evaluation criteria set out in section 4 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE4. Can you explain a bit more about how BEIS will assess whether projects are “materially different”?</strong></p>

<p>For the 2022 HBM/ NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round, a business can lead on up to four applications, which must be materially different, and can be included as a collaborator, or project partner, in a further four applications. This approach will be reviewed, and future allocation rounds may allow businesses to lead on and be included as a collaborator on more than four applications.</p>

<p>Material difference will be assessed based on a number of factors such as project size, technology, end use, and location.</p>

<p><strong>BE5. Will the qualifying offtakers be updated as the hydrogen economy expands?</strong></p>

<p>Government will consider the need to review its position on qualifying offtakers in future, both for existing contracts and future allocation rounds.</p>

<p><strong>BE6. If a project is less than 5MW can we still apply for the fund?</strong></p>

<p>No, for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output), on a High Heating Value (HHV) basis. This will ensure government is using its limited resources on assessing projects which can contribute to helping government meet its commitments on having 1GW of electrolytic hydrogen in operation or construction by 2025 and 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030.</p>

<p><strong>BE7. Can a company applying for HBM be its own offtaker?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, subject to compliance with subsidy control rules and potential adjustments to the hydrogen business model, own consumption is allowed under the HBM, as detailed on page 14 of the government response to consultation on a business model for low carbon hydrogen. This offtake must be eligible under the HBM as detailed in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE8. We don’t seem to have visibility on how the HBM support will work in practice and over what period. Can this be explained please?</strong></p>

<p>BEIS expects the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement to have a contract term between 10 and 15 years. This reflects: (i) the precedents set by the low carbon electricity CfD and CCUS Programme HoTs; (ii) the potential time for this nascent hydrogen market to develop; and (iii) a balance between providing price support certainty for Producers for a proportionate and reasonable period, whilst not locking in production pathways for the long term.</p>

<p>For further information on how the HBM will work in practice, including details of its operational period, please refer to the government response to the consultation on a low carbon hydrogen business model and the Indicative Heads of Terms document.</p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team continues to work to finalise the contract that successful projects will receive and will set out further detail on the HBM design in due course. The HBM team are aiming to finalise the HBM in 2022 with a view to awarding the first HBM contracts from next year.</p>

<p><strong>BE9. I have an application in for a 5MW electrolyser under NZHF strand 1. Should I also be applying for this funding stream?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the guidance, Projects will only be able to apply to one strand per project at any one time and cannot switch between strands once they’ve been awarded funding for a project.</p>

<p>Projects applying for strand 1 (April – June 2022) will not be eligible to apply for strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as their strand 1 application will still be live during the time of this strand 3 application window. These projects may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round.</p>

<p>The rationale for this approach is that as set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that FEED is at an advanced stage.</p>

<p>Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July – 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the strand 3 application window closes.</p>

<p>Strand 1 of the NZHF aims to grow the pipeline of projects in the UK by providing development support for FEED and post-FEED studies, and we expect that projects supported through strand 1 will go on to apply for NZHF CAPEX and/or HBM support in future allocation rounds.</p>

<p>As such applicants will need to consider whether their project is able to progress without strand 1 development funding if they wish to apply for strand 3. If your project requires strand 1 development support, you may be able to apply for a future Joint Allocation Round. Alternatively, you may withdraw your Strand 1 application in order to submit an application for the 2022 HBM/NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round. This must be done before the deadline for the Expression of Interest submissions on 7 September 2022, as Projects must submit an EoI to be considered under this Electrolytic Allocation Round.</p>

<p><strong>BE10. How do you expect high energy prices to influence the difference between the hydrogen strike and reference prices, and how do you expect that the influence what BEIS can now achieve with the £100m that’s available?</strong></p>

<p>Price support will be provided through a variable premium price support model where the subsidy is the difference between a ‘strike price’ reflecting the cost of producing hydrogen and a ‘reference price’ reflecting the market value of hydrogen.</p>

<p>In the absence of a wholesale market price, the reference price is based on the producer’s achieved sales price, with a floor at the natural gas price, and a contractual mechanism to incentivise the producer to find the true value of hydrogen.</p>

<p>The amount of subsidy adjusts through the reference price. If natural gas prices rise, the level of government support reduces, and if they fall, the level of support rises.</p>

<p>The budget of up to £100m is to cover the period up to 2025. The business model, via the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme, will provide annual revenue support for the duration of the business model contract awarded to each project.</p>

<p><strong>BE11. What COD date will a Strand 3 allocation round running summer 2023 require?</strong></p>

<p>For future allocation rounds, government will consider reviewing the eligibility and evaluation criteria and expects to set out a target COD for the 2023 allocation round by Q2 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE12. Please can you provide a contact for progressing an RTFO qualification in-principle letter?</strong></p>

<p>DfT do not require the full registration for the RTFO to get an in-principle assessment letter.</p>

<p>Email: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk">rtfo-compliance@dft.gov.uk</a> with a request for an in-principle assessment letter for more information please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation</a> .</p>

<p><strong>BE13. In terms of the offtake agreement, we note that this has to be agreed before submission of the application but the LCHA will only be entered into a later stage. What factors should be taken into account when agreeing the Offtake Agreement to make its terms compliant?</strong></p>

<p>Section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document provides applicants with the information needed to ensure the terms of their Offtake Agreement are compliant with the LCHA.</p>

<p><strong>BE14. Can you please confirm whether the 5MW requirement refers to the capacity of the electrolyser or to volume of hydrogen produced?</strong></p>

<p>Government has set a minimum production capacity of 5MW (MW output) for this allocation round, on a High Heating Value (HHV) basis. For the avoidance of doubt, this should not be read as the megawatts input electricity capacity of the electrolyser.</p>

<p><strong>BE15. Will the assessment criteria be carried forward into competitive auction rounds in later years? If so, how will that work? Or will it just be based on cost at that point?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, government is aiming to move to price competitive allocation from 2025 onwards as soon as legislation and market conditions allow. These future rounds may include scope for non-CCUS, non-solely electrolytic technologies for hydrogen production such as biomass. BEIS has not yet laid out eligibility and evaluation criteria for these rounds but will do so in future.</p>

<p><strong>BE16. Will the target commissioning window have an end date of Dec 2025?</strong></p>

<p>The Hydrogen Business Model team are currently developing the detailed policy position on the duration of the Target Commissioning Window and will provide an update in due course.</p>

<p><strong>BE17. Will projects targeting mobility offtake be eligible for HBM support with a strike price reflecting the price of dispensed hydrogen for use in mobility applications, as long as the mobility offtaker is not also in receipt of RTFO support? i.e does BEIS have a view on how projects will be scored if they are seeking to use the HBM as an alternative to the RTFO to support mobility projects?</strong></p>

<p>Mobility applications are not included within the list of non-qualifying offtakers for this Electrolytic Allocation Round, as set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document. The existence of alternative support is not a valid consideration in the process of project selection.</p>

<p>Section 4.3 of the Application Guidance document sets out how BEIS may apply a portfolio approach if the allocation round is oversubscribed, and there is considered to be an imbalance in the overall portfolio, with further information on how this may be applied to ensure diversity of end use and electricity source/operating model. The use of portfolio factors is aimed at addressing excessive risk concentration or homogeneity that may arise from a portfolio constructed only of the highest scoring standalone Projects.</p>

<p><strong>BE18. Will there be a standard approach to calculating jobs released to ensure parity between project calculations?</strong></p>

<p>Evaluation against the Economic Benefits criterion will be undertaken on the basis of information provided through the Economic Benefits Template (Annex C) and answers provided within the Project Application Form, alongside any associated supporting documentation.</p>

<p>The Economic Benefits Template is structured to allow Projects to provide data for both the direct and indirect jobs they expect to provide throughout Project development and operations. As with other criteria, the onus will be on the Project to provide sufficient supporting information and justification for any assumptions made, and assessors will be instructed to score accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>BE19. CAPEX costs for transport and storage are stated as excluded within the scope of supply of NZHF. Would this also apply to transport via a private pipeline from generation to a third party, e.g if h2 is generated on-site and sold over the fence to an offtaker.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, CAPEX costs for storage and transport are not included within scope of NZHF CAPEX funding under this Joint Allocation round. However, the HBM funding may include revenue support for small-scale hydrogen transport and storage. Any support will be negotiated on a project-by-project basis by taking several factors into account, including necessity, affordability and VfM for government. More specifically, and as set out in the HBM indicative Heads of Terms, this could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the CAPEX, but not OPEX, costs associated with small-scale hydrogen transport infrastructure, and</li>
  <li>the CAPEX and/or OPEX costs associated with small-scale storage infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BE20. With additionality so low, do you actually expect anyone to take on the additional costs and logistical issue for only 5%? Have BEIS basically given up on additionality?</strong></p>

<p>The weighting for the Additionality upholds the additionality principles set out in the consultation response to the LCHS, which sought to incentivise, but does not mandate, an additionality requirement around electricity source for electrolytic projects. The government recognises the benefits of additionality but understands that demonstrating additionality of electricity sources may not be achievable for some projects, and therefore have not made this a mandatory requirement to apply to this allocation round or applied a minimum score to this criterion.</p>

<p><strong>BE21. While capacity cannot be phased, can the input of renewable power be phased and still be eligible?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. More information on the additionality evaluation criterion can be found in section 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE22. Will external funding be scored more highly than on-balance sheet?</strong></p>

<p>No, Projects are not scored more highly for having one type of finance over another. In seeking to identify Projects which are most suited to deployment in the mid-2020s, government will place significant emphasis on the credibility and consistency of information provided. This will also be taken as evidence of the maturity of submissions. As set out in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document, Projects are scored on government’s confidence in the financial viability of the organisation and/or their ability to finance project.</p>

<p><strong>BE23. Can you clarify the significance of the different negotiation pathways you mentioned and what is the latest date you envisage more complex project pathways signing LCH agreements?</strong></p>

<p>Information on the structure of the Agreeing an Offer stage can be found in section 5.4 of the Application Guidance document. Government expects the Agreeing an Offer stage to take place from early to mid-2023. More information on this stage, including details of the respective pathways, will be set out when the shortlist is announced in early 2023.</p>

<p><strong>BE24. For the demonstration of qualified offtaker, non-binding agreements like MoU will suffice for making the application or are binding agreements required?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 4.2.1 of the Application Guidance document, Projects are expected to provide an agreement or evidence of progress towards an agreement with hydrogen offtakers. For example, this could be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a letter of intent or provisional agreement with offtakers</li>
  <li>Memoranda of Understanding, collaboration agreements or draft Heads of Terms being in place between the hydrogen producer and its proposed offtakers</li>
  <li>Government recognises that the level of commitment in place between an early-stage Project and its partners may naturally vary depending on the Project’s stage of development so any evidence of formal and informal agreements and discussions would be welcome</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BE25. Regarding the COD by 2025, apart from the delay in contract signature, can we get an extension on COD and still be eligible for funding.</strong></p>

<p>Applicants will need to demonstrate within their submission that they meet the “Commercial Operation Date (COD) by end of 2025” eligibility criterion. As set out in section 3.2 of the Application Guidance document, the requirement for the COD no later than the end of 2025 is dependent on the signing of contracts from July 2023 – if signing of contracts is delayed beyond July 2023 due to reasons outside the Applicants control, for example due to delays to the Agreeing an Offer process, government reserves the right to allow the COD to be extended upon receiving an applicant’s request.</p>

<p><strong>BE26. The funding applies to hydrogen production facilities in the UK, does the off-taker have to be located in UK or can they be for overseas?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 3.6 of the Application Guidance document, and as set out in the response to the HBM consultation, given the primary objective of the HBM is to kickstart the UK’s low carbon hydrogen economy, volumes of hydrogen intended for export will not be eligible for revenue support.</p>

<p><strong>BE27. You state an eligibility criterion that technology must be at TRL 7 but also have a bid evaluation criteria to progress technological development and innovation – these seem at odds with each other?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 3.3 of the Application Guidance document, to be eligible to apply to this Electrolytic Allocation Round projects must be using core production technology that has been tested in a commercial environment, with a TRL of 7 or more. This criterion ensures our funding picks up where BEIS innovation funding ends. In this context, the core production technology refers to the electrolyser, and government believes that both PEM and Alkaline electrolysers meet this requirement.</p>

<p>The Market Development &amp; Learning evaluation criterion asks Projects to demonstrate how their hydrogen production plans and associated infrastructure contribute to the development of a hydrogen market. Government wants Projects to demonstrate how they will create and share knowledge from early hydrogen deployment and promote innovations.</p>

<p><strong>BE28. Can a non-UK electrolysis manufacturer be involved in projects as long as a Project Representative is a UK based company?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there is no eligibility requirement about the Project having a UK based electrolyser supplier. Projects must however meet the eligibility criterion of “Project plant located entirely in the United Kingdom and the Project Representative’s business being registered in the UK”.</p>

<p><strong>BE29. What is the requirement for additionality for the HBM, is it true the same as outlined whereby meeting low-carbon hydrogen standard is the only requirement noting scoring favours additionality?</strong></p>

<p>Demonstrating additionality of electricity source is not a mandatory requirement under the Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard or as an eligibility requirement for applicants to this allocation round.</p>

<p>However, projects that can provide clear and credible evidence that they are using electricity sources deemed additional according to the hierarchy of principles set out in 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document, will be able to receive credit. The specific evidence requirements that will be considered at assessment stage to prove these principles have been met are outlined in section 4.2.6 of the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE30. Can you please confirm when answers to any clarification questions will be published? (i.e will answers be provided on a rolling basis before the submission deadline?)</strong></p>

<p>Answers to clarification questions will be posted on a rolling basis on gov.uk throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>BE31. Projects with a COD in 2025 are likely to still be in pre-FEED stages at the time of application. How will BEIS deal with uncertainty in the project costs at this stage?</strong></p>

<p>As set out in section 5.1 of the Application Guidance document, projects applying for strand 3 support through the joint allocation round (final submission due by 12 October 2022), if shortlisted, will need to demonstrate that FEED is at an advanced stage. Therefore, projects will not be able to apply for strand 1 (April – June 2022), and then also apply to strand 3 in the first allocation round (open for applications 20 July– 12 October 2022) as they would not have received their strand 1 support by the time the 2022 HBM/NZHF Electrolytic Allocation Round closes.</p>

<p>In seeking to identify Projects which are most suited to deployment in the mid-2020s, government will place significant emphasis on the credibility and consistency of information provided. This will also be taken as evidence of the maturity of submissions.</p>

<p>With this in mind, government would advise Project Representatives to ensure that all Projections made in their Project Application Form and wider submission (including deployment dates, emissions volumes, and cost profiles) are robust and properly supported by the accompanying documentation that they submit.</p>

<p><strong>BE32. Is it the case that projects financially supported by NZHF strand 3 cannot also receive the financial benefit of the RTFO directly? However, offtakers from the HBM supported project will be able to receive the value from RTFCs?</strong></p>

<p>It is not the case that projects that receive strand 3 support from the Electrolytic Allocation Round cannot receive the benefit of the RTFO also.</p>

<p>As set out in Section 2.2 of the Application Guidance document, government recognises that some projects may be considering revenue support through both the Hydrogen Business Model and the RTFO. Subject to compliance with subsidy control principles and the final design of the HBM, producers in receipt of Hydrogen Business Model support will be allowed to participate in the RTFO. Volumes produced will be allowed to be claimed under the RTFO, subject to meeting the RTFO’s eligibility criteria, but claiming under both the HBM and RTFO for the same volumes of hydrogen will not be permitted. Work is ongoing to develop administrative arrangements and enforcement regime enabling dual participation and guarding against producers claiming under both schemes for the same costs.</p>

<p><strong>BE33. When there are two companies working together, what company should respond to the company information sector?</strong></p>

<p>In the context for the Electrolytic Allocation Round, the Project Representative is the lead applicant, responsible for submitting the Expression of Interest form and the final submission.</p>

<p>The Project Representative is expected to be from the primary or partner organisation responsible for Project development, which must be a legal entity.</p>

<p><strong>BE34. Annex G (EA signposting for Hydrogen Projects) is not available on the gov website for download. Is there some other way to access this, or is this just referencing the Hydrogen Emissions Calculator?</strong></p>

<p>A correction has been made to the Project Application Form, where the previously labelled Annex G now refers to Appendix A in the Application Guidance document.</p>

<p><strong>BE35. Can BEIS comment further on the subsidy control measures envisaged, particularly around interaction with renewable generation subsidies?</strong></p>

<p>We are considering the interactions with renewable electricity generation subsidies in developing the commercial aspects of the HBM, including with respect to subsidy control. Any decision to award support will be made subject to government being comfortable with the application of subsidy control requirements. See further information: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/complying-with-the-uks-international-obligations-on-subsidy-control-guidance-for-public-authorities/technical-guidance-on-the-uks-international-subsidy-control-commitments">Complying with the UK’s international obligations on subsidy control guidance for public authorities / technical guidance on the UK’s international subsidy control commitments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BE36. Will the Clarification Questions be posted weekly, if so when each week do you expect to do this?</strong></p>

<p>Answers to the clarification questions will be posted on a rolling basis throughout the competition window. The deadline for the submission of clarification questions is 23:59 on 28 September 2022, ahead of the submission window closing on 12 October 2022.</p>

<p><strong>BE37. How would BEIS deal with an application that answers ‘no’ to one of the eligibility criteria? Does that immediately scrap the application or would BEIS consider the application if prior contact has been made?</strong></p>

<p>An answer in the eligibility section of the Online Application Form that fails to meet the required eligibility criteria will result in the Project Representative being unable to proceed with all subsequent sections.</p>

<p><strong>BE38. Can the CAPEX stated in the EOI be updated for the final submission?</strong></p>

<p>Further information on the EoI process can be found on page 16 of the Application Guidance.</p>

<p>Applicants are asked to confirm in the EoI that to the best of their knowledge they meet the mandatory eligibility criteria. Government may provide feedback if it appears your Project is unlikely to meet the criteria.</p>

<p>EoI answers are considered as indicative only and not as firm responses. Projects will not be prevented from making a full application based on the information provided in the EoI.</p>

<p>The final submission which will be due by 12 October will require you to provide supporting evidence to prove you meet the eligibility criteria. Applications which meet the eligibility criteria and the minimum deliverability score will continue to the evaluation stage where they will be assessed against a set of defined evaluation criteria.</p>
