<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The Vivaldi 3 study, conducted by the University of Birmingham in collaboration with University College London, is an integral part of the Vivaldi project which was set up in June 2020 to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection outcomes and immunity in residents and staff in care homes in England.</p>

<p>For this paper, researchers studied blood samples from 202 staff and 286 residents in care homes to investigate their antibody and cellular immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination. Blood sampling was carried out between December 2020 and June 2021.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Antibody responses following dual vaccination in both staff (younger than 65 years) and residents (older than 65 years) with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were strong and similar across all age groups.</p>

<p>Antibody responses were just over 8 times (8.1) lower in elderly residents who had not had prior natural SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those with previous infection. In contrast these values were just under 2 and a half times (2.4) lower in care home staff, suggesting that younger age may help to overcome this effect.<br>
This means that care home residents without prior infection had just over 2 and a half times (2.6) lower antibody response than the younger staff.</p>

<p>Cellular immunity is also thought to be important in controlling disease severity. Spike-specific T cell responses were seen to be 52% lower in residents without prior natural infection compared to those who had previously had a natural infection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Care home residents and staff who have previously contracted and survived COVID-19 develop much stronger and higher antibody and cellular immune responses following 2 doses of vaccination than those without prior natural infection.</p>

<p>The findings emphasise the need for all care home residents to increase their immunity protection through receiving their 2 primary vaccine doses and third booster vaccines.</p>
