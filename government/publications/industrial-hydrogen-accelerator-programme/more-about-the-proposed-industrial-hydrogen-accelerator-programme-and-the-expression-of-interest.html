<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator competition is a proposed innovation funding programme to support the demonstration of end-to-end industrial fuel switching to hydrogen. It aims to prove the feasibility and reduce the costs and risks of hydrogen fuel switching systems. The scope would include the full technology chain, from hydrogen generation and delivery infrastructure through to industrial end-use, including the integration of the components in a single project.</p>

<p>The projects would develop knowledge on the design and implementation of hydrogen systems for industry to showcase ‘first-of-a-kind’ blueprints to enable accelerated deployment in the late 2020s and support the UK’s 2030 5GW hydrogen production ambition.</p>

<p>The funding would aim to catalyse the hydrogen economy through enabling early industrial movers. It would further aim to develop stakeholder knowledge, confidence and awareness. The resulting evidence would be vital to kickstart industrial hydrogen fuel switching deployment, supporting the UK’s leading global role in the sector.</p>

<p>The Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme is proposed to form part of <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr>’ £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, announced in the Prime Minister’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution/title">10 Point Plan</a> in autumn 2020. This innovation portfolio runs until March 2025 and aims to accelerate the commercialisation of innovative clean energy technologies and processes through the 2020s and 2030s.</p>

<h2>Scope of the Call</h2>

<p>The Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator is proposed to support projects through providing funding for demonstrators and, where needed, feasibility studies.</p>

<p>The feasibility studies would explore how systems could be designed and provide information on the technical requirements and costs. The demonstration projects would construct end-to-end industrial hydrogen systems, from hydrogen production to end-use, to prove their feasibility and provide further evidence on the real-world performance and costs.</p>

<p>The structure of the programme is subject to change, but the initial design is (see Figure 1):</p>

<h3>Stream 1: Demonstration – Grant</h3>

<p>A grant funding competition for demonstration projects; applicants would need to provide match funding.</p>

<h3>Stream 2A: Feasibility – <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr>
</h3>

<p>An <abbr title="Small Business Research Initiative">SBRI</abbr> competition for feasibility studies. No match funding required.</p>

<h3>Stream 2B: Demonstration – Grant</h3>

<p>A grant funding competition for demonstration projects; applicants would need to provide match funding. Open only to projects who have completed feasibility studies in Stream 2A.</p>

<h2>Expression of Interest</h2>

<p><strong>The purpose of this <abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr> is to raise early awareness of the proposed competition and to gauge the level of interest</strong>, enabling <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to <strong>gain a better understanding of the range of potential applicants</strong>.</p>

<p>If you may be interested in applying to this competition, please complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/IndustrialHydrogenAcceleratorEOI/" rel="external"><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme <abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr> Form</a> to express interest. We will then ensure you are notified once further details are available. Further updates will be published on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/b19b0a9f-653c-44db-9ec9-414ab8a8b807" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-hydrogen-accelerator-programme">Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator page</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Organisations will not be prejudiced by any response to this <abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr>, or failure to respond. This <abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr> does not formally signify the beginning of a procurement/ competition and does not constitute a commitment by <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to undertake any procurement/competition exercise. In the event that <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> decides to formally commence a procurement or call for proposals, a separate notice will be issued on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/b19b0a9f-653c-44db-9ec9-414ab8a8b807" rel="external">Contracts Finder</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-hydrogen-accelerator-programme">Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator page</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>A virtual <strong>Stakeholder Engagement Session</strong> is planned on 8 March 2022 10:00-12:00 to provide potential applicants with the opportunity to understand more about the proposed competition, to provide feedback on the design and to ask questions. Non-attendance at the Stakeholder Engagement Session does not preclude you from further involvement in any potential tender/competition process.</p>

<p>If you would like to attend, please <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/proposed-industrial-hydrogen-accelerator-programme-engagement-session-tickets-266806364017" rel="external">sign up to the virtual Stakeholder Engagement Session</a>, or you can provide your consent for <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> to contact you with updates on the registration process when completing the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/IndustrialHydrogenAcceleratorEOI/" rel="external"><abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr> Form</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage any comments on the proposed competition approach at the Stakeholder Engagement Session.</p>

<p>If you experience technical issues when completing the <abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> Industrial Hydrogen Accelerator Programme <abbr title="Expression of Interest">EOI</abbr> Form, please contact us by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:nzip.hydrogen@beis.gov.uk">nzip.hydrogen@beis.gov.uk</a>.</p>
