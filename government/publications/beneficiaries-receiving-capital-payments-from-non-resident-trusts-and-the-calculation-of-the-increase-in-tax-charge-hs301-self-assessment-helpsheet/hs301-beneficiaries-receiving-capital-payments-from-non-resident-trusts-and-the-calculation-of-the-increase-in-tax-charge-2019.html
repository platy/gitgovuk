<p>This helpsheet gives you information to help you fill in box 52 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-capital-gains-summary-sa108">Capital Gains Tax summary</a> pages of your tax return. It explains how Capital Gains Tax (<abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr>) is chargeable on capital payments or benefits from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating trust, but it’s only an introduction.</p>

<p>The following instructions will show you how to complete the working sheet to arrive at a figure for box 52.</p>

<p>If you’re in any doubt about whether you’re liable to <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> on capital payments or benefits from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating trust, or about how the tax is calculated, ask HMRC or your tax adviser.</p>

<h2>Who should use this helpsheet</h2>
<p>Any person resident in the UK who has directly or indirectly benefited from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating settlement may be liable to <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> as a result. That person may also be liable to an increase in tax charge.</p>

<p>In this helpsheet the term ‘immigrating’ settlement or trust means one which is resident in the UK but either had been resident abroad previously or has had money or other assets transferred to it by a trust that still is abroad or had been abroad previously.</p>

<p>You can find more information on what is a non-resident trust or a dual resident trust
and whether you’re liable to tax on the capital gains of such a trust if you’re its settlor, in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-resident-trusts-and-capital-gains-tax-hs299-self-assessment-helpsheet">Helpsheet 299 Non-resident trusts and Capital Gains Tax</a>.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> is charged</h2>
<p><abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> may be due if you’ve received a capital payment or benefit from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating trust. The maximum amount chargeable is the total capital gains made by the non-resident or dual resident trustees, calculated as if they had been resident in the UK. Gains of overseas companies in which the trustees have invested may also be taken into account.</p>

<p>A benefit includes interest-free loans, loans at less than the official rate of interest, rent-free occupation of trust property or use of trust property at less than market rental.</p>

<p>If you’ve directly or indirectly received, or are treated as having received, capital or a benefit from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating trust, its value must be matched against capital gains made by the trustees and by any foreign private company in which they’ve invested. You may have received a capital payment from the trustees in an earlier tax year which has not been matched with trust gains. If the trustees make capital gains in the tax year 2018 to 2019 these earlier capital payments may be matched against these gains. If so, you’ll need to include them on your return as attributed gains for the tax year 2018 to 2019. The trustees or their tax advisers should be able to tell you whether there are capital gains and how those gains are matched with your receipts or benefits.</p>

<p>If attributed gains are chargeable in 2018 to 2019 you enter these gains in box 18 of your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-capital-gains-summary-sa108"><abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> summary</a> pages. You cannot set any personal losses against these gains.</p>

<p>If you’re non-UK domiciled read <a class="govuk-link" href="#nonUK-dom">If I am non-UK domiciled</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>James is UK resident and domiciled. He received a capital payment of £10,000 from a non-resident trust during the year ended 5 April 2019, but the trustees made gains of £20,000 in the year ended 5 April 2017 that have not yet been matched with payments made to, or benefits provided for, beneficiaries. <br><br> CGT is due for tax year ending 5 April 2019, on the £10,000 James received. The trustees have £10,000 worth of gains remaining, still to be matched.</p>
</div>

<h2>How to calculate the increase in tax</h2>
<p>Where the capital gains, which have been matched against the capital payment or benefit, were made in an earlier year you may have to pay extra tax. In the example above, James would have to pay an increased amount of tax to reflect the fact that the gain made by the trustees actually arose 2 years earlier. The ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#table">table of increase in tax</a>’ shows by what percentage the normal <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> bill is increased.</p>

<p>You should assume that the normal tax bill is calculated as if the gains deemed to arise to you from this source are the first slice of your total gains. So the benefit of your <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> annual exempt amount will be given against these gains.</p>

<p>Match the gain against the gains of the trust and any foreign private company involved and work out by how much your normal tax bill would be increased, using the working sheet.</p>

<p>If the matching is against gains arising in more than one of the periods listed in the table below, the normal tax bill should be apportioned proportionally and the appropriate percentages applied to the apportioned amounts. In case of difficulty <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/trusts">HMRC Trusts</a> will be pleased to help.</p>

<h2>If I’m non-UK domiciled</h2>
<p>From 6 April 2008 as a non-UK domiciled beneficiary, you can be chargeable to <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> where you have received a capital payment or benefit from a non-resident, dual resident or immigrating trust. You’ll only have a <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> charge if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you received the capital payment or benefit after 5 April 2008</li>
  <li>the gain made by the trustees or any foreign private company in which they’ve invested, matched against the capital payment or benefit, arose after 5 April 2008</li>
</ul>

<p>The trustees or their tax advisers should be able to tell you whether you could have a <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> charge.</p>

<p>From 6 April 2017 an individual may become deemed domiciled in the UK. The detail of the deemed domicile rules are outside the scope of this helpsheet, however an individual who is deemed domiciled in the UK will not be able to claim the remittance basis.</p>

<p>If there could be a Capital Gains Tax charge on you, then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you’re a remittance basis user the gain attributed to you’ll only be chargeable when the capital payment or benefit you received is received in, or remitted to, the UK – you can find more information on when something is remitted within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-residence-remittance-basis-etc-sa109">Residence, remittance basis etc notes</a>
</li>
  <li>if you’re not a remittance basis user the gain attributed to you’ll be chargeable to <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> when it’s attributed to you</li>
</ul>

<p>When a gain becomes chargeable to <abbr title="Capital Gains Tax">CGT</abbr> you should enter it at box 18 in your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-capital-gains-summary-sa108">Capital Gains Tax summary</a> pages.</p>
