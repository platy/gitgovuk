<p>Future of Work Review – Terms of Reference</p>

<h1>1. Purpose</h1>
<p>This review should aim to focus narrowly on a few selected areas of policy within the broader ambit of the key strategic issues regarding the future of work in this country. Understandably, government policy often focuses on the key short-term challenges facing the labour market, and we already have existing commitments to improve employment regulation, but with covid restrictions ending, post-Brexit opportunities opening up, and the Levelling Up White Paper to implement, now is the time to look afresh at how we should attempt to shape our future labour market.</p>

<h1>2. Objectives</h1>
<p>The review will need to:</p>

<p>a) Build on existing government commitments (including those made in response to the Matthew Taylor Review) to assess what the key questions to address on the future of work are as we look to build back better from the pandemic. It should then select a few of these to focus on, without attempting to provide detailed consideration of every future challenge.</p>

<p>b) Provide a more detailed assessment of selected issues, engaging widely with independent experts, academics, think tanks and relevant government departments and drawing on international comparisons where appropriate.</p>

<p>c) Based on this assessment, make recommendations to guide long-term, strategic policy making on the labour market.</p>

<h1>3. Scope</h1>
<p>This review will be conducted in two parts; a first phase which should produce a high-level assessment of the key strategic issues on the future of work. The second phase should then provide a more detailed assessment of selected areas of focus from the first phase. This should not attempt to answer every challenge that our future labour market is likely to face. Rather the reviewer should focus on areas where our policy thinking is least developed, where the least consensus exists, or where the size of the opportunity for change is the greatest.</p>

<p>In line with the direction of travel in policy making across government, the review should make best use of data including identifying gaps in our data and seeking to improve the data we collect. Tax rates are out of scope for this review. The review could consider the following, non-exhaustive, list of key policy questions/challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The importance of place and local labour markets in creating and facilitating access to good jobs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of automation and how quickly it is happening.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How we can build on the ‘good’ flexibility in our labour market and the gig economy, whilst ensuring sufficient protections are in place to prevent exploitative practices. And how we can do this in a way that encourages productivity and growth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>4. Stakeholder engagement</h1>
<p>The review will engage widely with experts on labour market policy, across government, academia and think tanks. It will seek views from DWP, BEIS, DfE, DCMS, DHSC and HMT Ministers and senior officials.</p>

<h1>5. Governance</h1>
<p>The review will be supported by Cabinet Office given the cross-cutting remit, with the No.10 Policy Unit closely involved at key points.</p>

<h1>6. Report and timing</h1>
<p>The reviewer will be tasked with conducting their review over spring and summer 2022, before evaluating their findings and submitting a written report, including their recommendations, to the Prime Minister.</p>
