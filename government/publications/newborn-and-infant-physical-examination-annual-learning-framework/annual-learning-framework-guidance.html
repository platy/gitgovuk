<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Overview</h2>

<p>The NHS Newborn and Infant Physical Examination (<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr>) screening programme has produced the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> annual learning framework to support <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioners undertaking the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> newborn screening examination, to record and maintain their knowledge, understanding and skills in <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening.</p>

<p><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioners should complete the annual learning framework to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demonstrate evidence of lifelong learning and continuing professional development</li>
  <li>keep up to date with national <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> programme standards, clinical guidance and programme changes</li>
  <li>enable local providers to demonstrate quality assurance across their <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme</li>
  <li>promote consistency in practice across all disciplines (medical, midwifery and nursing)</li>
</ul>

<p>The annual learning framework is intended to be used by qualified <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> practitioners as defined in section 12 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-handbook"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme handbook</a> and a nominated confirmer. It is not a requirement for the nominated confirmer to be <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> qualified due to the nature of the framework, but <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> trained colleagues can also fulfil this role. The tool may also be used by <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> practitioners in primary care undertaking the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> newborn screening examination.</p>

<p>Further information on the requirements and expectations of each of these roles is provided in the ‘requirements and expectations’ section of this guidance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Recommendations</h2>

<p>The following 3 elements of the framework are recommended to be completed annually:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/nhs-screening-programmes/" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> e-learning module</a></li>
  <li>Discussion of national standards, clinical pathways, training and education resources</li>
  <li>attendance at a local <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> update session</li>
</ul>

<p>The following elements are recommended. However, the requirement to complete these, or the frequency of completion, can be determined by local agreement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> working in partnership: visits to specialist clinics or multidisciplinary discussions or meetings</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> reflection: reflective discussion or personal reflective account</li>
</ul>

<p>Components of the framework can be completed throughout the year as opportunities arise. However, a final sign off should be arranged to review the evidence within the framework and acknowledge that local requirements have been met.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Requirements and expectations</h2>

<p>This section sets out the requirements and expectations for qualified <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioners and confirmers.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Annual learning framework components</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>
<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> e-learning module (recommended annually)</h3>

<p>The NHS <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/nhs-screening-programmes/" rel="external"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> e-learning module</a> is aimed at health care professionals who undertake <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening in the NHS in England, and have qualified as a <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> practitioner (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-handbook"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme handbook</a> for more information on the requirements to be a <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> practitioner).</p>

<p>It covers the 4 screening elements of the physical examination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>eyes</li>
  <li>heart</li>
  <li>hips</li>
  <li>testes (males)</li>
</ul>

<p>Completion of the e-learning module should be annual.</p>

<p>As a useful addition to formal training, the module uses film and animation to illustrate screening pathways and good clinical practice.</p>

<p>You must register on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/" rel="external">e-Learning for Healthcare</a> to access the module.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>National standards, clinical pathways, training and education resources (recommended annually)</h3>

<p>The checklist provided within the framework can be used to ensure that the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioner has good working knowledge of the wider <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-standards/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-standards-valid-for-data-collected-from-1-april-2021"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme standards</a> and associated key performance indicators (<abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>)</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening pathways (national)</a> including those for eye, heart, hips and testes</li>
  <li>referral pathways (local)</li>
  <li>additional resources including:
    <ul>
      <li>‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening-tests-for-you-and-your-baby">Screening tests for you and your baby’</a>
</li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/screening-tests-for-you-and-your-baby-babies-in-special-care-units">‘Screening tests for you and your baby: babies in special care units’</a></li>
      <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme handbook</a>
</li>
      <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://nipe.training.nps-s4h.com/s4n/nhsbaby/" rel="external">S4N training site</a></li>
      <li>S4N national IT system (training on all aspects of the system should be provided locally by a cascade trainer, <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> lead or screening midwife)</li>
      <li>any local standard operating procedures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Screening practitioners should be familiar with accessing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-overview">national programme information</a> in order to keep up to date with programme changes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>Attendance at local <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> update session (recommended annually)</h3>

<p>This section of the framework should be used to record attendance at a local <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> update session, which is recommended annually in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-programme-handbook/newborn-and-infant-physical-examination-screening-programme-handbook"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme handbook</a>.</p>

<p>It can also be used to record other <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr>-related study days or self-directed learning as evidence of continuing professional development. Examples of what could be documented include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attendance at local <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> annual updates (recommended annually) – to include theoretical and/or practical aspects of the examination</li>
  <li>attendance at local, regional or national meetings in relation to the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme</li>
  <li>attendance at SMaRT4NIPE (S4N) national IT system training or update sessions</li>
  <li>self-directed research or reading in relation to <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr>
</li>
  <li>sessions arranged with the local screening coordinator to gain more insight and understanding of the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> programme standards, <abbr title="key performance indicators">KPIs</abbr>, data gathering or failsafe processes</li>
  <li>participation in <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> audit – including local audits and/or the national <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nipe-checks-and-audits-to-improve-quality-and-reduce-risks"><abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme checks and audit document</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>
<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> working in partnership: visits to specialist clinics or multidisciplinary discussions or meetings (recommended)</h3>

<p>Safe and efficient referral pathways into local specialist care following screen positive findings are essential to the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme.</p>

<p>Successful pathways depend on effective multidisciplinary working and effective inter-departmental communication. This section of the framework can be used to support local relationships and to help <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioners develop a wider overview of the screening programme beyond the examination itself. This includes the importance of ensuring a referral outcome is recorded (where appropriate) to close the screening loop.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioner can document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visits to specialist clinics in relation to the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screen including hip ultrasound, paediatric cardiology clinic, paediatric ophthalmology clinic and neonatal consultant follow-up clinics</li>
  <li>attendance at local screening operational boards where issues relating to the local <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening programme are discussed</li>
  <li>involvement in multidisciplinary discussions or meetings in relation to findings from the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screen</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span>
<abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> reflection: reflective discussion or personal reflective account (recommended)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> annual learning framework provides an opportunity for <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioners to complete an annual reflection in relation to a <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screen they have completed.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Nursing and Midwifery Council">NMC</abbr>, the <abbr title="General Medical Council">GMC</abbr> and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (<abbr title="Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health">RCPCH</abbr>) recognise the importance of reflective practice in identifying gaps in knowledge or skills and preventing similar issues or incidents from happening again.</p>

<p>Themes from the <abbr title="Nursing and Midwifery Council">NMC</abbr> documents have been used in the reflection section of the framework, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>describing the event</li>
  <li>identifying what the practitioner would change or improve next time</li>
  <li>identifying learning points from the experience</li>
</ul>

<p>An opportunity for the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioner to recognise what they have done well is also included, as this can be an important step in identifying and embedding good practice. This may be a result of personal reflection or based on feedback from other people (for example, a peer reviewer highlighting good practice)</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Annual final sign-off</h2>

<p>The annual final sign-off should be used as an opportunity for the <abbr title="newborn and infant physical examination">NIPE</abbr> screening practitioner and confirmer to review the evidence within the framework and acknowledge that the annual recommendations, plus any local requirements, have been met.</p>

<p>Any matters which are unresolved or require further escalation should be dealt with locally as agreed by the organisation.</p>
