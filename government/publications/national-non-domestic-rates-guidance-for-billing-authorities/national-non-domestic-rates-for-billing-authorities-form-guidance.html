<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>These instructions are to help billing authorities who are implementing the new national non-domestic rates (NNDR) payment process for local authority maintained schools and academies. The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will pay NNDR bills directly to billing authorities on behalf of local authority maintained schools and academies.</p>

<p>Further information on this change is at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-non-domestic-rates-guidance-for-billing-authorities/change-to-the-business-rates-payment-process-for-schools-guidance-for-billing-authorities">changes to the payment process of schools’ business rates</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Eligibility to claim</h2>

<p>The deadline for billing authorities to confirm they were implementing the new NNDR payment process was 21 February 2022.</p>

<p>If you did not confirm to ESFA your intention to implement the new payment process, you should continue to bill your maintained schools and academies directly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Eligible schools</h3>

<p>All local authority maintained schools and academies, including 16 to 19 academies that are not further education (FE) institutions, that deliver education will fall under the new process.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-non-domestic-rates-guidance-for-billing-authorities">schools by billing authority document</a> details the schools that fall under the remit of each billing authority.</p>

<h4>Maintained schools</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Local authority maintained schools</li>
  <li>Community schools</li>
  <li>Community special schools</li>
  <li>Foundation schools</li>
  <li>Foundation special schools</li>
  <li>Pupil referral units</li>
  <li>Voluntary aided schools</li>
  <li>Voluntary controlled schools</li>
</ol>

<h4>Academies:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-16 academy schools</li>
  <li>Special academies</li>
  <li>Alternative provision academies</li>
  <li>16 to 19 convertor academies</li>
  <li>16 to 19 sponsor led academies</li>
  <li>Special converter academies</li>
  <li>Free schools</li>
  <li>Free schools alternative provision</li>
  <li>Special free schools</li>
  <li>16 to 19 free schools</li>
  <li>Studio schools</li>
  <li>University technical colleges</li>
</ol>

<p>Early years or post-16-provider based provision, which is part of the overall school operation, will continue to be funded as they have been historically under the new process. Maintained nursery schools are out of scope of these changes.</p>

<p>Sixth forms which are part of secondary schools will also be funded as they have been historically under the new process.</p>

<p>Special schools and pupil referral units are in scope of the changes, however we would expect these to receive 100% relief for rates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>When to claim</h2>
<p>The deadline for submitting your claim is 11:59pm on 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>Claims can be amended up until the deadline. It will not be possible, under any circumstances, to grant any extensions to the deadline.</p>

</div>

<p>You’ll be presented with several pages with a series of questions which will ask you to complete information related to NNDR. All questions are mandatory.</p>

<p>After answering all the questions, you will be prompted to complete the required declarations before you can submit your form. Once you have submitted your form, an explanation on what happens next will follow.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Selecting ‘continue’ on each page will take you through the form.</p>
</div>

<h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your must only submit your data using this template, otherwise it will not be accepted.</p>
</div>

<h4>Matching schools to NNDR properties</h4>

<p>For this initial submission only, billing authorities will need to map ESFA’s schools’ data to their NNDR property data.</p>

<p>For maintained schools and academies, this can be done through a combination of matching postcodes and school names.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>There may be instances where your NNDR data contains more than one property for a single school.</p>

<p>Every educational provider in the UK has their own UK provider reference number (UKPRN). For most schools, there will be a one-to-one relationship between your account number for a property and the UKPRN for a school. However, as an example, where an academy has a split site, you will have two NNDR account numbers against the same UKPRN, this is acceptable. In these cases, simply present the numbers as two lines of data in your claims’ submission, each with the same UKPRN.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Marking relevant properties within your NNDR system</h3>

<p>This may be a two-step process. Depending on your requirements you may need to flag properties on your system with a new payment code, and/or add the properties to a new payment group.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Entering your data into the spreadsheet</h3>

<p>For each row/claim, enter the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the school (ratepayer/liable parties)</li>
  <li>property description</li>
  <li>property address line 1</li>
  <li>property postcode</li>
  <li>property reference number</li>
  <li>account reference number</li>
  <li>amount due/net liability</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not add, remove, or change the names of any columns as this will prevent us from processing your claim.</p>

<p>The name and address of the school you are claiming for, should match the equivalent ESFA data. However, we understand that there may be minor discrepancies, this is acceptable. ESFA is using this data to help double-check that the reference numbers and claims values have been placed in the correct row.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Including missing schools in your claim</h3>

<p>If there are schools relevant to your billing authority which are not in the spreadsheet provided by ESFA, you can add them to your claim following these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a new row on the template and add the property reference number, the NNDR account reference number and the claim amount</li>
  <li>find the UKPRN, official school name and address by using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments" rel="external">get information about schools (GIAS)</a>
</li>
  <li>add the UKPRN, name and address to the relevant row</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to contact ESFA about these properties. We’ll identify them during the claims’ validation process.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Properties you can or cannot claim for</h3>

<p>The following properties should not be included in your claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained nursery schools/early years settings that are not part of the overall school operation for example run by a private provider</li>
  <li>buildings used for non-educational purposes, for example, office and premises</li>
  <li>rented buildings</li>
  <li>FE institutions </li>
  <li>private schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Early years provision which is part of the overall school operation (for example, nursery classes in primary schools) will continue to be funded as previous years under the new payment process.</p>

<p>Sixth form provision within secondary schools will continue to be funded as previous years under the new payment process.</p>

<p>We have detailed some examples below that may help you determine whether you can submit a claim.</p>

<p>A school may have a playing field on a separate hereditament which is used by the school for educational purposes. The billing authority can submit a claim for this.</p>

<p>A school has an adjacent nursery, which is a separate hereditament from the main school. Maintained nursery schools are not part of the new policy change so no claim can be submitted by the billing authority. The billing authority and the school must make arrangements to cover this rates bill.</p>

<p>A school estate may be made up of a single hereditament which includes a nursery. As it’s not possible to separate this property for rates purposes and it has been previously funded by ESFA this will continue to happen after 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Where there is a clear requirement for a split the billing authority and school must work together to have this rated separately. This is not a new policy change.</p>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<p>You have a playing field on a separate hereditament, and it is used by the school, you can claim for the playing fields. If you have a nursery which is part of a larger primary school that is a separate hereditament from the main school, you cannot claim for the nursery.</p>

<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<p>You have a single hereditament which includes a primary school, a maintained nursery school and playing fields. As it is not possible to separate out the hereditament into those areas which are relevant to ESFA, and if these have been funded previously by EFSA you can continue to do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Declarations</h3>
<p>You will then be asked to check your answers before submitting your claims.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You will not be able to submit your claim without completing these declarations and to do that, you need to tick each box.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have completed this page, you will be able to select ‘submit’ to proceed.</p>

<p>You will see a message confirming that your claim has been submitted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Confirmation</h3>
<p>The final page confirms your claim has been submitted successfully. You’ll receive a unique reference number against your submission, followed by an explanation of what happens next.</p>

<p>You’ll receive an email which includes your claim reference number confirming successful submission of your claim.</p>

<p>We will then review your claim and may contact you if additional information is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Amend claim page</h3>
<p>Claims can be amended up until the deadline by selecting the link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nndrclaims.education.gov.uk/start/billingauthority" rel="external">claim form</a>. The deadline will not be extended. Once a new file is submitted, any previous submission(s) for this claim cycle will be overwritten. ESFA will only review the latest file.</p>

<p>You must resubmit the completed file with your full list of claims.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You will receive a new unique submission number for an amended claim.</p>
</div>

<h4>Making in-year adjustments</h4>

<p>The service is now open for any adjustments to rates claims. You can submit in-year adjustments for the financial year ending March 2023 using the existing claims service. Claims can be submitted up until 31 January 2023.</p>

<h4>Historical claims</h4>

<p>You will not be able to submit NNDR adjustments for historical claims for your local authority maintained schools using the claims service. Historic adjustments for 2021 to 2022 have been submitted by local authorities in the 2022 to 2023 authority proforma tool (APT).</p>

<p>Academies are able to submit changes to historical claims after April 2022 on the existing service for claims from April 2017. Academies will be able to do this until 31 January 2023. After 1 April 2023 the responsibility will move to billing authorities implementing the new NNDR payment process to pick up any changes to historical academy claims using the online portal.</p>

<p>Academies can submit claims for previously unclaimed years from 1 July 2022. This applies to years 2017 to 2018 to 2021 to 2022. The deadline for submitting claims is 31 January 2023.</p>

<p>ESFA will not, under any circumstances, accept claims for previously unclaimed years after this date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Enquiries</h2>
<p>If you’ve read this guidance and have any questions about the NNDR process or how to complete the online form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a>.</p>

<p>When completing the enquiry form, select ‘other’ as your query type.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>What happens next </h2>
<p>The information you have entered will be checked and validated against your funding allocation. 
  
Spot checks on receipted records will be carried out.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Payments</h2>
<p>Billing authorities will receive payments via Bacs.</p>

<p>Payments will be made by ESFA as a single lump sum to each billing authority.</p>

<p>All payments will be made on the last working day of the month so for new claims the first payments to billing authorities were made on 30 June 2022. The cut-off date for claim uploads for June payments was 22 May 2022.</p>

<p>Claims submitted after 1 July 2022 will be paid within 2 months.</p>

<p>Remittance is automatically sent when a payment is made.  We will provide a separate breakdown of individual payment amounts with their associated account reference numbers.</p>

<p>For reconciliation payments (adjustments to claims), the first payment will be made on 31 October 2022. This will be for positive adjustments only.</p>

<p>The final payment for adjustments (which will include recoveries) will be made on 31 March 2023.</p>

<p>The cut-off date for October payments is 11 September 2022 and 31 January 2023 for March payments.</p>
