<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>These instructions are to help billing authorities who are implementing the new national non-domestic rates (NNDR) payment process for local authority maintained schools and academies. Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will pay NNDR bills directly to billing authorities on behalf of local authority maintained schools and academies.</p>

<p>Further information on this change is at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-non-domestic-rates-guidance-for-billing-authorities/change-to-the-business-rates-payment-process-for-schools-guidance-for-billing-authorities">changes to the payment process of schools’ business rates</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Eligibility to claim</h2>
<p>The deadline for billing authorities to confirm they are implementing the new NNDR payment process was Monday 21 February 2022.</p>

<p>If you did not confirm to ESFA your intention to implement the new payment process, you should continue to bill your maintained schools and academies directly.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Eligible schools</h3>

<p>All local authority maintained schools and academies including 16 to 19 academies that are not further education (FE) institutions that deliver education will fall under the new process.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-non-domestic-rates-guidance-for-billing-authorities">schools by billing authority document</a> details the schools that fall under the remit of each billing authority.</p>

<h4>Maintained schools</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Local authority maintained schools</li>
  <li>Community school</li>
  <li>Community special school</li>
  <li>Foundation school</li>
  <li>Foundation special school</li>
  <li>Pupil referral unit</li>
  <li>Voluntary aided school</li>
  <li>Voluntary controlled school</li>
</ol>

<h4>Academies:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Pre 16 academy schools</li>
  <li>Special academies</li>
  <li>Alternative provision academies</li>
  <li>Academy 16 to 19 convertor</li>
  <li>Academy 16 to 19 sponsor led</li>
  <li>Academy special converter</li>
  <li>Free schools</li>
  <li>Free schools alternative provision</li>
  <li>Free schools special</li>
  <li>Free schools 16 to 19</li>
  <li>Studio schools</li>
  <li>UTC</li>
</ol>

<p>Early years or post-16-provider based provision which is part of the overall school operation will continue to be funded as they have been historically under the new process. Maintained nursery schools are out of scope of these changes.</p>

<p>Sixth forms which are part of secondary schools will also be funded as they have been historically under the new process.</p>

<p>Special schools and pupil referral units are in scope of the changes, however we would expect these to receive 100% relief for rates.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>When to claim</h2>
<p>The deadline for submitting your claim is 11:59pm on 22 May 2022.</p>

<p>Claims can be amended up until the deadline. Though it will not be possible to grant any extensions to the deadline, the service will be available at a later date for in-year changes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Accessing the claim form</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>There is no save facility on the form. Have all the information and evidence ready before starting a claim. If your claim form is opened for an extended period, you may lose any information entered and will need to sign in again.</p>
</div>

<p>You’ll be presented with several pages with series of questions which will ask you to complete information related to NNDR. All questions are mandatory.</p>

<p>After answering all the questions, you will be prompted to complete the required declarations before you can submit your form. Once submitted, an explanation on what happens next will follow.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Selecting ‘continue’ on each page will take you through the form.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Introduction page</h3>
<p>This page gives you an overview of NNDR claim form and confirms the claim deadline. Enter your credentials to sign in to DfE Sign-in pages. This is for authentication purposes only.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Your details</h3>
<p>This is a read-only page that confirms your details including the name of your billing authority when you log in to your DfE Sign-in account. Select one of the options that is most suitable to you if any of these details are incorrect. You can still make a submission.</p>

<p>We will also indicate if we already have a submission for your billing authority including the submission date and the time and person that submitted the claim.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Your must only submit your data using this template, otherwise it will not be accepted.</p>
</div>

<h4>Matching schools to NNDR properties</h4>

<p>For this initial submission only, billing authorities will need to map ESFA’s schools’ data to their NNDR property data.</p>

<p>For maintained schools and academies, this can be done through a combination of matching postcodes and school names.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>There may be instances where your NNDR data contains more than one property for a single school.</p>

<p>Every educational provider in the UK has their own UK provider reference number (UKPRN). For most schools, there will be a one-to-one relationship between your account number for a property and the UKPRN for a school. However, as an example, where an academy has a split site, you will have two NNDR account numbers against the same UKPRN, this is acceptable. In these cases, simply present the numbers as two lines of data in your claims’ submission, each with the same UKPRN.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Marking relevant properties within your NNDR system</h3>

<p>This may be a two-step process. Depending on your requirements you may need to flag properties on your system with a new payment code, and/or add the properties to a new payment group.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Entering your data into the spreadsheet</h3>

<p>For each row/claim, enter the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name of the school (ratepayer / liable parties).</li>
  <li>property description.</li>
  <li>property address line 1</li>
  <li>property postcode</li>
  <li>property reference number</li>
  <li>account reference number</li>
  <li>amount due / net liability</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not add, remove, or change the names of any columns as this will prevent us from processing your claim.</p>

<p>The name and address of the school you are claiming for, should match the equivalent ESFA data. However, we understand that there may be minor discrepancies, this is acceptable. ESFA is using this data to help double-check that the reference numbers and claims values have been placed in the correct row.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Including missing schools in your claim</h3>

<p>If there are schools relevant to your billing authority which are not in the spreadsheet provided by ESFA, you can add them to your claim following these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a new row on the template and add the property reference number, the NNDR account reference number and the claim amount.</li>
  <li>find the UKPRN, official school name and address by using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Search?SelectedTab=Establishments" rel="external">get information about schools (GIAS)</a>.</li>
  <li>add the UKPRN, name and address to the relevant row.</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to contact ESFA about these properties. We’ll identify them during the claims’ validation process.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Properties you can or can’t claim for</h3>

<p>The following properties should not be included in your claim:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maintained nursery schools/early years settings that are not part of the overall school operation for example run by a private provider</li>
  <li>buildings used for non-educational purposes, for example, office and premises</li>
  <li>rented buildings</li>
  <li>FE institutions </li>
  <li>private schools</li>
</ul>

<p>Early years provision which is part of the overall school operation (for example, nursery classes in primary schools) will continue to be funded as previous years under the new payment process.<br>
  
Sixth form provision within secondary schools will continue to be funded as previous years under the new payment process.</p>

<p>We have detailed some examples below that may help you determine whether you can submit a claim.</p>

<p>A school may have a playing field on a separate hereditament which is used by the school for educational purposes. The billing authority can submit a claim for this.</p>

<p>A school has an adjacent nursery, which is a separate hereditament from the main school. Maintained nursery schools are not part of the new policy change so no claim can be submitted by the billing authority. The billing authority and the school must make arrangements to cover this rates bill.</p>

<p>A school estate maybe made up of a single hereditament which includes a nursery. As it’s not possible to separate this property for rates purposes and it has been previously funded by ESFA this will continue to happen after 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>Where there is a clear requirement for a split the billing authority and school must work together to have this rated separately. This is not a new policy change.</p>

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

<p>You have a playing field on a separate hereditament, and it is used by the school, you can claim for the playing fields. If you have a nursery which is part of a larger primary school that is a separate hereditament from the main school, you cannot claim for the nursery.</p>

<h4>Example 2:</h4>

<p>You have a single hereditament which includes a primary school, a maintained nursery school and playing fields. As it is not possible to separate out the hereditament into those areas which are relevant to ESFA, and if these have been funded previously by EFSA you can continue to do so.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Declarations</h3>
<p>You will then be asked to check your answers before submitting your claims.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You will not be able to submit your claim without completing these declarations and to do that, you need to tick each box.</p>
</div>

<p>Once you have completed this page, you will be able to select ‘accept and send’ to submit your claims.</p>

<p>You will see a message confirming that your claim has been submitted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Confirmation</h3>
<p>The final page confirms your claim has been submitted successfully. You’ll receive a unique reference number against your submission, followed by an explanation of what happens next.</p>

<p>You’ll receive an email which includes your claim reference number confirming successful submission of your claim.</p>

<p>We will then review your claim and may contact you if additional information is required.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Amend claim page</h3>
<p>Claims can be amended up until the deadline by selecting the link to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://nndrclaims.education.gov.uk/start/billingauthority" rel="external">claim form</a>. The deadline will not be extended. Once a new file is submitted, any previous submission(s) for this claim cycle will be overwritten. ESFA will only review the latest file.</p>

<p>You must resubmit the completed file with your full list of claims.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You will receive a new unique submission number for an amended claim.</p>
</div>

<h4>Making in-year adjustments</h4>

<p>We are not currently accepting in-year adjustments.</p>

<p>ESFA will accept any adjustments to rates claims from July 2022. You’ll be able to submit in-year adjustments for the financial year ending March 2023 using the existing claims service.</p>

<h4>Historical claims</h4>

<p>You will not be able submit NNDR adjustments for historical claims using the claims service. Historic adjustments for 2021 to 2022 have been submitted by local authorities in the 2022 to 2023 authority proforma tool (APT).</p>

<p>Academies will be able to submit changes to historical claims after April 2022 on the existing service for claims from April 2017. Academies will be able to do this until 31 March 2023. After 1 April 2023 the responsibility will move to billing authorities implementing the new NNDR payment process to pick up any changes to historical academy claims using the online portal.</p>

<p>Academies will not be able to submit claims for previous unclaimed years from 1 April 2022.</p>
