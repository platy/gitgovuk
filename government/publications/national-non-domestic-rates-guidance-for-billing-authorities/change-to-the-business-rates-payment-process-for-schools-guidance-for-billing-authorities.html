<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance document is intended to support both billing authorities which are implementing the new national non-domestic rates (NNDR) payment process for state-funded schools, and for those billing authorities which have chosen to remain under the current process. We have contacted all billing authorities by email to confirm which payment process they intend to use. The new process will take effect from 1 April 2022. There will be no change to the current process during the current financial year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>Following an 8-week consultation, the government agreed to implement a new NNDR payment process from 1 April 2022.</p>

<p>The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), which is part of the Department for Education (DfE), will pay NNDR bills directly to billing authorities on behalf of local authority maintained schools and academies. This change includes 16 to 19 academies that are not further education (FE) institutions.</p>

<p>This change was announced alongside the publication of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-funding-formula-tables-for-schools-and-high-needs-2022-to-2023">schools notional national funding formula (NFF) allocations for 2022 to 2023</a> in July 2021. Further details were published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1011171/Changes_to_the_payment_process_of_schools__business_rates_-_government_consultation_response.pdf" rel="external">formal government consultation response</a> in August 2021 and subsequent communications via our stakeholders, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance &amp; Accountancy (CIPFA), Local Government Association (LGA) and Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing (DLUCH).</p>

<h2>Process for billing authorities implementing the new payment process</h2>

<p>Date of implementation: 1 April 2022</p>

<p>The online NNDR portal for billing authorities will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>open on 1 April 2022. Billing authorities must upload claims data (Excel template) for all local authority maintained schools and academies within their area for the financial year 2022 to 2023 by 22 May 2022. The first payment to billing authorities will be made on 30 June 2022</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reopen on 1 July 2022 for billing authorities to upload any in- year adjustments to bills. We refer to this as the reconciliation period. The upload facility to submit adjustments to bills will be open until 31 January 2023. Any 2022 to 2023 adjustments submitted after the 31 January 2023 deadline will be paid in the following claim year. Adjustments for 2022 to 2023 will only be able to be submitted until 31 January 2024</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow for reconciliation payments to be made to billing authorities at two points in the year: October 2022 and March 2023. The cut-off date is 11 September for October payments and 31 January for the end of year March payment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>October payments will be for positive in-year adjustments only, with the end of year (March) payments accounting for both positive adjustments and recovery of rates funding where this applies.</p>

<p>For any new schools that open during the year, billing authorities will upload the bill data for these schools during the reconciliation period. (1 July to 31 January).</p>

<p>Billing authorities will continue to issue bills to schools for information only and for local accounting purposes.</p>

<p>Billing authorities may be asked to provide further evidence to support NNDR claims for schools where there are significant variances compared to previous years. We anticipate setting tolerance thresholds that are in line with national revaluation figures to account for changes to schools’ rateable values, thereby avoiding the need for billing authorities to unnecessarily submit additional information to ESFA as evidence.</p>

<h2>NNDR funding (for education authorities)</h2>

<p>Local authority dedicated schools grant (DSG) allocations will include an amount for NNDR; however, the ESFA will not include NNDR funding in the DSG payments made to local authorities nor will local authorities issue NNDR funding to schools in their budgets.</p>

<p>We will issue further guidance on how to record NNDR in the end of year accounts.</p>

<p>Further technical guidance on how to submit a claim will be published later. We will advise you separately when this is published</p>

<h3>Eligible schools</h3>

<p>All local authority maintained schools and academies including 16 to 19 academies that are not FE institutions that deliver education will fall under the new process.</p>

<p>Billing authorities will receive a single lump sum payment by BACS on the last working day of the month.</p>

<p>To note: Where the ESFA requires further evidence or clarification on NNDR claims, we will aim to process these claims within two months of receipt.</p>

<h2>Handling of multi-use sites</h2>

<p>The ESFA will cover additional rates costs associated with buildings on a school site which are used to deliver education for pupils at the school (for example a sports hall that is used by pupils during lesson time and in the evenings by the wider community).</p>

<p>We will not cover the additional rates costs associated with buildings which are not used to deliver education for pupils at the school (for example, a children’s centre).</p>

<p>Where a school or the billing authority identifies that a split might be necessary, we advise them to contact the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) to get this assessment corrected.</p>

<p>The ESFA will continue to fund, as has been done historically, NNDR bills for those settings which are part of the overall school operation such as Early Years and Sixth form provision within the establishments listed above.</p>

<p>Billing authorities must only upload bill data that relates to the parts of a school site which is used to deliver education and exclude any other buildings.</p>

<p>Examples of these are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a school may have a playing field on a separate hereditament* which is used by the school for educational purposes. The billing authority can submit a claim for this</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a school has an adjacent nursery school which is a separate hereditament. Maintained nursery schools are not part of the new policy change so no claim can be submitted by the billing authority. The billing authority and the school must make arrangements to cover this rates bill</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a school estate may be made up of a single hereditament which includes a nursery school. As it is not possible to separate this property for rates purposes, and it has been previously funded by the ESFA, this will continue to happen after April 2022.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where there is a clear requirement for a split, the billing authority and school must work together to have this rated separately. This is not a new policy change</p>

<p>Where the ESFA pays a portion of the bill relating to buildings used for delivering education for pupils at the school, it will remain the schools’ responsibility to arrange payment with the billing authority for any additional rates costs which exceed the portion paid by ESFA. The onus is with the school to inform the billing authority of the buildings that are used for non-educational purposes.</p>

<p>*A property which is or may become liable to a rate, being a unit of such property, which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list (As defined in Section 115(1) of the General Rate Act 1967.)</p>

<h2>Handling of split sites</h2>

<p>Some billing authorities may have schools that operate over more than one site. In those instances, billing authorities can record the claims amount separately for these properties on the claims template.</p>

<h2>Recovery action</h2>

<p>To prevent recovery action, the ESFA in agreement with the billing authorities will make a lump sum payment for rates bills by 30 June in the financial year (or within 2 months of the date of claim), for all schools that that fall under their remit. The ESFA will also pay any adjustments to rates bills to billing authorities twice in the financial year; 31 October 2022 and the end of the financial year (31 March 2023). These payments will be issued as single lump sum payments.</p>

<p>This agreement falls within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1058/regulation/7/made" rel="external">following regulations regarding rates payments:</a></p>

<p>“a charging authority and a ratepayer may agree that the estimate of the amount payable should be paid in such a manner as is provided by the agreement, rather than in accordance with Schedule 1 [ of the Regulations]”, which requires payment by instalments.</p>

<h2>Adjustments</h2>

<p>Billing authorities can claim any adjustments to bill amounts through the ESFA. Billing authorities will upload revised bill data to the portal during the reconciliation window (1 July 2022 to 31 January 2023), with lump sum payments issued by the ESFA on 31 October 2022 and at the end of the financial year (31 March 2023).</p>

<p>The ESFA will cover the cost where historic adjustments result in increased bills, for adjustments which are raised after April and apply to bills claimed prior to April.  An example of this is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the rateable value of a school site has increased due to the construction of a new building in 2021, but this increase has not been reflected in any rates bills received before April 2022. In this instance, once the school informs their billing authority, they would receive an increased bill for 2022 to 2023, which would also reflect the backdated costs relating to 2021 to 2022 arising from the increase in their site’s rateable value. The billing authority would upload the new bill amount to the online billing portal, and ESFA would cover the full cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>For backdated adjustments which come to light after implementation of the new process and result in a decrease in rates bills, the responsibility to reclaim any overpayments rests with the liable party (that is, schools, or the local authority for community and voluntary controlled schools). For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if a school demolished a building which resulted in a decrease to their site’s rateable value but continued to pay the original bill amount, the school would be entitled to a refund. However, it remains the responsibility of the school to contact their billing authority to discharge the liability; the billing authority legally cannot get involved in an arrangement between the ratepayer and a third party (ESFA) to discharge the liability</li>
</ul>

<p>After the initial claim has been processed for the financial year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>where the rateable value decreases after the bill has been paid to the billing authority, the ESFA will calculate the date the change in the rateable value was applicable from. The overpayment by the ESFA will be deducted from the payment made to the billing authority for the following financial year</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where the rateable value increases after the bill has been paid to the billing authority, the ESFA will calculate the date the change in the rateable value was applicable from. The ESFA will pay the billing authority the additional revised amount on 31 October 2022 if the revised bill is submitted by 11 September or on 31 March 2023 if submitted after 11 September 2022 cut-off date</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any 2022 to 2023 adjustments submitted after the 31 January 2023 deadline will be paid in the following claim year. Adjustments for 2022 to 2023 will only be able to be submitted until 31 January 2024.</p>
  </li>

<h2>Discretionary/mandatory relief</h2>

<p>Where billing authorities already offer discretionary relief to schools in relation to their NNDR bills, or wish to do so in the future, this will continue under the new process.</p>

<p>The 80% mandatory rates relief applied to academies, voluntary aided schools and foundation schools will remain unchanged under the new process.</p>

<p>Billing authorities are reminded that any relief should continue to be applied to NNDR bills to display a net figure, ensuring that relief is deducted at source before bill amounts are uploaded so that payments are based on net liability.</p>

<h2>Penalty charges</h2>

<p>ESFA will cover any penalty charges on late claims that arise because of an ESFA error. We will communicate the details of this process in due course.</p>

<h2>Process for billing authorities not implementing the new payment process</h2>

<p>The NNDR payment process will remain as previous years for those billing authorities not implementing the new payment process in 2022 to 2023. Maintained schools and academies linked to these billing authorities will continue to pay NNDR bills directly to the billing authority.</p>

<h2>NNDR Funding (for education authorities)</h2>

<p>Local authority DSG allocations will include the 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR amount. Local authorities will include the 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR amount in schools budgets.</p>

<p>We will issue revised DSG allocations in March 2022 which will include NNDR. DSG payments will be made in April 2022 which will include NNDR funding.</p>

<p>NNDR adjustments due to revaluations for 2022 to 2023 will be submitted in the 2023 to 2024 APT. We will issue guidance on how this will be shown within the 2023 to 2024 NFF in due course.</p>

<p>Recoupment of academy NNDR funding will be based on the 2022 to 2023 NFF NNDR amount.</p>

<p>We will issue further guidance on how to record NNDR in the end of year accounts.</p>

<h2>Annex A NNDR implementation</h2>

<h4>1) What date is the process changing?</h4>

<p>1 April 2022</p>

<h4>2) Why is there an option to implement the changes this financial year?</h4>

<p>In March 2021 we consulted on proposals to centralise the payment of business rates for state-funded schools from 2022-23 with the ESFA paying NNDR bills directly to billing authorities on behalf of state-funded schools. The aim of the policy change was to improve the resource intensive process and simplify the complex circular flow of funding between the Agency, LAs and schools removing unnecessary burdens.</p>

<p>There has been no change to legislation (S233 of the Local Government Act 1972) so we recognise that we cannot impose this change. Billing authorities have fulfilled their legal duties by continuing to issue bills to maintained schools and academies. There is no requirement for billing authorities to provide the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) with this information, but we still wish to proceed with this change where billing authorities wish to participate.</p>

<p>Liability for NNDR remains with maintained schools and academies. This has not changed.</p>

<h4>3) Why do billing authorities have to opt in to the NNDR changes?</h4>

<p>We need to know which Billing Authorities are engaging in the new process to ensure we can provide clarity to schools and academies on what they need to do regarding payment of their NNDR bills.</p>

<h4>4) How do billing authorities confirm which payment process they are adopting?</h4>

<p>We are issuing a short form via email directly to billing authorities to confirm which payment process they are implementing in April 2022.</p>

<h4>5) What does this mean if a billing authority implements the new NNDR payment process?</h4>

<p>Billing authority – billing authorities will upload bill data to the ESFA online portal by 22 May 2022. Once validated they will receive a lump sum payment by 30 June 2022. They can also submit in year adjustments to claims between 1 July 2022 and 31 January 2023. These claims will be validated and paid at two points in the year: end of October and end of March 2023.</p>

<p>To Note: If a billing authority which is a district council (in other words, in a two-tier area) wants to implement the new payment process, all the billing authorities that are within that county must implement the changes too. If this cannot be agreed all the billing authorities within the county must continue with the current process.</p>

<p>Local authority – Dedicated schools grant (DSG) payments will not include NNDR funding. Local authorities will not include NNDR funding in schools budgets.</p>

<p>LA maintained schools – ESFA will confirm with the LA if their schools NNDR bills will be paid centrally.  Schools will receive a bill for information only.</p>

<p>Academies - ESFA will confirm with the academy that their NNDR bill will be paid centrally. Academies will receive a bill for information only.</p>

<h4>6) What does this mean if the billing authority doesn’t implement the new NNDR payment process?</h4>

<p>Billing authority – Continue with the existing arrangements. Billing authorities will issue bills to schools for payment as per the current process.</p>

<p>Local authority – Revised DSG allocations which will include NNDR will be issued in March 2023. DSG payments which will include NNDR funding based on the 2022-23 NFF NNDR will be made in April.  Local authorities will include NNDR funding in school budgets.</p>

<p>LA maintained schools – ESFA will confirm with the LA that schools are to continue with the existing arrangements and make NNDR payments to billing authorities as per the current process. Local authorities will continue to include NNDR funding based on the 2022-23 NFF NNDR amount in school budgets.</p>

<p>Academies – ESFA will confirm with the academies that they are to continue with the existing arrangements.</p>

<p>Academies will continue to pay NNDR bills directly to the billing authority and claim this money back from the ESFA using the existing NNDR portal.</p>

<h4>7) What guidance is available?</h4>

<p>We will publish the NNDR claims technical guidance at the end of February.</p>

<h4>8) Who do I contact if I have any concerns regarding the changes?</h4>

<p>Please use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">ESFA enquiry form</a> for any questions relating to the changes.</p>

<h4>9) What will happen next year, 2023 to 2024?</h4>
