<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This handbook sets out the principles that underpin our approach to monitoring schools with an overall effectiveness judgement of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>inadequate in their most recent graded inspection (also known as a section 5 inspection)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requires improvement in their two most recent graded inspections</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It also sets out how inspectors will monitor schools to identify whether the school is taking effective action to improve.</p>

<p>2.	We have published information about other inspections that we carry out (graded, reduced and urgent inspections) in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif">school inspection handbook</a>. We recommend that schools familiarise themselves with the wider inspection policy in that handbook, including our grade descriptors for graded inspections, alongside this one.</p>

<p>3.	We carry out all inspections that form part of our monitoring programmes under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/8" rel="external">section 8(2) of the Education Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>4.	A school categorised as having ‘serious weaknesses’ is a school that meets the definition of ‘requiring significant improvement’, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/44" rel="external">section 44 of the Education Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>5.	A school which requires special measures is a school that meets the definition of ‘requiring significant improvement’, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/44" rel="external">section 44 of the Education Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>6.	This handbook has 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1. Ofsted’s monitoring policy: this sets out the principles that apply to monitoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2. Monitoring programmes: this sets out the monitoring programmes for different types of school and contexts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 3. Monitoring inspections: this describes the policy and process for monitoring inspections for schools with each of the following overall effectiveness judgements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>schools judged as requires improvement</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>schools judged as inadequate, including: schools with serious weaknesses and schools that are judged require special measures</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>7.	Our monitoring process provides support and challenge to school leaders and those responsible for the governance of the school as they go through a period of improvement and change. Monitoring reports also provide assurance to parents about the improvement journey that a school is on, so that they are informed about the quality of education that their child is currently receiving.</p>

<p>8.	The monitoring inspection process allows schools to receive a graded inspection as soon as possible when there is a realistic prospect of an improved overall effectiveness judgement being made. Routine monitoring inspection minimises the time a school waits to receive a graded inspection when it has improved.</p>

<h3>Gathering personal information on inspection</h3>

<p>9.	Inspectors will gather any personal information necessary to assist them in inspecting a school. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/schools-ofsted-privacy-notice">Our privacy policy</a> sets out what personal information we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it and individuals’ rights under data protection legislation.</p>

<p>10.	Individuals and organisations are legally required to provide inspectors with access to information. Section 10 of The Education Act 2005 gives inspectors powers of entry to any premises on which a school provides education to pupils. It also gives them a right to inspect, and take copies of, any records kept by the school, and any other documents containing information relating to the school, which the Chief Inspector considers relevant to the discharge of her functions. These powers enable inspectors to look at computers and other devices that may hold relevant information. Regulations enable the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) to provide Ofsted with information on individual pupils where it relates to school inspections.</p>

<p>11.	Inspectors gather evidence at inspection and record this on Ofsted’s systems. They may also see evidence on site that contains personal information about staff and young people, such as registers and lesson plans. Inspectors may take notes from, or copies of, this type of evidence before handing it back to an appropriate staff member at the end of the inspection. Inspectors will store securely any notes or copies as evidence and will not retain these personally. Inspectors may take photographs of pupils’ work. They will store securely any photographs as evidence and will not retain these personally.</p>

<p>12.	In most schools, inspectors will gather evidence electronically using a range of devices, including laptops, mobile phones and tablets. Inspectors should transfer evidence securely in line with our security policies.</p>

<h3>Research on inspection</h3>

<p>13.	We may carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/research">research</a> during our inspections. Where this happens, the research activity will have no impact on inspection judgements. As our research work is based on our national priorities, we may invite providers to participate in research visits at other times.</p>

<h2>Part 1. Ofsted’s monitoring policy</h2>

<p>14.	Through our monitoring programmes, inspectors will evaluate how school leaders and those responsible for governance roles are improving the school. Inspectors will identify the factors that are leading to sustainable improvement and any barriers that may prevent improvement from happening as quickly as it should.</p>

<p>15.	All schools that received an overall effectiveness judgement of inadequate in their most recent graded inspection, or of requires improvement in their two most recent graded inspections, will receive routine monitoring until they secure an improved grade.</p>

<p>16.	Monitoring is a flexible process. The focus and improvement steps for each school will depend on its context. This means that the exact content of a monitoring programme that a school receives will depend on how quickly the school makes sustainable improvements (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#part-2">part 2 of this handbook</a>).</p>

<p>17.	Monitoring is forward-looking. It does not just focus on what issues caused the school to be judged less than good, as this can encourage ‘quick fixes’ that focus on the symptoms, rather than the causes, of weaknesses. Inspectors will instead focus on the school’s progress towards either becoming a good school, as defined by the education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>), or coming out of a category of concern (serious weaknesses or special measures). They will also look at how the school is addressing weaknesses identified in previous inspections. Monitoring inspections evaluate whether leaders’ actions are effective (that leaders are taking the right actions in the right order at the right time), while bearing in mind the end goal of improving the school.</p>

<p>18.	The aims of this process are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>establish and maintain a constructive relationship between school leaders and inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>support the school by highlighting specific areas of the school’s performance that need to improve</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify quickly whether a school is improving or not</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure that, when schools improve, they receive a graded inspection at the earliest opportunity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>19.	During the monitoring process, inspectors will look for evidence of how well leaders have understood what the school needs to do to become a good school and how well it is improving.</p>

<p>20.	Monitoring inspections will normally be carried out by Her Majesty’s Inspectors.</p>

<h3>What we know about schools that improve</h3>

<p>21.	Our research (particularly <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fight-or-flight-how-stuck-schools-are-overcoming-isolation">‘Fight or flight? How “stuck” schools are overcoming isolation’</a> and experience from inspection have led us to identify a number of core factors in school improvement.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for schools that were judged to be inadequate at their last graded inspection</h3>

<p>22.	Schools whose overall effectiveness is judged to be inadequate following a graded inspection will be deemed to be in a formal category of concern.</p>

<p>23.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, but neither quality of education nor personal development is ‘inadequate’, inspectors will conclude that the school is giving an acceptable standard of education and will judge the school to have serious weaknesses.</p>

<p>24.	If the school’s grade either for quality of education or for personal development is ‘inadequate’, inspectors will conclude that the school is failing to give an acceptable standard of education. Inspectors must then consider whether leaders, managers and governors are demonstrating the capacity to improve the school.</p>

<p>25.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, and is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education but leaders, managers and governors are demonstrating the capacity to improve, they will judge the school to have serious weaknesses.</p>

<p>26.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, and is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and leaders, managers and governors are not demonstrating the capacity to improve the school, then the school will be judged to require special measures.</p>

<p>27.	There are a number of specific matters that we consider when monitoring inadequate schools, as set out below.</p>

<h4>Academy orders and the monitoring process</h4>

<p>28.	Maintained schools and pupil referral units (<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>) that are judged to be causing concern will be subject to a directive academy order. The Secretary of State has a duty to make an academy order for all maintained schools judged to have serious weaknesses (and so ‘requiring significant improvement’) under the Education Act 2005 and those that are judged to require special measures. This includes maintained special schools, but excludes maintained nursery schools and non-maintained special schools.</p>

<p>29.	For academies that are causing concern, the Secretary of State has a power to terminate the funding agreement, and the academy may become part of a trust or be rebrokered to another trust.</p>

<p>30.	Maintained schools or <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> that have been issued with an academy order and academies that are being rebrokered to new sponsors following termination of their funding agreements will not normally receive monitoring inspections.</p>

<p>31.	If there is a delay in any school judged inadequate becoming a sponsored academy or being rebrokered to be sponsored by a new trust, we may initiate monitoring of the school. This is to check on what progress has been made in tackling the areas where inspection has identified that improvement is needed. Monitoring activity will usually start if there has been a delay to the brokering or rebrokering process of at least 9 months.</p>

<p>32.	In the case of schools where serious safeguarding concerns have been identified, it is essential that early action is taken to ensure that pupils are safe. We may, in some cases, carry out a monitoring inspection within 3 to 6 months after the publication of the graded inspection report to ensure that schools take action on safeguarding. These inspections will not include checks on the extent to which the school and the relevant authority are supporting the transition to sponsored academy status.</p>

<p>33.	Where a school receives a new <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> (e.g. once an inadequate maintained school or <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> has become a sponsored academy, or an inadequate academy has been moved to a new sponsor with a new funding agreement) we will inspect it as a new school, with its first inspection being a graded inspection. This will usually take place during the third year of operation (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms). However, in exceptional circumstances, schools that become new academies may receive a reduced inspection before their next graded inspection.</p>

<p>34.	Academies judged to be inadequate that are not brokered or rebrokered, will be subject to monitoring. Academies judged to be inadequate that are rebrokered, but do not receive a new <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>, will not normally be monitored, but will not be treated as a new school for the purposes of reinspection.</p>

<p>35.	We will determine the timing of the next graded inspection by the academy’s rate of improvement. However, it will normally take place within 30 months of the publication of the graded inspection report. For the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms.</p>

<p>36.	Maintained nursery schools and non-maintained special schools judged inadequate are not subject to academy orders and will be monitored as set out in this section of the handbook.</p>

<h4>Other legal requirements for inadequate schools</h4>

<p>37.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/15" rel="external">Section 15 of the Education Act 2005</a> requires local authorities or trusts (as appropriate) that are responsible for an inadequate school to prepare, and send to Ofsted and the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>, a statement of action. This should set out the action that they propose to take, the period within which they propose to take it and the arrangements they propose to make for engaging with parents. The statement will form part of the evidence base that inspectors will consider when monitoring, alongside any improvement plan prepared by the school.</p>

<p>38.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1115/regulation/6/made" rel="external">The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012</a> state that early career teachers (<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>) (not including trainee teachers on employment-based training programmes) may not be appointed to maintained schools or <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> judged to require special measures, unless we have given permission in writing. Schools judged to require special measures must apply to us in writing if they wish to appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, stating the reasons for the request. We may strongly recommend in any report that an academy should not appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>; however, this is only advisory.</p>

<h2>Part 2. Monitoring programmes</h2>

<p>39.	Subject to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#academy-orders">‘academy orders and the monitoring process’</a> section above, all schools that are graded inadequate will receive a monitoring programme with at least one monitoring inspection, as will schools that receive a second consecutive judgement of requires improvement.</p>

<p>40.	The structure of monitoring programmes will reflect the fact that some schools are further along the improvement journey than others.</p>

<p>41.	Inspectors recognise that leading an organisation through a period of change is demanding for school leaders and presents a different challenge to maintaining standards in a good or an outstanding school. For this reason, inspectors will want to understand how all those responsible for the improvement of the school, not just school leaders, are contributing to the process. Inspectors will want to understand the role that governors and trustees, multi-academy trust (<abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>) leaders and local authority staff play in securing improvement and will look closely at the support, challenge and capacity provided to the school leadership.</p>

<p>42.	Each monitoring inspection will focus on how the school is progressing towards becoming good and may explore the key areas laid out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#improve">part 1</a>. Inspectors will seek to understand the extent to which school leaders have identified the weak areas of the school and whether they are taking the necessary steps to improve.</p>

<h3>Monitoring programmes for schools that require improvement</h3>

<p>43.	Schools judged as requires improvement will not normally receive monitoring if any of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school had a judgement of outstanding, good or inadequate before its most recent graded inspection, or this was the school’s first graded inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s most recent ‘leadership and management’ judgement is good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher has changed since the last graded inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>44.	When we monitor schools with a judgement of requires improvement, monitoring programmes will usually consist of a single monitoring inspection that takes place within 12 months of the graded inspection that judged the school to require improvement.</p>

<p>45.	These schools will usually receive a graded inspection within 30 months after the publication of the graded report (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms). The timing of the reinspection will be at the discretion of Ofsted’s relevant regional director.</p>

<p>46.	If, following a monitoring inspection, the lead inspector considers that a school is ready for reinspection because it has made sufficient progress, they may recommend that the next graded inspection is brought forward.</p>

<p>47.	If the lead inspector feels that the school would benefit from further time to improve to a judgement of good, they may recommend that the school is reinspected later in the 30-month inspection window.</p>

<h3>Monitoring programmes for inadequate schools</h3>

<p>48.	Inspectors will usually carry out a monitoring inspection within 3 to 9 months of the publication of the graded inspection report. However, this may be supplemented by additional inspections.</p>

<p>49.	A school may receive up to 5 monitoring inspections over the 30 months following the publication of the graded inspection report that graded it inadequate. The expectation is that the school will improve and come out of a category of concern within 18 to 24 months.</p>

<p>50.	At the end of a monitoring inspection, inspectors will consider whether the school has made sufficient progress and no longer requires a category of concern. Where this is the case, the monitoring inspection will be deemed to be a graded inspection. All the judgements required by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-inspection-handbook">school inspection handbook</a> will be made and a full inspection report produced.</p>

<p>51.	If, after a programme of monitoring inspections lasting up to 30 months, the school has not been removed from a category of concern (that is, it has not been graded as ‘requires improvement’ or higher), it will receive a graded inspection.</p>

<p>52.	Maintained schools or <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> that have been issued with an academy order and academies that are being rebrokered to new sponsors following termination of their funding agreements will not normally receive monitoring inspections. If there is a delay in any school judged inadequate becoming a sponsored academy or being rebrokered to be sponsored by a new trust, we may initiate monitoring of the school. This will check what progress has been made in tackling the matters where the most recent graded inspection identified that improvement was needed. Monitoring activity will usually start if there has been a delay to the brokering or rebrokering process of at least 9 months.</p>

<h2>Part 3. Monitoring inspections</h2>

<p>53.	Monitoring inspections are selective and focused on where the school needs to improve in order to come out of its category of concern or become good. In deciding the focus, inspectors will consider the findings from the most recent graded inspection.</p>

<p>54.	It is important that the school’s leaders demonstrate that they are having a significant impact on all of the areas of weakness and are capable of securing further improvement. Inspectors should consider the extent to which the school’s leaders demonstrate capacity to improve the school in a sustainable way.</p>

<p>55.	There should be clear evidence that leaders and managers are having an impact on improving the quality of education and securing meaningful progress on improvement within the curriculum, particularly in schools where attainment is low.</p>

<p>56.	Inspectors must consider the impact of the external support provided to the school and, as appropriate, any support and challenge provided by external partners on school improvement. If a school is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> and is receiving support from within the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, inspectors will be clear that this is internal, not external, support.</p>

<h3>Before the monitoring inspection</h3>

<h4>Inspector’s preparation for monitoring inspections</h4>

<p>57.	We do not require schools to prepare an action plan, but we will expect schools to review their existing plans to address matters where the most recent graded inspection identified that improvement was needed.</p>

<p>58.	The lead inspector will prepare for the monitoring inspection by reviewing the inspection history and other relevant information to build a picture of what has been happening to the school over time. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>previous Ofsted inspection reports (including local authority <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> and inspecting local area children’s services (<abbr title="inspections of local authority children's services">ILACS</abbr>) reports, where relevant)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any performance information published since the last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from Ofsted Parent View</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a summary of any self-evaluation, improvement plan or action plan or equivalent that the school has completed, as appropriate; this should include any specific information about curriculum and governance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information about the curriculum on the school’s website, plus any additional information on the school’s website that the lead inspector deems relevant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any complaints made about the school to Ofsted since the last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information on Ofsted’s provider information portal, including any warning notices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for inadequate schools, the local authority or <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> statement of action for the school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>59.	During the monitoring inspection, the lead inspector will seek to identify the barriers that are preventing the school from improving. The lead inspector will decide where to focus inspection activities to gather evidence about how quickly and effectively leaders, managers and those responsible for governance are tackling the areas where the most recent graded inspection identified a need for the school to improve.</p>

<p>60.	Evidence will also be gathered to assess and report on progress made over time since the school was first judged to require improvement or be inadequate. The inspection will report on any barriers that are preventing the school from improving quickly and sustainably.</p>

<h4>Notification</h4>

<p>61.	The lead inspector will usually telephone the school up to 2 school days before the start of the on-site monitoring inspection. If the headteacher is unavailable, the lead inspector should ask to speak to the next most senior member of staff and explain the arrangements for the monitoring inspection.</p>

<p>62.	In academies that are part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the lead inspector should also arrange to speak to the chief executive officer (CEO) or their delegate (or equivalent) during the inspection where these roles are part of the structure.</p>

<p>63.	The lead inspector should seek to ensure that the headteacher will be present on the day of the inspection. Once the inspection has been confirmed, the lead inspector will inform the inspection support team at Ofsted, who will send formal notification to the school by email.</p>

<p>64.	During the initial telephone call with the school, the lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>confirm the date of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>explain the purpose of the monitoring inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that the school will inform the governing body and the local authority/proprietor/trust (as relevant) and that the lead inspector will wish to speak to them during the inspection to discuss how aspects of the quality of education are improving</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss which leaders and staff will need to be involved in the inspection, the practical arrangements for inspection and the inspection activities needed, which may include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>meeting staff</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>reviewing documentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>talking to pupils</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>reviewing pupils’ work</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>lesson visits</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide the opportunity to discuss any specific issues that the lead inspector should be made aware of before arriving to start the monitoring inspection the next day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask the school to upload any action or improvement plan and/or self-evaluation they have completed to the portal</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>65.	While the lead inspector will consider the progress made in implementing the school’s action plan and the impact of leaders’, managers’ and governors’ actions, lead inspectors are not visiting simply to evaluate action plans, but to challenge and support the school.</p>

<h4>Requests for inspections to be deferred or cancelled</h4>

<p>66.	A school may request a deferral of its inspection to the inspection support administrator, or to the lead inspector, on the day it is notified of the inspection. We will not normally consider deferrals if we receive them after 4.30pm on the day the school is notified. The inspection support administrator or lead inspector must immediately contact the regional duty desk. We will decide whether this should be granted in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deferring-ofsted-inspections">our deferral policy</a>.</p>

<p>67.	Normally, if the school is providing education to pupils, the inspection will go ahead. In exceptional circumstances, however, an inspection might be cancelled or deferred after the school has been notified, following a request made by the school. We will aim to let the school know whether a request is granted on the same day it is made, but in some cases (particularly when the request for deferral comes later), this may happen by 8am the next morning.</p>

<p>68.	If a school is within 6 months of confirmed closure, and this is evidenced in a funding agreement, for example, but the school does not request a cancellation when the inspector makes contact, the inspection support administrator will call the regional duty desk to highlight this and get advice about whether the inspection should still be carried out. We will make decisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>The monitoring inspection visit</h3>

<p>69.	All monitoring inspections focus on the extent to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders have high expectations of all pupils in the school, and the extent to which these are embodied in leaders’ and staff’s day-to-day interactions with pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders focus their attention on the education provided by the school. There are many demands on leaders, but a greater focus on this area is associated with better outcomes for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>continuing professional development for teachers and staff is aligned with the curriculum, and the extent to which this develops teachers’ content knowledge over time, so that they are able to deliver better teaching for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders create coherence and consistency across the school so that pupils benefit from effective teaching and consistent expectations, wherever they are in the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders seek to engage parents and their community thoughtfully and positively in a way that supports pupils’ education, and whether they are thoughtful in drawing boundaries and resisting inappropriate attempts to influence what is taught and the day-to-day life of the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders take into account the workload and well-being of their staff, while also developing and strengthening the quality of the workforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders’ and managers’ high ambitions are for all pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. This includes ensuring that practices such as ‘off-rolling’ do not take place and that the way the school uses the pupil premium is founded on good evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders and those responsible for governance all understand their respective roles and perform these in a way that enhances the effectiveness of the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where applicable, the school no longer requires a category of concern, and so should receive a graded inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Activities carried out by inspectors</h4>

<p>70.	During the monitoring inspection, the lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meet the headteacher and other senior leaders (including, where appropriate, the CEO of the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> or their delegate (or equivalent)) to establish a purposeful and productive working relationship and focus on discussing the actions taken so far to tackle issues from the graded inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hold meetings with representatives of the local authority/proprietor/trust, the chair, and members of the governing board, or, where appropriate, the chair of the board of trustees, to establish what action is being taken</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gather any other evidence needed. This may include discussions with staff and pupils, observing learning and pupils’ behaviour, and talking to pupils about their work and their progress</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider views expressed on Ofsted Parent View. Where possible, inspectors will talk to parents about their views about the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss with the headteacher the next steps that leaders need to take to improve the school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>71.	The exact structure of the monitoring inspection and the activities that the inspector carries out will reflect where the school is on its improvement journey and the areas that are most pertinent to sustained improvement.</p>

<h4>Inspectors will not look at internal progress or attainment data</h4>

<p>72.	Inspectors will not look at non-statutory internal progress and attainment data on inspections of schools. Teachers have told us that they believe this will help us play our part in reducing unnecessary workload.</p>

<p>73.	That does not mean that schools cannot use data if they consider it appropriate. Inspectors will, however, focus more on the curriculum and less on schools’ generation, analysis and interpretation of data. Inspectors will be interested in the conclusions drawn and actions taken from any internal assessment information, but they will not examine or verify that information first hand. Inspectors will use published national performance data as a starting point on inspection, where it is available.</p>

<h4>Workload</h4>

<p>74.	Inspectors will consider the extent to which leaders engage with staff and are aware and take account of the main pressures on them, engaging with them realistically and constructively. They will consider the extent to which staff are supported by the school leadership and those in governance roles to implement the improvements that are required. Inspectors will also consider whether changes are made in a way that avoids creating unmanageable workload.</p>

<h4>Gaming and off-rolling</h4>

<p>75.	When carrying out monitoring inspections, inspectors will be particularly alert to any evidence that suggests that the school may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gaming – entering pupils for courses or qualifications that are not in their educational best interest in order to achieve apparently better performance for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>off-rolling – removing a pupil or pupils from the school without a formal permanent exclusion when the removal is primarily in the interests of the school rather than in the best interests of the pupil; further explanation of off-rolling is in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-inspection-handbook">school inspection handbook</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Seeking the views of parents and staff</h4>

<p>76.	The lead inspector will review evidence from Ofsted Parent View during the inspection to take any relevant information from responses into account. The lead inspector may also decide to open the free-text facility for the inspection, although this will normally only be where a school is judged to require special measures.</p>

<p>77.	The views of staff may also be gathered through an online questionnaire, although this will normally only be where a school is judged to require special measures.</p>

<p>78.	The inspection support administrator will send a link to the school when surveys are open, along with the formal notification of inspection. We will ask the school to encourage staff and/or parents (as appropriate) to complete the online questionnaire.</p>

<h4>Safeguarding</h4>

<p>79.	Although inspectors will always satisfy themselves that there are no significant safeguarding concerns, they will only report specifically on the effectiveness of safeguarding where the previous graded or monitoring inspection found safeguarding to be ineffective.</p>

<p>80.	If this is the case, inspectors should evaluate whether safeguarding is now effective, using the guidance in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education: statutory guidance for schools and colleges’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">‘Working together to safeguard children’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-environments-where-children-can-flourish">‘Positive environments where children can flourish’</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>81.	This should include whether there have been any further safeguarding incidents since the previous inspection of the school. Inspectors must record the school’s response as part of the evidence gathered.</p>

<p>82.	If safeguarding as previously judged to be ineffective, but is now judged to be effective, the report will include a judgement that: ‘safeguarding is effective’.</p>

<p>83.	If safeguarding is not effective or if pupils are considered to be at risk, the lead inspector will deem the inspection to be a graded inspection (unless the school is already inadequate).</p>

<p>84.	In the event of concerns or queries about safeguarding, inspectors should contact their regional duty desk.</p>

<p>85.	In the event of a current or ongoing incident coming to light during the inspection, inspectors should refer to ‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’, which contains guidance on what to include in the inspection report.</p>

<p>86.	Regardless of whether safeguarding has been identified as a specific area that must improve, inspectors will always be interested in how the school keeps pupils safe. In addition to making general observations about safeguarding, inspectors will always:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check the school’s single central record, focusing on staff that have joined since the last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review the school’s safeguarding training schedule or record, focusing on new staff that have joined since the last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review Ofsted Parent View responses for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask a selection of pupils, in an age-appropriate way, if they know how to raise safeguarding concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask a selection of staff, including non-teaching staff and new staff, if they know how to raise safeguarding concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>87.	On a very small number of occasions, inspectors may come across evidence of child abuse, or allegations of child abuse that are currently being investigated, within a school. Inspectors should consult all relevant guidance referred to above and seek advice where appropriate. Inspectors must not attempt to investigate any incident of child abuse but will ensure that concerns about a child’s safety are referred, as appropriate, to the relevant local authority’s children’s services department. The referral will normally be made by the safeguarding lead for the school.</p>

<h4>Evaluating support provided to inadequate schools that are judged to require special measures</h4>

<p>88.	During the first monitoring inspection of an inadequate school that is judged to require special measures, inspectors will meet with the headteacher, the CEO or their delegate (or equivalent in a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>), the chair of the governing body or board of trustees and as many governors or trustees as possible. Inspectors will look for evidence of how well relevant leaders and those responsible for governance are implementing the school’s plans for improvement.</p>

<p>89.	On subsequent inspections, inspectors will also report on the impact of the trust’s or local authority’s support for the school, along with any other external support and challenge on school improvement.</p>

<p>90.	If a school is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> and is receiving support from within the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, inspectors will be clear that this is internal, not external, support.</p>

<h3>Monitoring inspection judgements</h3>

<p>91.	This section sets out the judgements that inspectors will make at the end of a monitoring inspection. There are different judgements for schools that require improvement and schools that are judged to be inadequate with serious weaknesses or inadequate and judged to require special measures.</p>

<p>92.	Monitoring inspections will focus on the actions taken by the school’s leaders and those responsible for governance to tackle the areas that led to the school being judged to require improvement or to be inadequate at its graded inspection. Monitoring inspections must also focus on the progress that the school has made since the graded judgement was issued towards becoming a good school and/or coming out of a category of concern.</p>

<h4>Schools that require improvement</h4>

<p>93.	At the end of the monitoring inspection, the lead inspector will make a single overarching judgement, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">[The school] continues to require improvement. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the school to become good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">[The school] continues to require improvement. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Inadequate schools with serious weaknesses</h4>

<p>94.	The monitoring inspection report must include an assessment of the effectiveness of the action taken by the school towards removal of the serious weaknesses designation. An overarching judgement will also be made, stating whether:</p>

<p>[The school] remains inadequate and has serious weaknesses. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>[The school] remains inadequate and has serious weaknesses. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</p>

<p>95.	Whichever judgement is reached, if inspectors decide not to deem it a graded inspection (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#graded">paragraph 119</a>), the school will remain in a category of concern, and its overall effectiveness grade will remain inadequate. Inspectors will explain this to the school.</p>

<p>96.	The crucial factor in reaching a judgement is the anticipated timescale for the removal of the serious weaknesses designation given the current rate of improvement. A school in which leaders and managers are taking effective action is one that will be on course to have the serious weaknesses designation removed within 30 months after the publication of the previous graded inspection report. A school that is not taking effective action will be likely to continue to have serious weaknesses, or may be judged to require special measures, when the graded inspection takes place.</p>

<p>97.	Inspectors will base this judgement on the school’s progress towards coming out of its category of concern. Although generally this will be informed by the matters where the most recent graded inspection identified that improvement was needed, other factors that arise during the monitoring period must not be ignored. Inspectors should make the key judgement about the school’s overall progress towards the removal of the serious weaknesses designation by considering the evidence that they have gathered and by using their professional judgement.</p>

<p>98.	If a monitoring inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection, or a separate graded inspection takes place at a later date, the grades for all key judgements and for overall effectiveness will be updated. If the lead inspector on this inspection judges that the school no longer has serious weaknesses, the oral feedback and written report must include the formal statement that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In accordance with section 13(5) of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is of the opinion that the school no longer requires significant improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>99.	This judgement is not subject to moderation. However, as with all inspections, it should remain confidential until we send the final report to the school.</p>

<p>100.	When the serious weaknesses designation is removed, the lead inspector must, on the final day of the inspection, notify Ofsted’s relevant regional duty desk.</p>

<h4>Inadequate schools that are subject to special measures</h4>

<p>101.	During the monitoring inspections, inspectors are required to evaluate the school’s progress towards the removal of special measures. Inspectors will make an overarching judgement on whether:</p>

<p>[The school] remains inadequate and requires special measures. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>[The school] remains inadequate and requires special measures. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</p>

<p>102.	Whichever judgement is reached, if inspectors decide not to deem it a graded inspection (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#report-introduction">paragraph 124</a>), the school will remain in a category of concern, and its overall effectiveness grade will remain inadequate. Inspectors will explain this to the school.</p>

<p>103.	Inspectors will base the judgement on the school’s progress towards coming out of its category of concern. Although generally this will be informed by matters where the most recent graded inspection identified that improvement was needed, other factors that arise during the monitoring period must not be ignored. The crucial factor is the anticipated timescale for the school to be judged to no longer require special measures, given the current rate of improvement. A school that is taking effective action will be on course to no longer require special measures within 18 to 24 months of the monitoring period after publication of the inspection report that judged the school to require special measures. A school that is not taking effective action will be likely to continue to require special measures when the next graded inspection takes place.</p>

<p>104.	If a monitoring inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection, or a separate graded inspection takes place at a later date, the grades for all key judgements and for overall effectiveness will be updated. If the lead inspector on this inspection judges that special measures are no longer required, the oral feedback and written report should include the formal statement that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In accordance with section 13(4) of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is of the opinion that the school no longer requires special measures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>105.	This judgement is not subject to moderation. However, as with all inspections, it should remain confidential until we send the final report to the school.</p>

<p>106.	When it is judged that special measures are no longer required, inspectors must write a full graded report. They must also, on the final day of the inspection, notify Ofsted’s relevant regional duty desk.</p>

<h3>Feedback at the end of the monitoring inspection</h3>

<p>107.	The school will receive verbal feedback at the end of each monitoring inspection on the school’s improvement plan. Feedback at the end of each monitoring inspection must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>report the range of evidence gathered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>comment on the impact of any support for school improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cover any specific issues identified by the lead inspector in the pre-inspection preparation and during the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make clear that the text of the report may differ from the verbal feedback, but that the judgements will not change unless quality assurance deems that appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>108.	The lead inspector will chair the final feedback meeting, and they will agree with the headteacher, who should attend. Normally, the final feedback meeting will be attended by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher or principal and other senior leaders, as agreed by the lead inspector and headteacher</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for maintained schools, the chair of the school’s governing body and as many governors as possible; the clerk to governors (or equivalent), or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for academies, including academies that are part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the chair of the board of trustees, and as many governors or trustees as possible; the clerk to governors or the board (or equivalent) or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in an academy that is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the CEO or their delegate (or equivalent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a representative from the local authority (for maintained schools) or the academy sponsor</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>109.	During the final feedback meeting of a monitoring inspection, the lead inspector will ensure that the headteacher, those responsible for governance and all attendees are clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>about the judgements made</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the main findings of the inspection and the main points provided orally in the feedback, subject to any change, will be reflected in the text of the report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about areas where improvement is needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the judgements are provisional and so may be subject to change as a result of quality assurance procedures or moderation and must, therefore, be treated as restricted and confidential to the relevant staff (as determined by the school). They may be shared with all those responsible for the governance of the school, irrespective of whether they attended the meeting, so long as they are clearly marked as provisional and subject to quality assurance. Information about the inspection outcomes should be shared more widely only when the school receives a copy of the final inspection report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the procedure for making a complaint about the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>110.	If there are serious concerns about the lack of urgency in tackling weakness at the school, the lead inspector will expect to speak to the governing board or board of trustees, or as many governors or trustees as possible, and will share the concerns with the school and make specific recommendations for more urgent action or intervention. If needed, they will arrange to do this after the inspection. The lead inspector should also invite the CEO or their delegate (or equivalent of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>) to the final feedback meeting. These meetings may include a virtual option using video or telephone calls if necessary.</p>

<p>111.	If a monitoring inspection identifies serious concerns about aspects of the school’s performance that were not identified in the previous graded inspection or in any earlier monitoring visits, the inspector should report these and they may lead to the next graded inspection being brought forward.</p>

<h4>Final feedback meeting for inadequate schools with serious weaknesses</h4>

<p>112.	In addition to the points covered above, the inspector will include the judgement made about the effectiveness of actions towards the removal of serious weaknesses, describing the progress made against the matters where the most recent graded inspection identified that improvement was needed.</p>

<h4>Final feedback meeting for inadequate schools that require special measures</h4>

<p>113.	In addition to the points covered above, the inspection team must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>judge the progress that the school is making towards no longer requiring special measures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>decide whether the school should be permitted to appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> or, in the case of academies, make appropriate recommendations regarding these appointments</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>114.	Whatever the outcome, inspectors must clearly explain the reasons for the decision to remove or not to remove the special measures judgement.</p>

<p>115.	The judgement that special measures are no longer required may involve reference to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the best interests of the pupils; this is paramount</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence from previous monitoring inspections</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s ability to demonstrate that it meets the needs of all pupils and has the capacity for sustained improvement. This determines the timing of removal of the special measures judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which capacity for sustained improvement has been demonstrated by leaders and managers at all levels, rather than through an over-reliance on external support or on 1 or 2 individuals in the school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Monitoring inspections that are deemed to be graded inspections</h3>

<p>116.	This section outlines the circumstances in which a monitoring inspection may be deemed to be a graded inspection. The full graded inspection schedule is set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif">school inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<p>117.	If a monitoring inspection has been deemed to be a graded inspection and the judgement is that the school has serious weaknesses or requires special measures, the Secretary of State must be informed.</p>

<h4>Deeming of monitoring inspections of schools that require improvement</h4>

<p>118.	Where the lead inspector has significant concerns about a school, they may deem the monitoring inspection to be a graded inspection.</p>

<p>119.	In exceptional circumstances, where the concerns are such that the school requires an immediate graded inspection, the monitoring inspection may be deemed to be a graded inspection, usually within 48 hours. Where the lead inspector finds that the school’s performance would be very likely to be judged good if a graded inspection were held, they may also choose to deem that monitoring inspection a graded inspection. Where this is the case, inspectors will inform the school straight away and the graded inspection will usually take place within 4 weeks. Inspectors will make all the judgements required by the evaluation schedule and will produce a graded inspection report. Where necessary, more inspectors may be deployed to complete the inspection.</p>

<h4>Deeming of monitoring inspections of schools that are inadequate with serious weaknesses</h4>

<p>120.	Where inspectors are satisfied that the school is taking effective action and making enough progress for the likely removal of the serious weaknesses designation, they will take the decision to deem the monitoring inspection to be a graded inspection. This may result in the school being judged as no longer having serious weaknesses. Where a monitoring inspection identifies significant concerns about aspects of the school’s performance that were not identified in the previous graded inspection or any earlier monitoring inspections, inspectors must consider these and they will affect the judgement about the progress made by the school.</p>

<p>121.	When the serious weaknesses designation is removed, whether through a monitoring inspection deemed to be a graded inspection or when the next graded inspection takes place, the lead inspector must, on the final day of the inspection, notify Ofsted’s relevant regional duty desk.</p>

<p>122.	The school details page of the report must include the statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This inspection was carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. The inspection was deemed to be a graded inspection under the same Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>123.	Where the graded inspection team has reached the judgement that the school no longer has serious weaknesses, the oral feedback and written report must include the formal statement that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In accordance with section 13(5) of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is of the opinion that the school no longer requires significant improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>124.	The introduction to the report should explain why the school was inspected. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When xx school was inspected in xx 20xx, it was judged to have serious weaknesses. Subsequently, the school was inspected on xxx occasions. At the last monitoring inspection, leaders were judged to have made progress to improve the school, but more work was necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When xx school was inspected in xx 20xx, it was judged to have serious weaknesses. Subsequently, the school was inspected on xxx occasions. At the last monitoring inspection, leaders were judged to have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Deeming of monitoring inspections of schools that are inadequate and require special measures</h4>

<p>125.	When it is judged that the school no longer requires special measures, the monitoring inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection. A full inspection report must be written and published in accordance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif">school inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<p>126.	The school details page of the report must include the statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">This inspection was carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005. The inspection was deemed to be a section 5 inspection under the same Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>127.	The introduction to the report should explain why the school was inspected. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When xx school was inspected in xx 20xx, it was judged to require special measures. Subsequently, the school was inspected on xxx occasions. At the last monitoring inspection, leaders were judged to have made progress to improve the school, but more work was necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">When xx school was inspected in xx 20xx, it was judged to require special measures. Subsequently, the school was inspected on xxx occasions. At the last monitoring inspection, leaders were judged to have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>128.	A report that removes the special measures judgement should include the following statement in accordance with the graded report template guidance:</p>

<p>In accordance with section 13(4) of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is of the opinion that the school no longer requires special measures.</p>

<h3>After the monitoring inspection visit</h3>

<h4>The monitoring inspection report letters</h4>

<p>129.	The school will receive a short monitoring report, which we will publish on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a>.</p>

<p>130.	All monitoring inspection reports will set out an evaluation of whether school leaders and those responsible for governance have made progress to ensure that pupils receive a good quality of education, and particularly whether they are building or adopting an effective curriculum.</p>

<p>131.	In addition, the report will include the following information, depending on the school’s existing overall effectiveness judgement from its most recent graded inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>for all inadequate schools, the quality of the school’s improvement plans and, where applicable, the impact of any support provided to the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for schools that require special measures, a judgement about whether the school may employ <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> or a recommendation on this for academies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Arrangements for publishing the report</h4>

<p>132.	The lead inspector is responsible for writing the inspection report and submitting the evidence to Ofsted shortly after the inspection ends. The text of the report should explain the judgements and reflect the evidence. The findings in the report should be consistent with the feedback given to the school at the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>133.	Inspection reports will be quality assured before we send a draft to the school. In most circumstances, the school will receive the draft report within 18 working days after the end of the inspection. The draft report is restricted and confidential to the relevant personnel (as determined by the school), including those responsible for governance, and should not be shared more widely or published. We may also send the draft report to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and other bodies, as necessary. This will only take place following moderation or quality assurance.</p>

<p>134.	The school will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report, inspection process and findings. We will consider all comments. We will respond to them when we share the final report with the school within 30 working days after the inspection.</p>

<p>135.	If the school wishes to make a formal complaint, it has 5 working days after we have shared the final report with the school (not necessarily the same as 5 school days) in which to do so. If a complaint is not submitted, we will normally publish the report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a> 3 working days later. If a complaint has been submitted, the publication of the report may be delayed.</p>

<p>136.	In all cases, the inspection process should not be treated as complete until all inspection activity has been carried out and we have sent the final version of the inspection report to the school.</p>

<h4>The inspection evidence base</h4>

<p>137.	The evidence base for the inspection must be retained in line with our retention and disposal policy. This is normally 6 years from when the report is published. We may decide that retaining it for longer is warranted for research purposes.</p>

<h4>Quality assurance and complaints</h4>

<p>138.	All inspectors are responsible for the quality of their work. The lead inspector must ensure that inspections are carried out in accordance with the principles of inspection and the code of conduct.</p>

<p>139.	We monitor the quality of inspections through a range of formal processes and HMI/Senior HMI visit some schools, or monitor remotely to quality assure inspections. We may also evaluate the quality of an inspection evidence base. The lead inspector will be responsible for giving team inspectors feedback about the quality of their work and their conduct.</p>

<p>140.	We invite all schools to take part in a voluntary post-inspection survey in order to contribute to inspection development. The link for this survey is provided with the final inspection report to the school.</p>

<p>141.	The majority of our work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns do arise during the inspection, they should be raised with the lead inspector as soon as possible, in order to resolve issues before the inspection is completed. Any concerns raised, and actions taken, will be recorded in the inspection evidence.</p>

<p>142.	If it is not possible to resolve concerns during the inspection, or through submitting comments in response to the draft report, the school may wish to lodge a formal complaint when it receives the final report. The lead inspector will ensure that the school is informed that it is able to make a formal complaint and that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">information about how to complain is available on gov.uk</a>.</p>
