<p>This guidance will come into force on 1 September 2022. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-inspection-handbook">current inspection guidance</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>1.	This handbook describes the main activities carried out during graded, ungraded and urgent inspections of maintained schools and academies in England under sections 5 and 8 of the Education Act 2005, respectively. It sets out the grade descriptors that inspectors use to make their judgements and on which they report. It applies to school inspections under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework">education inspection framework (<abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>2.	Graded inspections are carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005, and were previously known as section 5 inspections. In graded inspections, we use Ofsted’s full framework and grade the school for its overall effectiveness and against our key judgement (and any relevant provision judgement) grade descriptors.</p>

<p>3.	Ungraded inspections are carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005, and were previously known as section 8 inspections of good and outstanding schools. An ungraded inspection differs from a graded inspection, because it does not result in individual graded judgements; instead, it focuses on determining whether the school remains the same grade as it was at its previous graded inspection.</p>

<p>4.	Urgent inspections are also carried out under section 8 of the Education Act 2005, and were previously known as inspections with no fixed designation and unannounced behaviour inspections.</p>

<p>5.	Ofsted may also carry out inspections under section 8 of the Education Act 2005 in order to comply with a request from the Secretary of State under section 118(2) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 for information or advice about maintained schools and academies. We may also carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="#research">research during inspections</a>.</p>

<p>6.	This handbook is primarily a guide for inspectors on how to carry out school inspections. However, we make it available to schools and other organisations to ensure that they are informed about the processes and procedures of inspection. It seeks to balance the need for consistency in inspections with the flexibility required to respond to the individual circumstances of each school. This handbook should be regarded not as a set of inflexible rules, but as an account of the procedures of inspection. Inspectors will use their professional judgement when they apply this guidance in this handbook.</p>

<p>7.	The handbook has 4 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1. How schools will be inspected: this contains information about the processes before, during and after the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2. Explanation of Ofsted’s judgements: this sets out the kinds of evidence that inspectors gather and the activities they carry out to make their judgements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 3. Grade descriptors: this contains the evaluation criteria that inspectors use to make the graded judgements about schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 4. Urgent inspections: this contains the procedures and evaluation criteria for these inspections. It stands alone and therefore may repeat some of the content of part 1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gathering personal information on inspection</h3>

<p>8.	Inspectors will gather any personal information necessary to assist them in inspecting a school. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ofsted-privacy-notices/schools-ofsted-privacy-notice">privacy policy</a> sets out what personal information we collect, what we do with it, how long we keep it and individuals’ rights under data protection legislation.</p>

<p>9.	Individuals and organisations are legally required to provide inspectors with access to information. Section 10 of The Education Act 2005 gives inspectors powers of entry to any premises on which a school provides education to pupils and a right to inspect, and take copies of, any records kept by the school, and any other documents containing information relating to the school, that Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector (<abbr title="Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector">HMCI</abbr>) considers relevant to the discharge of her functions. These powers enable inspectors to look at computers and other devices that may hold relevant information. Regulations enable the Department for Education (<abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>) to provide Ofsted with information on individual pupils where it relates to school inspections.</p>

<p>10.	Inspectors gather evidence on inspection and record this on Ofsted’s systems. They may also see evidence on site that contains personal information about staff and young people, such as registers and lesson plans. Inspectors may take notes from, or copies of, this type of evidence before handing it back to an appropriate staff member at the end of the inspection. Any notes or copies will be stored as evidence securely and not retained by inspectors personally. Inspectors may take photographs of pupils’ work. These photographs will be stored securely as evidence, but will not be retained by the inspector personally.</p>

<p>11.	In most schools, inspectors will gather evidence electronically using a range of devices, including laptops, mobile phones and tablets. Inspectors should transfer evidence securely in line with our security policies.</p>

<h3>Research on inspection</h3>

<p>12.	We may carry out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/research">research</a> during our inspections. Where this happens, the research activity will have no impact on inspection judgements. As our research work is based on our national priorities, we may invite providers to participate in research visits at other times.</p>

<h2>Clarification for schools</h2>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>13.	In this handbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the term ‘governing body’ is used to refer to the accountable authority for the school, which will be the appropriate body for the purposes of section 6 of the Education Act 2006. In the case of an academy, including schools within a multi-academy trust (<abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>), this will be the board of trustees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to parents includes registered parents or carers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> includes multi-academy companies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to a school with serious weaknesses refers to a school that requires significant improvement under section 44 of the Education Act 2005</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any reference to ‘report’ describes the formal written outcome from an inspection, which is usually published</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Common misconceptions about inspection</h3>

<p>14.	The information below confirms our requirements. This is to correct common misconceptions about inspection that can result in unnecessary workload for schools. It is intended to highlight specific practices that we do not require.</p>

<h4>Evidence for inspection</h4>

<p>15.	We do not require schools to do additional work or to ask pupils to do work specifically for the inspection, or create unnecessary workload for teachers through our recommendations.</p>

<p>16.	We will not require schools to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>evidence for inspection beyond that set out in this handbook</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evidence in any specific format, as long as it is easily accessible for inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>written evidence of oral feedback to pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>predictions of attainment and progress scores</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assessment or self-evaluation, other than that which is already part of the school’s business processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>performance and pupil-tracking information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any specific document or plan in relation to the pupil premium other than its pupil premium strategy, and will not require any further school-generated data on the pupil premium</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Involving leaders and governance in inspections</h4>

<p>17.	We will invite the headteacher (or equivalent) and, in academies, the chief executive officer (CEO) or their delegate to observe the inspectors’ final team meeting at the end of each day of the inspection, when one is required. For example, there will be no team meeting if the inspection is carried out by a single inspector.</p>

<p>18.	We will encourage the school to invite as many governors or trustees as possible to meet inspectors during an inspection as observers. These meetings may include a virtual option using video or telephone calls if necessary.</p>

<p>19.	In academies, we expect to meet those directly responsible for management and governance, including the CEO or their delegate (or equivalent), the chair of the board of trustees and other trustees. Inspectors will refer to schemes of delegation when deciding who to speak to.</p>

<h4>Evaluating the quality of education</h4>

<p>20.	We will judge fairly schools that take radically different approaches to the curriculum; inspectors will assess any school’s curriculum favourably when leaders have built or adopted a curriculum with appropriate coverage, content, structure and sequencing and implemented it effectively.</p>

<p>21.	We will not look unfavourably on schools that have adopted curriculum sequences created by others, for example commercial or local schemes. We will look at whatever curriculum the school is using. It is up to schools to determine their practices and it is up to leadership teams to justify these on their own merits rather than referring to this handbook.</p>

<p>22.	We will not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>grade individual lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advocate a particular method of planning (including lesson planning), teaching or assessment, or expect curriculum planning to be in any specific format</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to provide individual lesson plans or previous lesson plans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to provide recordings of live lessons that are delivered remotely, unless they are normally stored for staff or pupils’ future use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to carry out a specified amount of lesson observation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take a random sample of exercise books/folders/sketchbooks/electronic files or evaluate individual workbooks or expect workbooks to be compiled solely to provide evidence for inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use work scrutiny to evaluate teachers’ marking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>specify the frequency, type or volume of marking and feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require schools to ensure a particular frequency or quantity of work in pupils’ books or folders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>require photographic evidence of pupils’ work (although inspectors may ask to take photographs themselves of pupils’ work, and will take all reasonable steps to anonymise these)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Staff information and professional development</h4>

<p>23.	We will not provide schools with any information from any lesson visit with the intention that it be used in capability or disciplinary proceedings or for the purposes of performance management.</p>

<p>24.	We will not routinely check personnel files, although inspectors may look at a small sample.</p>

<p>25.	We will not require schools to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence of the monitoring of teaching, teachers’ professional development or application of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a>, other than that which is already part of the school’s normal activity</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide evidence about each teacher from each of the bulleted sub-headings in the teachers’ standards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide specific details of the pay grade of individual teachers who are observed during inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide anonymised lists of teachers meeting or not meeting performance thresholds for pay progression</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide processes for the performance management arrangements for school leaders and staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> to grade teaching or individual lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>include targets relating to the proportion of good or better teaching in the headteacher’s objectives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set teachers’ performance targets based on commercially produced predictions of pupils’ achievement, or any other data set, from which it would then hold teachers to account</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safeguarding and security</h4>

<p>26.	We expect schools to maintain, as they are required to, a single central record of the safeguarding checks they carry out. We expect <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr> to record this information in a way that allows for details of each individual academy to be provided separately and without delay, even if it is held centrally.</p>

<p>27.	We do not expect, and there is no requirement for, schools to apply retrospectively for Disclosure and Barring Service (<abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr>) and other pre-employment checks for staff who were appointed before <abbr title="Disclosure and Barring Service">DBS</abbr> requirements were introduced, and have been employed continuously since then.</p>

<p>28.	We do not require schools to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take any specific steps with regard to site security; in particular, inspectors do not have a view about the need for perimeter fences or lockdown alarms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use a digital platform to monitor pupils’ internet use, and we do not specify how these platforms should operate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 1. How schools will be inspected</h2>

<h2>Basics of inspection</h2>

<h3>Graded and ungraded inspections</h3>

<p>29.	The <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> and this handbook set out the statutory basis for school inspections carried out under the Education Act 2005.</p>

<p>30.	This section of the handbook applies to graded and ungraded inspections of schools in England under sections 5 and 8 of the Education Act 2005, respectively. The schools subject to inspection under this section of the Act are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>community, foundation and voluntary schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>community and foundation special schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>maintained nursery schools</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>academies, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>sponsor-led academies</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>academy converter schools</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>academy special schools</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>alternative provision academies</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>free schools</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>special free schools</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>university technical colleges (<abbr title="university technical colleges">UTCs</abbr>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>studio schools</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>city technology colleges</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>city technology colleges for the technology of the arts</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>certain non-maintained special schools approved by the Secretary of State under section 342 of the Education Act 1996</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupil referral units (<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>31.	This handbook does not apply to monitoring programmes or inspections, the policy for which can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-monitoring-handbook">monitoring handbook</a>.</p>

<p>32.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-and-skills-inspection-handbook-eif">further education and skills inspection handbook</a> applies to 16 to 19 academies.</p>

<p>33.	We identify a school by its unique reference number (<abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>). Any institution with its own <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> will be inspected in its own right. Schools that work in partnership with other schools, through federations, managed groups, chains or other collaborative activities, but that have a separate <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>, will be inspected as individual schools and separate inspection reports will be published. Schools that work on different sites, or that have different provisions, but share a single <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> will be inspected as one body. We may, however, try to coordinate the inspection of certain groups of schools, where this is possible.</p>

<h4>Graded inspections</h4>

<p>34.	All schools with a judgement of requires improvement or inadequate will receive a graded inspection, as will a selection of schools with an outstanding or good judgement (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#risk-assessment">‘risk assessment’ section</a>). A graded inspection uses our full framework and grades the school against our key judgement (and any relevant provision judgement) grade descriptors, and for its overall effectiveness (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#part-4">part 4</a>).</p>

<h4>Ungraded inspections</h4>

<p>35.	Some good and outstanding schools will receive a graded inspection but many will receive an ungraded inspection instead. An ungraded inspection differs from a graded inspection, because it does not result in individual graded judgements, but focuses on determining whether the school remains the same grade as at the school’s previous graded inspection. It cannot change the overall effectiveness grade of the school. Very occasionally, an ungraded inspection can, however, be ‘deemed’ to be a graded inspection under section 9 of the Education Act (see further details in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#outcome-4">‘ungraded inspection deemed to be a graded inspection section’</a>). Where this is the case, inspectors will make the full set of graded judgements, using the 4-point grading scale required for graded inspections.</p>

<p>36.	Usually, an ungraded inspection will be followed by a further ungraded inspection after approximately a 4-year interval. However, if inspectors find evidence that a school may no longer receive the same grade for overall effectiveness, they will specify that the next inspection should be a graded inspection, with the full range of graded judgements available. This should take place within 1 to 2 years. The <a class="govuk-link" href="#formerly-exempt">‘outstanding schools that were formerly exempt from routine inspections’ section</a> sets out specific temporary rules about some outstanding schools.</p>

<p>37.	As is the case for all schools, a good or outstanding school may still receive an urgent inspection (carried out under section 8) at any time in certain circumstances (<a class="govuk-link" href="#part-4">see part 4</a>). For example, we may decide that we should inspect a school earlier than its next scheduled inspection if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are potential safeguarding issues, including a decline in the standards of pupils’ behaviour and the ability of staff to maintain discipline, and/or welfare concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a subject or thematic survey inspection raises general concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we have received a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">qualifying complaint about the school</a> that, taken alongside other available evidence, suggests that it would be appropriate to do so</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concerns are raised about standards of leadership or governance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>concerns are identified about the breadth and balance of the curriculum (including whether the statutory requirement to publish information to parents is not met)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector">HMCI</abbr> or the Secretary of State have concerns about the school’s performance, or the Secretary of State requests an inspection for any other reason</p>

<h3>Timing of inspection</h3>

<p>38.	An inspection can take place at any point from five school days after the first day pupils attend in the autumn term. For example, if pupils return to school on a Wednesday, an inspection can take place as early as the following Wednesday.</p>

<p>39.	Ofsted is required to inspect at prescribed intervals all schools to which <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/5" rel="external">section 5</a> applies. The law usually requires the maximum interval for inspections to be no more than 5 school years from the end of the school year in which the last relevant inspection took place. However, if a school’s most recent graded or ungraded inspection was before 4 May 2021, the legal maximum for that school will, instead, be up to 7 years.</p>

<p>40.	In November 2021, we committed to inspecting all schools between May 2021 and July 2025. To meet this commitment, we will change our inspection schedule from September 2022 and will increase gradually the amount of graded and ungraded inspections we carry out each year. This will enable us to reduce the inspection interval for those inspected most recently before the COVID-19 pandemic. This means in practice that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>we will inspect outstanding schools in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#formerly-exempt">section below on outstanding schools</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in the 2021/22 academic year, we will have inspected most of the good schools that were last inspected in the 2016/17 academic year, which is an extension of about 5 terms. From the 2022/23 academic year, we will work to gradually reduce this extension. In time, this will mean that we are likely to inspect good schools only 3 to 4 terms later than usual (so around 5 years after their last inspection). For subsequent inspections, we will return to inspecting good schools around every 4 years</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>41.	Before the pandemic, schools judged requires improvement or inadequate could expect a graded inspection approximately 30 months after their last inspection. For their first inspection since inspections were paused in 2020, this will be extended by 5 to 6 terms (so will be around 4 years from their last inspection). They will continue to receive monitoring inspections, as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-monitoring-handbook">monitoring inspection handbook</a>.</p>

<h4>Schools requesting inspection</h4>

<p>42.	Schools are able to request an inspection through the appropriate authority (normally the school’s governing body). This will be a graded inspection. It will be the same as an inspection carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005, although it will technically be carried out under sections 8 and 9. If Ofsted carries out a requested inspection, <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector">HMCI</abbr> may charge the appropriate authority for its cost.</p>

<h4>New schools</h4>

<p>43.	We define a new school as a school with a new <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>. The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> provides all schools with a <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>. If a school changes its status or undergoes significant change and receives a new <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>, it becomes a new school for inspection purposes, except where that school was <a class="govuk-link" href="#formerly-exempt">previously exempt from inspection</a>. If the school retains its <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> following a change, it will be treated as the same school.</p>

<p>44.	Academy schools account for most new schools. These include free schools, former maintained schools that have voluntarily converted to become academies (academy converters), and former maintained schools that were judged as inadequate by Ofsted and were directed by the Secretary of State to become academies.</p>

<p>45.	Judgements made about a predecessor school with a different <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> are not judgements about the new school, even if the new school is, or seems to be,  substantially the same provision. Inspectors may look at the performance of any predecessor school as part of pre-inspection planning. They can look at this data to consider whether the new academy has improved on, or declined from, its predecessor’s performance and whether it has tackled any areas of weakness or built on strengths from the predecessor school. However, inspectors will take care not to give undue weight to any progress or attainment compared with those of the predecessor. Inspectors will not take account of the predecessor’s key judgements or areas for improvement when reaching their judgements about the new school. Inspectors will make clear to the new school the extent to which they have taken account of the performance data from its predecessor school(s) but judgements will be made about the current school only, not the predecessor.</p>

<p>46.	The first inspection of a new school will normally take place within 3 years of its opening. We will not normally select a new school for its first inspection until it is in its third year of operation. These arrangements apply to all new schools that are yet to have their first graded inspection.</p>

<p>47.	We are likely to first inspect new schools that opened before September 2020 in their fourth or fifth year of operation. We are likely to inspect new schools that opened after September 2020 in their third year of operation.</p>

<p>48.	New academy converters whose predecessor schools were judged good or outstanding at their last graded inspection will normally receive an ungraded inspection as their first inspection instead of a graded inspection. However, these schools may receive a graded inspection if we deem it necessary.</p>

<p>49.	We will normally carry out ungraded inspections of academy converters approximately every 4 years. This is in line with ungraded inspections of other good and outstanding schools. However, when carrying out the first ungraded inspection of a new academy, we will consider the inspection history of the predecessor school to decide the timing of the inspection.</p>

<p>50.	For inspections of academy converters that were formerly exempt from routine inspection because their predecessor schools were judged outstanding, the decision on when the first inspection will take place is determined by the most recent inspection of the school’s predecessor school(s). We will also use this to determine whether the first inspection will be a graded or ungraded inspection. Further details are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#formerly-exempt">‘outstanding schools that were formerly exempt from routine inspections’ section</a>.</p>

<p>51.	There are some new academy converters whose predecessor school was judged good, with evidence that it may have improved to outstanding at its most recent ungraded inspection, or the lead inspector was not satisfied that the school would receive at least its current grade if a graded inspection was carried out at that time. In both these circumstances, we informed the predecessor schools that their next inspection would be a graded inspection. If that graded inspection did not happen before the schools converted to academy status, the new academy converter will receive a graded inspection as its first inspection.</p>

<p>52.	In both these circumstances, the graded inspection will normally take place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>no later than the predecessor school would have received the graded inspection if it had not converted to an academy; but</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no earlier than 1 year after the new academy opens</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>53.	The first graded inspection report of a new academy will state ‘not previously inspected as an academy’ (this will not apply if an existing academy is re-brokered and receives a new <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr>). The first graded inspection report of a converter academy will include, in the context section, a statement that follows the example below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Piccadilly Gate Academy converted to become an academy school on 1 September 2019. When its predecessor school, Piccadilly Gate Secondary School, was last inspected by Ofsted, it was judged to be good overall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Risk assessment</h3>

<p>54.	We use risk assessment to ensure that our approach to inspection is proportionate, to focus our efforts on where we can have the greatest impact. We use risk assessment, for example, to determine which good and outstanding schools will receive an ungraded inspection, and which will receive a graded inspection. Risk assessment is a desk-based review of relevant information pertaining to the school.</p>

<p>55.	The indicators that we analyse in our risk assessment are usually the most recent data available at that time. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the data from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> that we normally analyse was not collected in 2020 and 2021. Because of this, we continued to use the risk assessment from 2019, as our analysis showed that this was still the best way to ensure that our approach to inspection is proportionate. Once we receive updated data from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> from 2022 later this year, we will update our risk assessment by analysing this data.</p>

<p>56.	We use a broad range of indicators to select schools for inspection. Therefore, receiving a graded inspection, rather than an ungraded inspection, does not mean that there are significant concerns about a school.</p>

<p>57.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/risk-assessment-methodology-for-maintain-schools-and-academies">risk assessment process</a> normally takes place in time for the start of the third school year after the most recent inspection.</p>

<p>58.	In a risk assessment, we analyse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>data from the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> (for example, progress, attainment, attendance and exclusion data)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>school workforce census data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the views of parents and carers, including those shown by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://parentview.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">Ofsted Parent View</a>, Ofsted’s online questionnaire for parents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>qualifying <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/complain-about-school">complaints</a> about the school referred to Ofsted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupil mobility (this measures the amount of pupils leaving the school before the normal leaving age, or joining after the normal joining age, for that school)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the outcomes of any inspections that we have carried out since the last graded or ungraded inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>statutory warning notices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other significant concerns that are brought to our attention</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Outstanding schools that were formerly exempt from routine inspections</h3>

<p>59.	Between 15 May 2012 and 13 November 2020, mainstream primary and secondary schools judged to be outstanding in their overall effectiveness at their most recent graded inspection were exempt from routine inspections. These schools are now once again <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/1258/made" rel="external">subject to routine inspections</a>. This also applies to academy converter schools that were formerly exempt because the overall effectiveness of their predecessor school was outstanding at its most recent graded inspection.</p>

<p>60.	All formerly exempt schools will receive an initial inspection by July 2025. However, for that inspection they will not be subject to the risk assessment process set out above. Those schools that last received a graded inspection before September 2015 will receive an initial graded inspection. Schools that last received a graded inspection after this date will receive an initial ungraded inspection. If that ungraded inspection indicates that outstanding performance may not have been maintained, we will normally carry out a graded inspection within the next academic year or as soon as possible thereafter and, in any event, before 1 August 2025. Beyond these initial inspections, future inspections of these schools will take place as set out above.</p>

<h4>Provision for 2- and 3-year-olds</h4>

<p>61.	Schools that take 2- and 3-year-olds as part of their early years provision may not need to register that provision with Ofsted. In these cases, we will inspect provision for 2- and 3-year-olds on both ungraded and graded inspections. On graded inspections, inspectors will ensure that the judgement on the effectiveness of early years provision includes an evaluation of the provision for 2- and 3-year-olds. Inspectors will also note if any children receive additional funding.</p>

<p>62.	Any care that a school provides for children in the early years age range, before and/or after the school day or during the school holidays is considered as part of the evaluation of the school’s early years provision.</p>

<h3>Inspections of boarding and residential special schools</h3>

<p>63.	When a boarding or residential special school’s graded or ungraded inspection is due in the same financial year as the full inspection of its boarding or residential provision, we will normally carry out an aligned inspection.</p>

<p>64.	Aligned inspections are carried out by 2 separate inspection teams (education and social care). They result in 2 sets of graded judgements and 2 separate published reports. We will also publish on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a> a summary letter using extracts from both reports.</p>

<p>65.	Inspectors make the judgements for boarding or residential provision in accordance with the guidance and grade descriptors in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-common-inspection-framework-sccif-boarding-schools-and-residential-special-schools">social care common inspection framework (<abbr title="social care common inspection framework">SCCIF</abbr>): boarding schools and residential special schools</a>. Inspectors carry out the inspection of the education provision under the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>.</p>

<p>66.	Education inspectors will consider the impact of the boarding/residential judgements on the overall effectiveness judgement for the whole school. They will take account of the proportion of boarders/residential pupils who also attend the school and the seriousness of any issues found.</p>

<p>67.	In practice, inspectors from both teams will work closely together to plan the inspection activities. They will discuss their findings throughout the inspections. They will normally carry out meetings with key personnel, such as the safeguarding lead(s) and the governors/trustees, together. The 2 teams will share inspection evidence where it is appropriate to do so, for example in assessing the strengths of the links between the day school and the boarding provision.</p>

<p>68.	We will notify the provider of the aligned inspections at around 2pm on the day before both inspections are due to start. The lead education and social care inspectors will then follow this notification call with separate calls to the headteacher and head of boarding, respectively. All inspectors will arrive on site at the same time.</p>

<p>69.	In instances when the boarding/residential inspection is aligned with an ungraded inspection and that inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection, the inspections will cease to be aligned at that point. They will continue as stand-alone events.</p>

<h4>Inspections of schools that are registered as children’s homes</h4>

<p>70.	A graded or ungraded inspection of the education in a school that is also registered as a children’s home may take place as a stand-alone inspection of the education provision or at the same time as the full inspection of the children’s home. When possible, we will attempt to carry out both inspections at the same time so that inspectors may work together and share evidence.</p>

<p>71.	When the education inspection takes place as a stand-alone event, inspectors will read the most recent education and children’s home reports on the preparation day. They must make themselves aware of any current issues concerning children’s welfare that may affect aspects of the school inspection. Inspectors will ensure that they take these into consideration during the inspection.</p>

<h4>Concurrent inspections</h4>

<p>72.	We may schedule inspections at the same time for ‘linked provision’, which is when one or more schools have arrangements to share important aspects of their provision, such as sixth-form programmes or an inclusion unit. Inspectors will make sure that they communicate with each other before and during the inspections. They will also share evidence electronically. Inspectors will ensure that they give sufficient consideration to the emerging judgements of the linked provision.</p>

<h2>Before the inspection</h2>

<h3>Notification and lead inspector’s preparation</h3>

<h4>Notification</h4>

<p>73.	We will normally contact the school by telephone to announce a graded, ungraded or urgent inspection between 10.30am and 2pm on the school day before the inspection.</p>

<p>74.	By exception, we reserve the right to carry out a graded, ungraded or urgent inspection without notice. Where this is the case, the Her Majesty’s Inspector (<abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr>) will normally telephone the school about 15 minutes before arriving on site.</p>

<p>75.	If the headteacher is unavailable when the notification call is made, we will ask to speak to the most senior member of school staff available. Once we have informed the school by telephone that the inspection will take place, we will send confirmation to the school by email.</p>

<p>76.	During the initial notification phone call, we will ask the school to confirm the information we hold about the provision. This will include the number of pupils on roll at the school, the governance arrangements for the school and whether the school has any pupils with special educational needs and/or disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>), nursery provision for 2- and 3-year-olds or additional resource provision.</p>

<p>77.	We will then send the school a letter setting out key information for leaders to be aware of before the inspection. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ofsted’s privacy notice</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing the school that inspectors will use a range of technology to gather evidence electronically</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing the school that inspectors may ask to take photographic evidence, for example of pupils’ work and displays, but that inspectors will not take photographs of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#information-8am">information that the school will need to make available to inspectors at the start of the inspection</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the links to pupil and staff questionnaires, so they can be shared</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Requests for deferral or cancellation</h4>

<p>78.	A school may request a deferral of its inspection. It may make a request to the inspection support administrator during the initial notification phone call, or to the lead inspector on the day it is notified of the inspection. We will not normally consider requests for deferral if we receive them after 4.30pm on the day the school is notified. The inspection support administrator or lead inspector must immediately contact the regional duty desk. We will decide whether to grant a deferral in accordance with our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deferring-ofsted-inspections">deferral policy</a>.</p>

<p>79.	Normally, if the school is providing education to pupils, an inspection will go ahead. In exceptional circumstances, however, an inspection might be cancelled or deferred after the school has been notified, following a request made by the school. We will aim to let the school know whether a request is granted on the same day it is made, but in some cases, particularly when the request for deferral comes later, this may happen by 8am the next morning.</p>

<p>80.	If a school is within 6 months of confirmed closure, and this is evidenced in a funding agreement, for example, but the school does not request a cancellation when the inspector makes contact, the inspection support administrator will call the regional duty desk to highlight this and get advice about whether the inspection should still be carried out. Decisions will be made case by case.</p>

<p>81.	In the case of an inspection without notice, any requests for a deferral will be passed to Ofsted’s relevant regional director, who will decide whether the request can be granted.</p>

<h3>Preparatory telephone call(s) from the lead inspector to the headteacher</h3>

<p>83.	Once we have informed the school of the inspection, the lead inspector will contact the school by telephone and ask to speak to the headteacher. Inspectors’ preparatory telephone conversations with headteachers have 2 elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a short inspection-planning conversation that focuses on practical and logistical arrangements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a longer, reflective, educationally focused conversation about the school’s progress since the last inspection, including how COVID-19 has affected this</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>84.	It may be that both these elements are discussed in a single telephone conversation. Alternatively, they may be carried out as 2 or more separate conversations with a break in between, as agreed between the lead inspector and the headteacher.</p>

<h4>Inspection planning conversation</h4>

<p>85.	This conversation will be short and focused on practical issues. The lead inspector will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>make the school aware of its statutory duty to inform parents of the inspection and that the Ofsted Parent View tool is the main method for gathering the views of parents at the point of inspection; inspectors will remind the school that Ofsted’s letter to parents containing the link to Ofsted Parent View may be sent electronically, or a paper copy may be given to pupils to take home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss the nature of the <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> resource base, if applicable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discuss any nursery provision (see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#nursery">‘Provision for 2- and 3-year-olds’ section</a>), before- and/or after-school care and holiday clubs led and managed directly by the school, particularly if these take <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/factsheet-childcare-registering-school-based-provision">2- to 8-year-olds</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish whether the school is linked to a children’s home, and if so whether the children’s home is managed by the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clarify whether the school has boarding or residential provision, and if so the:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>number of boarding houses or residential units and their addresses</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>number of boarders or residential pupils on roll</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>invite the headteacher and other senior leaders, as agreed by the lead inspector and headteacher, to take part in joint visits to lessons and to observe the inspection team meetings at the end of each day, where these are required</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>establish which approach to the early career framework the school is using for early career teachers (<abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make arrangements for meetings with relevant staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>provide an opportunity for the school to ask any questions or to raise any concerns, such as perceived conflicts of interest</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>where there are children or staff who are particularly at risk from COVID-19, agree safety protocols that the inspection team will follow. Inspectors will follow the latest guidance on testing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>agree whether it may be pragmatic to do some elements of the inspection through video or telephone calls. This will usually only be to involve parents and those with leadership, trust or governance responsibility who are unable to attend</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>86.	The lead inspector will also use the conversation to establish whether the school has any pupils who attend off-site alternative provision, either full time or part time, run either by the school or by a different organisation. If the school uses off-site alternative provision, the lead inspector will request further details about this.</p>

<p>87.	The lead inspector will also ask the school to provide certain information as early as possible to aid preparation. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a copy of the school’s timetable(s), where relevant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>details of any relevant staff absence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether any teachers cannot be observed for any reason (for example, if they are subject to capability procedures)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether there is anyone working on site who is normally employed elsewhere in the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> (if relevant)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>88.	It is important that inspectors speak to those responsible for leadership and governance during inspection. Since schools, and especially <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr>, operate a wide variety of leadership and governance models, it is essential that inspectors establish who is responsible for leadership and governance.</p>

<p>89.	The lead inspector will therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>establish what the governance structure of the school or academy is, with reference to the range of functions delegated to local governing bodies or other committees</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> has delegated responsibilities to local governing bodies, clarify where responsibility lies and who they should talk to during the inspection. This should be set out in a scheme of delegation. Academies should also set out their governance structure in their annual financial statements, which can generally be found on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> performance tables site</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm arrangements for meetings with the school and, in academies, <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> executive leaders, as well as representatives of those responsible for the governance of the school and anyone else the lead inspector thinks relevant. The lead inspector should consult the school as to whom they need to meet with in the structure of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in a maintained school, make arrangements for a meeting with the chair of the governing body or the chair of the board of trustees and as many governors/trustees as possible. Inspectors will also ask the school to invite as many governors/trustees as possible to attend the final feedback meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in an academy, make arrangements for a meeting with the chair of the board of trustees and as many trustees as possible. Inspectors will also ask the school to invite as many trustees as possible to attend the final feedback meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>request either a face-to-face meeting or a telephone call with a representative from the local authority, diocese, sponsor or other relevant responsible body as appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>request that a representative from the local authority, diocese, <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, sponsor or other relevant responsible body is present at the final inspection feedback meeting as appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>confirm that the school is not requesting a deferral</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>90.	If any issues arise, the lead inspector may also need further clarification from the school, for example when information is not available on the school’s website.</p>

<h4>The educationally focused conversation</h4>

<p>91.	Inspectors will use this conversation to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s context, and the progress it has made since the previous inspection, including any specific progress made on areas for improvement identified at previous inspections that remain relevant under the current inspection framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the specific impact of COVID-19 on the school and how the school’s leaders are responding to the ongoing impact. We recognise that responding to COVID-19 has placed great demands on school leaders and detailed discussions of this may be required to understand the school’s context</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher’s assessment of the school’s current strengths and weaknesses, particularly in relation to: the curriculum, the way teaching supports pupils to learn the curriculum, the standards that pupils achieve, pupils’ behaviour and attitudes, and the personal development of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the specific areas or subjects of the school curriculum that should be focused on during inspection – during this call, inspectors will also agree with the head which subjects will receive a deep dive during the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>92.	This conversation will normally last around 90 minutes, but may be longer. It will help inspectors and school leaders to establish a rapport before inspection and give them a shared understanding of the starting point of the inspection. It will also help inspectors to form an initial understanding of leaders’ views on the school’s progress.</p>

<p>93.	This conversation will be used to agree the inspection plan with the headteacher.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> resource bases</h4>

<p>94.	If the school has a <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> resource base delegated to it, that resource base must be inspected. Similarly, where a local authority has direct responsibility for pupils who are at a resource base and also in mainstream classes at the school, that resource base must be inspected. Inspectors will consider evidence about the resource base when making judgements about the school overall.</p>

<p>95.	During the lead inspector’s educationally focused conversation with the school, they will get specific information about any resource base, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the number of pupils and the range of the needs of pupils placed in provision funded from a resource base, together with pupils’ timetables, including when they are taught in mainstream classes (with and without support) and when they receive specialist support in a separate resource base</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the type(s) of language or communication systems used. If the specialist provision is for deaf pupils, it is important to establish, if British Sign Language is used, whether a British Sign Language interpreter will be provided by the school when inspectors are meeting with the pupils. The lead inspector will contact the inspection support administrator as soon as possible if this support is needed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staffing arrangements and details of any outreach services provided by the resource base</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information that schools must provide by 8am on the day of inspection</h3>

<p>96.	The inspection support administrator will also send the school a letter setting out that the following information must be made available to inspectors by 8am the next day, at the formal start of the inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>strategic documents about the school, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>anything that sets out school improvement planning or the longer-term vision for the school, such as the school or the trust’s strategy</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>for maintained schools, minutes of governors’ meetings and other relevant strategic documentation about governance that the school may have</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>for academies, minutes of trust board meetings and other relevant strategic documentation about the trust that the school may have</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>a summary of any school self-evaluation and/or improvement plan or equivalent</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>any reports from any external evaluation of the school</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>records and information about behaviour and attendance, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>up-to-date attendance analysis for all groups of pupils</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of pupils taken off roll</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of exclusions and suspensions, incidents of poor behaviour and any use of internal isolation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of bullying, discriminatory and prejudiced behaviour, either directly or indirectly, including racist, sexist, disability and homophobic/biphobic/transphobic bullying, use of derogatory language and racist incidents</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of sexual harassment and/or sexual violence</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>records and analysis of any restrictive physical intervention</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>operational documents, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>access to wifi, if it exists, so that inspectors can connect to the internet</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>maps and other practical information</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the school timetable, current staff list (indicating <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induction-for-early-career-teachers-england"><abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a>, mentors and induction tutors) and times for the school day, including any planned interruptions to normal school routines during the inspection</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Safeguarding information</h4>

<p>97.	On arrival at the school, inspectors must have secure access to safeguarding information, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the single central record for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of any referrals made to the designated person for safeguarding in the school and those that were subsequently referred to the local authority, along with brief details of the resolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a list of all pupils who have open cases with children’s services or social care and all pupils who have a multi-agency plan</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>98.	Schools and inspectors must ensure that all actions are compliant with legal requirements on information-handling.</p>

<h3>Seeking the views of parents, staff and pupils</h3>

<h4>Seeking the views of parents</h4>

<p>99.	We will provide schools with a letter to pass on to parents that formally notifies them of a graded or ungraded inspection. This letter explains how to use Ofsted Parent View and how parents can contact inspectors. Schools should encourage parents to complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://parentview.ofsted.gov.uk" rel="external">Ofsted Parent View questionnaire</a> by placing a link to it on their website. In addition, inspectors will encourage the school to notify parents using its own electronic systems (such as text messages), if these are available.</p>

<p>100.	Schools will be expected to provide these details to parents on both graded and ungraded inspections. However, schools should note that, for graded inspections, they are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/6" rel="external">required by law to take any reasonably practicable steps to notify the parents of registered pupils at the school</a>, including the parents of those who have been suspended, attend alternative provision or are away from school. Schools are also <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/2038/regulation/4/made" rel="external">required by law to notify relevant bodies</a>, including providers of alternative provision. Similarly, inspectors have a statutory duty to have regard to the views of parents and other relevant persons on graded inspections.</p>

<p>101.	Inspectors will review the evidence from Ofsted Parent View throughout the inspection to ensure that all online responses received during the inspection are taken into account. If the response rate for Ofsted Parent View is low, inspectors may take steps during the inspection to gather further evidence of parents’ views. Inspectors will do this on both graded and ungraded inspections, but it should be noted that inspectors have a specific <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/7" rel="external">statutory duty</a> to have regard of the views of parents and other relevant persons on a graded inspection.</p>

<p>102.	Inspectors will also take into account any other evidence from parents, including the results of any past surveys the school has carried out or commissioned. If individual parents raise serious issues, inspectors will follow these up with the school and record its response.</p>

<p>103.	During aligned inspections of boarding or residential special schools, inspectors will take account of the views that parents have given on Ofsted Parent View about the school’s boarding or residential provision. They will also take account of the views of children and young people who are boarders or residential pupils, and those of boarding staff, which will have been gathered through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-care-online-questionnaires-guidance-for-providers">Ofsted’s annual point-in-time surveys</a>.</p>

<h4>Pupil and staff questionnaires</h4>

<p>104.	The views of pupils and staff in schools are gathered through online questionnaires. The inspection support administrator sends online links to the school with the formal notification of inspection. The school is asked to encourage staff and pupils to complete the online questionnaires, except for those pupils in any boarding provision whose views will have already been sought through the point-in-time survey. Pupils and staff should complete their questionnaires by 3pm on the first day of the inspection. For ungraded inspections of schools with fewer than 150 pupils (which take place over 1 day), questionnaires should be completed by 11am on the day of inspection.</p>

<p>105.	Inspectors may also gather evidence from pupils,  parents or other stakeholders in person. This may include informal meetings at the start and/or end of the day. These meetings must take place without the presence of the headteacher or senior staff. In drawing on evidence from these meetings, every attempt must be made to protect the identity of individuals. There may be circumstances, however, in which it is not possible to guarantee the anonymity of the interviewee. Inspectors have a duty to pass on disclosures that raise child protection or safeguarding issues and/or when there are concerns about serious misconduct, bullying of staff or criminal activity.</p>

<h2>The inspection</h2>

<h3>Timetable of inspection</h3>

<p>106.	Graded and ungraded inspections normally last 2 days. However, an ungraded inspection of a primary school or maintained nursery school with fewer than 150 pupils or children on its roll will normally last for 1 day. The size of the inspection team will vary according to the size and nature of the school. Inspection activity will take place over both days of the inspection.</p>

<p>107.	On each day of the inspection, inspectors will not arrive before 8am and will leave by 6pm except in exceptional circumstances (although they may need to stay later for inspections in boarding and residential schools).</p>

<p>108.	On aligned inspections of boarding and residential special schools, the social care regulatory inspectors may stay into the evening to ensure that they are able to meet boarding or residential pupils and see the boarding or residential provision operating. How long they stay will depend on their lines of enquiry.</p>

<h3>Inspection methodology</h3>

<p>109.	Our framework puts a single, joined-up conversation about education at the heart of inspection, using a 3-part methodology to inspect schools on graded and ungraded inspections. Through this methodology, inspectors build a view of the quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development and leadership and management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>from their pre-inspection preparation and the educationally focused conversation with the headteacher, the lead inspector will form a top-level view – an initial understanding of the curriculum, the way teaching supports pupils to learn the curriculum, the standards pupils achieve, pupils’ behaviour and attitudes, and the personal development of pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inspectors will then collect and connect evidence for each of the judgement areas throughout the on-site part of the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>towards the end of each day, inspectors will bring all the evidence together to draw the conclusions that will inform their final judgements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>110.	Inspectors’ priority during inspections is to collect first-hand evidence.</p>

<h4>Keeping leaders informed</h4>

<p>111.	The lead inspector will meet the headteacher regularly throughout the inspection to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide updates on emerging issues, including initial general findings about the quality of education, and to enable further evidence to be provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow the headteacher to raise concerns, including those related to the conduct of the inspection or of individual inspectors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>alert the headteacher to any serious concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>112.	If, by the end of day 1 or during day 2, there is evidence that the school might be judged as inadequate or requires improvement, the lead inspector will alert the headteacher to this possibility. The inspector must emphasise that they do not make final judgements until the final team meeting at the end of day 2.</p>

<h4>Early career teachers</h4>

<p>113.	Inspectors will meet <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> where possible and may wish to visit lessons given by <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>. When the lead inspector requests a copy of the current staff list, they must ask whether it includes any <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and/or any trainees on placement, including those on School Direct or School Direct (salaried) training routes.</p>

<p>114.	Inspectors will take into account the fact that <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> have less experience than other teachers. However, they must assess the effectiveness of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-career-framework-reforms-overview/early-career-framework-reforms-overview">support and professional development put in place for <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr></a> to ensure that <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach in their chosen subject or phase.</p>

<p>115.	Inspectors should also gather <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>’ views on how the school is supporting their development, including the quality of mentoring and how the school ensures that they access their entitlement to training under the ECF. Inspectors will also discuss how the school supports <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> in managing pupils’ behaviour.</p>

<p>116.	Inspectors will meet with mentors and, where possible, the induction tutor. Inspectors will meet any trainees employed by the school on the School Direct (salaried) route to assess their support, mentoring and induction.</p>

<p>117.	Inspectors will not visit lessons given by trainees. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards">teachers’ standards</a> state that providers will assess trainees against the standards in a way that is consistent with what could reasonably be expected of a trainee teacher before the awarding of qualified teacher status (<abbr title="qualified teacher status">QTS</abbr>). Inspectors will not take trainees’ performance into account when assessing the quality of education.</p>

<h4>Meeting those responsible for governance</h4>

<p>118.	Inspectors will want to meet those responsible for governance during the inspection. In a maintained school, this will usually be the school governors. In a stand-alone academy, this will usually be the academy trustees and sponsors (including sponsor representatives, where they exist).</p>

<p>119.	In a school that is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the board of trustees is the accountable entity and governance body. Often, local governing bodies can appear responsible for governance, when in reality it is trustees who are accountable for the academy trust. Local governing bodies are committees to which trustees have often chosen to delegate some specific responsibilities, but in some cases they may act purely as advisory bodies and engage with the community. Their responsibilities are set out in the trust’s scheme of delegation. Sometimes, their powers are delegated from the managers of the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>; in this case, they are part of the school’s management, not its governance. Inspectors will therefore need to be careful to establish who has overall responsibility for governance. Inspectors will also ensure that meetings are with those who are directly responsible for exercising governance of the school and for overseeing its performance.</p>

<p>120.	Inspectors will take account of the specific context of the school in deciding who to speak to. For example, this may include inviting diocesan representatives for a multi-academy company.</p>

<p>121.	The role that governors and trustees play in the school’s performance is evaluated as part of the judgement on the effectiveness of leadership and management. Reports will often contain a separate paragraph that addresses the governance of the school.</p>

<p>122.	As with meetings with pupils, parents, <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> and staff, meetings or telephone discussions with those responsible for governance should take place without the headteacher or other senior staff being present.</p>

<h3>Other evidence</h3>

<p>123.	Inspectors will also scrutinise a range of school records, documentation and information relating to, for example, pupils’ behaviour, attendance and safeguarding.</p>

<p>124.	We may use the evidence that inspectors gather during inspections to inform other work, such as national reporting, for example our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/ofsted-education-recovery-series">education recovery series</a>.</p>

<h3>Specific matters for graded inspections</h3>

<h4>Inspection of religious education and collective worship</h4>

<p>125.	The Secretary of State <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/31/contents" rel="external">designates certain schools as having a religious character</a>. In a faith school, pupils are educated in the context of the principle of a religion. It is normal for there to be a formal link with a religious organisation. In schools without a religious character, we inspect religious education (<abbr title="religious education">RE</abbr>) and collective worship as part of our graded inspections. This is different in schools with a religious character. In most of these schools, denominational education and collective worship are inspected by a body <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/2038/regulation/9/made" rel="external">appointed by the maintained school’s governing body under section 48 of the Education Act 2005 or as provided in the academy’s funding agreement</a>. In a voluntary controlled school designated as having a religious character, we inspect <abbr title="religious education">RE</abbr>, but not collective worship.</p>

<p>126.	Inspectors may gather evidence from anywhere relevant (including <abbr title="religious education">RE</abbr> lessons and assemblies) to evaluate pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural education, personal development and/or behaviour and attitudes.</p>

<p>127.	The fact that the school has been designated as having a religious character must be referenced in the ‘information about this school’ section of the inspection report.</p>

<p>128.	Section 48 inspections (or the equivalent inspection of an academy) are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1564/made" rel="external">usually carried out every 3 to 5 years</a> (and usually within 2 to 3 years of a new voluntary-aided school or academy or free school opening). Section 48 inspections were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and restarted in September 2021. The first inspection will be within 8 years of the last, rather than the usual 3 to 5 years. The lead inspector on a graded inspection will check the section 48 arrangements. This includes when the next inspection is due and when the last inspection was. They will write about this in the inspection report. They will ensure that the required consultation has taken place with the prescribed faith body, when a school has a prescribed faith body and decides not to use that body’s inspection service but to appoint its own inspector.</p>

<p>129.	Inspectors will familiarise themselves with any issues raised in any section 48 inspection (or equivalent) held since the last Ofsted inspection. Inspectors will not, however, use that evidence in an Ofsted inspection. The lead inspector will note in the inspection report if the section 48 inspection (or equivalent inspection of an academy) is overdue and that, therefore, the school is failing in its statutory duty.</p>

<p>130.	If a section 48 inspection (or equivalent inspection of an academy) happens at the same time as an Ofsted graded inspection, inspectors will mention this in the ‘information about this school’ section.</p>

<h4>Inspection of the school’s approach to harmful sexual behaviour</h4>

<p>131.	On graded inspections, we will look at how leaders ensure that their school’s culture addresses harmful sexual behaviour. Inspectors will expect schools to assume that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence are happening in the community, and potentially in the school, even when there are no specific reports, and put in place a whole-school approach to address them.</p>

<p>132.	Schools should have appropriate and well-communicated school-wide policies in place that make it clear that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence (including sexualised language) are unacceptable. Those policies should be consistently reflected throughout the school (see paragraphs 275, 293, and 354 to 356). The school’s approach will not be inspected separately but will be considered when assessing the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the curriculum in the quality of education judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour policies in the behaviour and attitudes judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pastoral support and <a class="govuk-link" href="#RSE">relationships, sex and health education</a> in the personal development judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="#safeguarding">safeguarding</a> in the leadership and management judgement</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Specific matters for ungraded inspections</h3>

<p>133.	On ungraded inspections, inspectors will normally adopt the same methodology for inspecting the quality of education and safeguarding as that used on a graded inspection outlined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#evaluating-the-quality-of-education">‘quality of education’ section</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#safeguarding">‘safeguarding’ section</a>.</p>

<p>134.	They will also focus on a number of other areas within the graded inspection framework, as set out below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Behaviour – inspectors will not make a judgement on all the criteria contained in the ‘behaviour and attitudes’ judgement. Nevertheless, they will consider 2 key factors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>whether the school has high expectations for pupils’ behaviour and conduct and applies these expectations consistently and fairly. Inspectors will also consider whether this is reflected in pupils’ positive behaviour and conduct. They will consider whether staff make sure that pupils follow appropriate routines, whether low-level disruption is not tolerated and whether pupils’ behaviour does not disrupt lessons or the day-to-day life of the school</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>whether leaders, staff and pupils create a positive environment in which bullying is not tolerated. If bullying, aggression, discrimination and derogatory language occur, they are dealt with quickly and effectively and are not allowed to spread</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gaming and off-rolling – when carrying out inspection activities, inspectors will be particularly alert to any evidence that suggests that the school may be gaming or off-rolling. Definitions of these can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#gaming">‘Evaluating gaming on a graded inspection</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#inclusion">‘Evaluating a school’s approach to inclusion and off-rolling on a graded inspection’</a> sections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ wider development – inspectors will consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the extent to which the curriculum goes beyond the academic, vocational or technical</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>whether the school provides effectively for pupils’ broader development</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>whether the school’s work to enhance pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is of a high quality</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>secondary schools’ approach to careers information, education, advice and guidance (<abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr>). Definitions of this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#careers">‘careers provision’ section</a>. If a school is not meeting its requirements in respect of <abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr>, inspectors will state this in the inspection report</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workload – inspectors will consider the extent to which:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>leaders engage with staff and are aware and take account of the main pressures on them, engaging with them realistically and constructively</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>staff are free from bullying and harassment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>leaders and staff understand the limitations of assessment and use it in a way that will avoid creating an unnecessary burden. Inspectors understand that assessment arrangements may have been altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will seek to understand how staff are supported and the steps that are being taken to remove the risk of additional workload</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>135.	Where the lead inspector has concerns about any of the above, this could be evidence that the school would no longer receive at least its current grade if a graded inspection were to be carried out, and, where those concerns are serious, could suggest that the inspection needs to be deemed a graded inspection.</p>

<h3>Providing feedback</h3>

<p>136.	At the end of the final day of the inspection, inspectors will make an overall evaluation of the evidence. They will record the main points for feedback to the school in the evidence base. The on-site inspection ends with a final feedback meeting with the school. Those connected with the school who may attend include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the headteacher and other senior leaders, as agreed by the lead inspector and headteacher</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for maintained schools, the chair of the school’s governing body and as many governors as possible; the clerk to governors (or equivalent), or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for academies, including academies that are part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the chair of the board of trustees and as many trustees as possible; the clerk to governors or the board (or equivalent), or their delegate, may also attend to take notes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in an academy that is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the CEO or their delegate or equivalent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a representative from the local authority (for maintained schools), sponsor and/or the designated responsible body</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in an aligned inspection, social care regulatory inspectors and education inspectors will feed back together to both education and residential staff</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Due  to the diverse nature of school governance, in some schools a single individual may have more than one of the above roles.</p>

<p>137.	During this meeting, the lead inspector will ensure that the headteacher, those responsible for governance and all attendees are clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>about the key findings from the inspection. The lead inspector must give sufficient detail to enable all attendees to understand how judgements have been reached and for those responsible for the governance of the school to play a part in beginning to plan how to improve</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for graded inspections, about the provisional grades awarded for each key judgement and for overall effectiveness. They will also ensure that schools understand that the grades are provisional and so may be subject to change as a result of quality assurance procedures or moderation and must, therefore, be treated as restricted and confidential to the relevant staff (as determined by the school). They may be shared with all those responsible for the governance of the school, irrespective of whether they attended the meeting, so long as they are clearly marked as provisional, confidential and subject to quality assurance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the main findings of the inspection and the main points provided orally in the feedback, subject to any change, will be referred to in the text of the report, although the text of the report may differ slightly from the oral feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about what the school needs to improve: this will appear in the inspection report as ‘What does the school need to do to improve?’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that, on receiving the draft report, they must ensure that the report is not shared with anyone other than those stated above, or published under any circumstances until the school receives a copy of the final inspection report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that the headteacher is invited and encouraged to complete the post-inspection survey</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the implications of the school being placed in a category of concern if the school is judged to be inadequate, using the wording set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#schools-causing-concern">‘schools causing concern’ section</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when a school requires special measures, whether it may appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> (or in the case of an academy, a recommendation on whether the academy should appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>about the procedure for making a complaint about the inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Procedures when judging a school as inadequate on a graded inspection</h3>

<p>138.	If, by the end of the first day of the inspection or during day 2, the lead inspector thinks it is possible that the school’s overall effectiveness is inadequate and that it might be judged to have serious weaknesses or to require special measures, they must ring Ofsted’s regional duty desk.</p>

<p>139.	The lead inspector will be asked for their name and the name and <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> of the school. They will then be put through to one of the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> on duty. In this call, the lead inspector must talk through the evidence used by inspector(s) in reaching an emerging provisional judgement of inadequate. The overall effectiveness judgement is not confirmed at this point. The lead inspector must record the main points of the conversation in the evidence base.</p>

<p>140.	During the second day of the inspection, the lead inspector may contact the regional duty desk again to discuss emerging findings. If the inspection team has made the provisional judgement that the school is inadequate and has serious weaknesses or requires special measures, the lead inspector must telephone the regional duty desk before the final oral feedback meeting with the school. The lead inspector will be prepared to explain briefly the reasons and underpinning evidence for the inadequate judgement.</p>

<h4>Informing a school that it is deemed to be causing concern</h4>

<p>141.	If a school is provisionally judged to require special measures or to have serious weaknesses, inspectors must use the following words during the final feedback to the school, indicating that the overall effectiveness judgement is subject to moderation by HMIs and, in the case of special measures, agreement by <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector">HMCI</abbr>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the school has serious weaknesses:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In accordance with section 44 of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is likely to be of the opinion that this school has serious weaknesses because it is performing significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances be reasonably expected to perform.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>When the school requires special measures:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">In accordance with section 44 of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector is likely to be of the opinion that this school requires special measures because it is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement in the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>142.	The implications for schools causing concern are set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#schools-causing-concern">‘schools causing concern’ section</a>.</p>

<p>143.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1115/regulation/6/made" rel="external">The Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012</a> state that a maintained school that has been judged to require special measures must not appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> unless <abbr title="Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector">HMCI</abbr> has given permission in writing. When the lead inspector has informed a maintained school that it may not appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, the school must seek approval in writing to the relevant Ofsted regional director and giving supporting reasons if it later wishes to appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>. The restriction on appointing <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> does not extend to trainee teachers who joined employment-based training programmes at the school before the notice (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1662/schedule/2" rel="external">paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to the Qualifications Regulations 2003</a>).</p>

<h2>After the inspection</h2>

<h3>Arrangements for publishing the report</h3>

<p>144.	The lead inspector is responsible for writing the inspection report and submitting the evidence to Ofsted shortly after the inspection ends. The text of the report should explain the judgements and reflect the evidence. The findings in the report should be consistent with the feedback given to the school at the end of the inspection.</p>

<p>145.	Inspection reports will be quality assured before we send a draft to the school. In most circumstances, the school will receive the draft report within 18 working days after the end of the inspection. The draft report is restricted and confidential to the relevant personnel (as determined by the school), including those responsible for governance, and should not be shared more widely or published. We may also send the draft report to the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> and other bodies as necessary. This will only take place following moderation or quality assurance.</p>

<p>146.	The school will have 5 working days to comment on the draft report, inspection process and findings. We will consider all comments. We will respond to them when we share the final report with the school within 30 working days after the inspection.</p>

<p>147.	If the school wishes to make a formal complaint, it has 5 working days after we have shared the final report with the school (not necessarily the same as 5 school days) in which to do so. If a complaint is not submitted, we will normally publish the report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a> 3 working days later. If a complaint has been submitted, the publication of the report may be delayed.</p>

<p>148.	For graded inspections, once a school has received its final report, it is required to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that every parent of a registered pupil at the school receives a copy of the report within 5 working days (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/14" rel="external">section 14(4)(c) of the Education Act 2005</a>). If a complaint is not submitted, we will normally publish the report on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/" rel="external">our reports website</a> 3 working days later. If a complaint has been submitted, the publication of the report may be delayed.’Schools may wish to consider whether emails to parents and/or publication on the school’s website can fulfil this requirement.</p>

<p>149.	In all cases, the inspection process should not be treated as complete until all inspection activity has been carried out and the final version of the inspection report has been sent to the school.</p>

<p>150.	The evidence base for the inspection must be retained in line with our retention and disposal policy. This is normally for 6 years from when the report is published. We may decide that retaining it for longer is warranted for research purposes.</p>

<h3>Quality assurance</h3>

<p>151.	All inspectors are responsible for the quality of their work. The lead inspector must ensure that inspections are carried out in accordance with the principles of inspection and the code of conduct.</p>

<p>152.	We monitor the quality of inspections through a range of formal processes, and <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr>/Senior <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> visit some schools or monitor remotely to quality assure inspections. We may also evaluate the quality of an inspection evidence base. The lead inspector will be responsible for giving team inspectors feedback about the quality of their work and their conduct.</p>

<p>153.	All schools are invited to take part in a voluntary post-inspection survey in order to contribute to inspection development. The link to this survey is provided when the school receives the final copy of its inspection report.</p>

<h3>Handling concerns and complaints</h3>

<p>154.	The great majority of our work is carried out smoothly and without incident. If concerns do arise during the inspection, they should be raised with the lead inspector as soon as possible, in order to resolve issues before the inspection is completed. Any concerns raised, and actions taken, will be recorded in the inspection evidence.</p>

<p>155.	If it is not possible to resolve concerns during the inspection or through submitting comments in response to the draft report, the school may wish to lodge a formal complaint when it receives the final report. The lead inspector will ensure that the school is informed that it is able to make a formal complaint and that <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted/about/complaints-procedure">information about how to complain is available on gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Use of Ofsted logos</h3>

<p>156.	A school judged to be outstanding or good can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://logos.ofsted.gov.uk/using-and-downloading" rel="external">use specific Ofsted logos</a> to promote its judgement, for example on its website. Schools may only use a logo when it reflects the judgement of the most recent graded inspection of that school. They must remove the logo when the school’s <abbr title="unique reference number">URN</abbr> changes, or if their grade changes. More information can be found on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/using-ofsted-logos-and-copyright">our logo terms of use page</a>.</p>

<h2>Inspection outcomes</h2>

<h3>Outcomes of a graded inspection: judgements</h3>

<h4>Schools that are judged outstanding or good</h4>

<p>157.	A school judged to be outstanding or good on a graded inspection will normally receive an ungraded inspection around 4 years later.</p>

<h4>Schools that are judged as requires improvement</h4>

<p>158.	A school that is judged as requires improvement following a graded inspection is a school that is not good but overall provides an acceptable standard of education. The <a class="govuk-link" href="#schools-causing-concern">‘schools causing concern’ section</a> explains ‘acceptable standard of education’. The judgement of requires improvement is not a formal category of concern, but the school may be subject to monitoring by Ofsted. This will not normally apply to a school that has been judged as requires improvement for the first time.</p>

<p>159.	The school will usually receive a graded inspection within 30 months of the publication of the previous report. For the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms.</p>

<p>160.	When the school is judged as requires improvement, inspectors will direct the school to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-monitoring-handbook">Ofsted’s monitoring handbook</a>.</p>

<p>161.	If, at the next graded inspection, the school has not demonstrated that it has improved to good, the lead inspector will need to consider whether it continues to require improvement or may be inadequate. If the school has demonstrated improvement in some areas and there is a general upward trend, but key aspects of performance remain less than good, the school may be judged as requires improvement again. In that case, we will monitor the school before another graded inspection takes place within 30 months of the publication of the previous report (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms). These considerations will be made at each graded reinspection of a school that was previously judged as requires improvement.</p>

<h4>Schools that are judged as inadequate (schools causing concern: special measures and serious weaknesses)</h4>

<p>162.	Schools whose overall effectiveness is judged to be inadequate following a graded inspection will be deemed to be in a formal category of concern.</p>

<p>163.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, but neither quality of education nor personal development is ‘inadequate’, inspectors will conclude that the school is giving an acceptable standard of education and will judge the school to have serious weaknesses.</p>

<p>164.	If the school’s grade either for quality of education or for personal development is ‘inadequate’, inspectors will conclude that the school is failing to give an acceptable standard of education. Inspectors must then consider whether leaders, managers and governors are demonstrating the capacity to improve the school.</p>

<p>165.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, and is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education but managers and governors are demonstrating the capacity to improve, they will judge the school to have serious weaknesses.</p>

<p>166.	If inspectors conclude that the school is inadequate, and is failing to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education and leaders and managers and governors are not demonstrating the capacity to improve the school, then the school will be judged to require special measures.</p>

<h5>Implications for a school causing concern</h5>

<p>167.	Maintained schools and <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> that are judged to be causing concern will be subject to an academy order. The Secretary of State has a duty to make an academy order for all maintained schools judged to have serious weaknesses (‘requiring significant improvement’) and those that require special measures. This includes maintained special schools, but excludes maintained nursery schools and non-maintained special schools. For academies that are causing concern, the Secretary of State has a power to terminate the funding agreement, and the academy may become part of a trust or be rebrokered to another trust.</p>

<p>168.	Maintained schools or <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> that have been issued with an academy order and academies that are being brokered or rebrokered to new sponsors following termination of their funding agreements will normally receive monitoring inspections if they have not been brokered or rebrokered after 9 months.</p>

<p>169.	Whether becoming a new academy or being brokered or rebrokered, these schools will become new sponsored academies. We will then inspect them as new schools within 3 years of operation and normally in the third year (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms). However, in exceptional circumstances, schools that are becoming new academies or being rebrokered may receive an ungraded inspection before their next graded inspection.</p>

<p>170.	Academies judged to have serious weaknesses, and which are not brokered or rebrokered, will be subject to monitoring by Ofsted. They will normally be reinspected within 30 months of the publication of the inspection report in which they were judged to have serious weaknesses (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms).</p>

<p>171.	Academies judged to require special measures, and which are not rebrokered, will be subject to monitoring by Ofsted. The timing of the next graded inspection will be determined by the academy’s rate of improvement. However, it will normally take place within 30 months of the publication of the inspection report that judged it to require special measures (for the first inspection after the pandemic, this period will be extended by up to 6 terms).</p>

<p>172.	Maintained nursery schools and non-maintained special schools judged inadequate are not subject to academy orders. We will monitor them as set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-inspection-handbook-eif/school-monitoring-handbook">monitoring handbook</a>.</p>

<p>173.	<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/15" rel="external">Local authorities or trusts (as appropriate) responsible for an inadequate school are required by law to prepare a statement of action</a> that sets out the action they propose to take, the period within which they propose to take it and the arrangements they propose to make for engaging with parents. This must be sent to Ofsted within 10 working days of the school receiving the final graded inspection report. The statement will form part of the evidence base that will be considered by inspectors when monitoring, alongside any improvement plan prepared by the school.</p>

<p>174.	The law states that <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr> (not including trainee teachers on employment-based training programmes) may not be appointed to maintained schools or <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> judged to require special measures, unless we have given permission in writing. Schools judged to require special measures must apply to us in writing if they wish to appoint <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, stating the reasons for the request.</p>

<h5>Taking a school out of a category of concern</h5>

<p>175.	When an inspection team judges that a school no longer requires special measures, inspectors must use the following words during the final feedback to the school:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>176.	When an inspection team judges that a school previously judged to have serious weaknesses no longer has serious weaknesses, inspectors must use the following words during the final feedback to the school:</p>

<h3>Outcomes of an ungraded inspection</h3>

<p>177.	There are 4 possible outcomes for an ungraded inspection of a good school, 3 of which can apply to an ungraded inspection of an outstanding school.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 1 – the school continues to be a good/outstanding school. This is the most common outcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 2 – the school was previously judged to be good and it remains so, and there is sufficient evidence of improved performance to suggest that it might have been judged outstanding if it had received a graded inspection instead of an ungraded inspection. The school will be informed that its next inspection will be a graded inspection, which will typically take place within 1 to 2 years of the publication of the ungraded inspection report.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 3 – the lead inspector is not satisfied that the school would have received at least its current grade if it had received a graded inspection instead of an ungraded inspection. The school will be informed that its next inspection will be a graded inspection, which will take place within the statutory timeframe, typically within 1 to 2 years of the publication of the ungraded inspection report, depending on how near to the end of the statutory timeframe the ungraded inspection has taken place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outcome 4 – the lead inspector has gathered evidence that suggests that the good or outstanding school may now be inadequate in one or more of the graded judgements under a graded inspection, and there are serious concerns about the quality of education, pupils’ behaviour or safeguarding. The ungraded inspection will usually be deemed to be a graded inspection, usually within 48 hours. Alternatively, for outstanding schools only, there are concerns that the school’s performance could be declining to ‘requires improvement’. Again, the ungraded inspection will usually be deemed to be a graded inspection, usually within 48 hours.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>178.	Inspectors will always report on whether safeguarding is effective. If there is evidence that safeguarding may be ineffective, the lead inspector will always deem the ungraded inspection to be a graded inspection.</p>

<h4>Schools that remain good/outstanding (outcome 1)</h4>

<p>179.	Where the lead inspector judges that a school remains good/outstanding, they will confirm this judgement in the final feedback to the school at the end of the ungraded inspection. The lead inspector will notify their Ofsted regional support team as soon as this decision is made.</p>

<p>180.	A school judged to have remained good or outstanding following an ungraded inspection will normally receive an ungraded inspection around 4 years later.</p>

<h4>Schools that remain good, with marked improvement (outcome 2)</h4>

<p>181.	Where the lead inspector considers that, based on the evidence they have seen, a school remains good and inspectors have reason to believe that the quality of education might have been better than good if the school had received a graded inspection instead of an ungraded inspection, the lead inspector will indicate that this is likely to be their conclusion (subject to quality assurance of the inspection). The lead inspector will then discuss with the school which topics or areas of provision may usefully serve as the focus of a subsequent graded inspection, and record this in their evidence.</p>

<p>182.	The school will then receive a report that makes clear that its next inspection will be a graded inspection. The report will confirm that the school remains good and will highlight the reasons why inspectors believe that the quality of education is better than good.</p>

<p>183.	The graded inspection will usually take place within 1 to 2 years after the publication of the ungraded inspection report, giving the school time for the strong practice and marked improvements to be consolidated. The decision on the timing of the full graded inspection will be for the relevant Ofsted regional director to determine. Schools may request an early inspection and these requests will be considered by the relevant Ofsted region.</p>

<p>184.	The relevant regional director may choose to carry out an ungraded inspection instead, which can be up to 4 years after publication of the original ungraded inspection report, if they believe that a graded inspection is likely to serve no useful purpose (as in, it is likely to yield a further judgement of good). This decision would normally follow a request from a school where the school does not believe it would be likely to receive an outstanding judgement at a graded inspection. We will not draw any conclusions solely from a school making a request. The decision is always at the discretion of the regional director, and they must first assure themselves there is no evidence that the school has declined below good.</p>

<h4>Schools that may no longer be good/outstanding (outcome 3)</h4>

<p>185.	Where the lead inspector is not satisfied that the school would receive its current grade if a graded inspection was carried out at the time of the ungraded inspection, the lead inspector will indicate that this is likely to be their conclusion (subject to quality assurance of the inspection). The lead inspector will then discuss with the school which subjects, themes or areas of a school’s work may usefully serve as a starting point for a subsequent graded inspection, and record this in their evidence.</p>

<p>186.	The school will then receive a letter setting out what the school is doing well and what it needs to improve. The school’s current overall effectiveness judgement will not change as a result of the ungraded inspection.</p>

<p>187.	The school will subsequently receive a graded inspection, which will typically take place within 1 to 2 years of the publication of the ungraded inspection report.</p>

<p>188.	It may be sooner, however, in order to comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/170/contents/made" rel="external">The Education (School Inspection) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2015</a>, which require a graded inspection in these schools within 5 school years from the end of the school year in which the previous inspection took place (this will be 6 years for the school’s first inspection following the COVID-19 pandemic). This means that, for a small number of schools, the follow-on graded inspection may be carried out sooner than the usual 1 to 2 years after the inspection has taken place.</p>

<p>189.	For outcomes 2 and 3, if a maintained school converts to become an academy before the graded inspection has been carried out, the school’s first inspection as a new academy will be a graded inspection at least 1 year after the school becomes an academy.</p>

<h4>Ungraded inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection (outcome 4)</h4>

<p>190.	The ungraded inspection will be deemed to be a graded inspection, usually within 48 hours, if there are serious concerns about the quality of education, behaviour, potential gaming (including off-rolling) or safeguarding. This will occur if inspectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>find evidence that suggests that the ‘quality of education’ might be judged to be inadequate were a full graded inspection to take place at the time of the ungraded inspection. This may include a situation where the range of subjects being taught is very narrow (taking any COVID-19 catch-up factors into consideration)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find evidence relating to behaviour that suggests that ‘behaviour and attitudes’ might be judged to be inadequate if a graded inspection was to take place at the time of the ungraded inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find evidence that suggests that the school has removed pupils from the school roll without a formal, permanent exclusion, or encouraged parents to remove their child from the school roll, when the removal is primarily in the interests of the school rather than in the best interests of the pupil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find evidence that deliberate gaming is taking place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>find evidence indicating that safeguarding may be ineffective</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>191.	The ungraded inspection will also be deemed to be a graded inspection (under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/section/9" rel="external">Education Act 2005</a>) when the lead inspector has gathered evidence that suggests that the school would be inadequate in one or more of the graded judgements if it had received a graded inspection instead of an ungraded inspection.</p>

<p>192.	A decision to deem the inspection to be a graded inspection does not predetermine the outcome of the graded inspection. At the end of the graded  inspection, the school may receive any grade along the 4-point grading scale.</p>

<p>193.	If inspectors gather evidence that suggests an outstanding school’s performance may have declined so that if a graded inspection was to be carried out at the time of the ungraded inspection, the school would likely be judged as requires improvement, inspectors will deem the ungraded inspection to be a graded inspection, usually within 48 hours.</p>

<p>194.	Where the ungraded inspection is <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr>-led and is deemed to be a graded inspection, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will remain the lead inspector for the graded inspection. However, where the ungraded inspection has been led by a contracted Ofsted Inspector (OI), the OI may either remain as the lead inspector for the graded inspection or an <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> may lead the graded inspection. More inspectors may join the lead inspector. The ungraded inspection will become a graded inspection, and the team will gather and evaluate evidence in order to make a full set of graded judgements.</p>

<p>195.	An ungraded inspection report will not be produced when the ungraded inspection is deemed to be a graded inspection. Instead, the school will receive a graded inspection report.</p>

<h2>Part 2. Explanation of Ofsted’s judgements</h2>

<p>196.	This section of the handbook sets out how we evaluate schools on the 2 most common types of inspection: graded inspections and ungraded inspections.</p>

<p>197.	Inspectors evaluate schools against the following key judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>198.	The ‘Evaluating the quality of education’ section applies to both graded and ungraded inspections. The other judgement sections are split into specific graded inspections and ungraded inspections sections.</p>

<p>199.	The majority of inspections that we carry out are ungraded inspections. The purpose of these inspections is to confirm whether a school remains good or outstanding under the definition of overall effectiveness set out in the grade descriptors in part 3. These differ from graded inspections, where inspectors make an overall effectiveness judgement, as well as the other 4 key judgements set out in part 3.</p>

<h2>Evaluating the quality of education</h2>

<h3>The curriculum</h3>

<p>200.	A school’s curriculum sets out the aims of a programme of education. It also sets out the structure for those aims to be implemented, including the knowledge and skills to be gained at each stage. It enables the school to evaluate pupils’ knowledge and skills against those expectations.</p>

<p>201.	All pupils in maintained mainstream schools are expected to study the basic curriculum, which includes national curriculum, religious education and age-appropriate relationships and sex education. The national curriculum sets out requirements for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>English, mathematics, science, physical education and computing in key stages 1 to 4</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>art and design, design and technology, geography, history and music in key stages 1 to 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>languages in key stages 2 and 3</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>citizenship in key stages 3 and 4</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>202.	Since September 2020, schools have also been required to teach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>relationships education (key stages 1 and 2)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>relationships and sex education (key stage 3 and 4)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>health education (key stages 1 to 4)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>203.	Academies are expected to offer all pupils a broad curriculum that should be similar in breadth and ambition to the national curriculum, and must include English, mathematics, science and religious education.</p>

<p>204.	All schools that include early years provision must comply with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">statutory framework for the early years foundation stage (<abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<p>205.	In key stage 1, pupils should be able to read, write and use mathematical knowledge, ideas and operations so that they are able to access a broad and balanced curriculum at key stage 2. Some schools are exempt from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>. Where this is the case, the expectation is that pupils are able to read and write fluently by Years 5 and 6.</p>

<p>206.	In key stages 2 and 3, schools need to provide a broad, rich curriculum. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/hmcis-commentary-october-2017">Our research into the curriculum</a> shows that these stages are particularly susceptible to a narrow curriculum, and that this has a disproportionately negative effect on the most disadvantaged pupils. If a school has shortened key stage 3, inspectors will look for evidence that the school has made provision to ensure that pupils still have the opportunity to study a broad range of subjects, commensurate with the national curriculum, in Years 7 to 9.</p>

<p>207.	In the key stage 4 curriculum, the government’s national ambition is that 90% of Year 10 pupils in state-funded mainstream schools should be starting to study <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr> GCSE courses nationally by 2025 (taking their examinations in 2027). This is an ambition, and not a target for any individual school. Inspectors will not make a judgement about the quality of education based solely or primarily on the school’s progress towards the <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr> ambition. Nevertheless, it is an important factor in understanding a school’s level of ambition for its pupils. It is, therefore, important that inspectors understand what schools are doing to prepare for this, and they should take those preparations into consideration when evaluating the intent of the school’s curriculum.</p>

<p>208.	All schools are also required to promote the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society; and prepare pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life.</p>

<p>209.	If remote education is in place, schools should ensure that it is well integrated within their course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum.</p>

<p>210.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> has set out a minimum expectation of at least 32.5 hours for the length of the school week in mainstream state-funded schools by 1 September 2023 at the latest. Where it is clear that increasing the overall time pupils spend in school (to at least 32.5 hours per week) would improve the quality of education, inspectors will reflect this in their evaluation of the school, and in the inspection report. If a school is not meeting the minimum expectation, and this impacts on the quality of education, inspectors will expect schools to set out a clear rationale for this and understand what impact it has on the quality of education. They will also want to understand what plans are in place to meet the minimum expectation.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating the curriculum</h3>

<p>211.	Inspectors will consider the knowledge and skills that pupils will gain at each stage through the school’s curriculum (we call this ‘intent’). They will look at the scope of the curriculum, including how carefully leaders have thought about what end points the curriculum is building towards (with reference to the national curriculum and, where relevant, the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>). They will also look at how leaders have broken down the content into components and sequenced that content in a logical progression, systematically and explicitly, for all pupils to acquire the intended knowledge and skills. Inspectors will also consider the rigour of subject-specific planning.</p>

<p>212.	Inspectors will consider how the curriculum developed or adopted by the school is taught and assessed in order to support pupils to build their knowledge and to apply that knowledge as skills (we call this ‘implementation’). This includes how well the subject curriculum is presented to ensure that pupils understand key concepts, and that they can transfer key knowledge to long-term memory and apply it fluently. This includes the use of assessment to check pupils’ understanding of what the curriculum intent says they should know, and to identify and correct misunderstandings and inform teaching. It also includes whether teachers either have expert knowledge of the subjects that they teach, or are supported to address gaps in their knowledge so that pupils are not disadvantaged by ineffective teaching.</p>

<p>213.	Finally, inspectors will consider the outcomes that pupils achieve as a result of the education they have received (we call this the ‘impact’). This will include their view of how pupils are progressing through the curriculum, and their view on schemes of work or other long-term planning (in whatever form subject leaders normally use them).</p>

<p>214.	Inspectors will focus on what our inspection experience and research show are the most important factors to consider. These are the extent to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>is ambitious and designed to give pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, the knowledge they need to take advantage of opportunities, responsibilities and experiences in later life</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>is planned and sequenced so that the end points that it is building towards are clear and that pupils develop the knowledge and skills, building on what has been taught before, to be able to reach those end points</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has rigour, where relevant, so that pupils learn the knowledge that they need to answer subject-specific questions and to gain disciplinary knowledge of how the subject works (this should not prevent a topic-based or thematic approach, however)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>accounts for delays and gaps in learning that have arisen and continue to arise as a result of the pandemic</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>remains as broad as possible for as long as possible, including when delivered remotely. The school does not offer disadvantaged pupils or pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> an ungraded curriculum</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teachers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>have expert knowledge of the subjects that they teach and are supported, where necessary, to address gaps in their knowledge so that pupils are not disadvantaged by ineffective teaching</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>present information clearly, promote appropriate discussion, check pupils’ understanding systematically, and identify misunderstandings and adapt teaching as neccesary to correct these</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>deliver the subject curriculum in a way that allows pupils to transfer key knowledge to long-term memory. Teaching is sequenced so that new knowledge and skills build on what has been taught before and pupils can work towards clearly defined end points</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>use assessment to check pupils’ understanding to inform teaching, and to help pupils embed key concepts, use knowledge fluently and develop their understanding, and not simply memorise disconnected facts</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>consider the most important knowledge or concepts that pupils need to know and focus on these, and prioritise feedback, retrieval practice and assessment</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ensure that remote education, if needed, enables all pupils to access lessons and learn, and monitor pupils’ engagement and communicate with parents and colleagues effectively if there are concerns</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>acquire the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>make progress, in that they know more, remember more and are able to do more. They are learning what is intended in the curriculum</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>produce work of high quality</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>achieve well in national tests and examinations, where relevant</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>are being prepared for their next stage of education, training or employment at each stage of their learning, including whether pupils in sixth form are ready for the next stage and are going on to appropriate, high-quality destinations</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>are able to read to an age-appropriate level and fluency (if not, they will be incapable of accessing the rest of the curriculum, and they will fall rapidly behind their peers)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>215.	In evaluating the quality of education, inspectors will form a top-level view of the curriculum through conversations with senior leaders and through data. They will use the official <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> as a starting point, but will want to see the quality of education as experienced by pupils first hand and understand how well leaders know what it is like to be a pupil at the school. Inspectors’ understanding of the school’s curriculum is primarily formed through deep dives. We will look at the curriculum in all the key stages that the school has, through our deep dives. Inspectors will use 2022 outcomes cautiously and  2021/22 data will only be used to inform discussion with the schools about pupil outcomes. No schools will be marked down on the basis of the 2021/22 data alone.</p>

<p>216.	The number of deep dives will vary depending on the size of the school and the inspection team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in primary schools (and infant, junior and lower-middle schools), inspectors will always carry out a deep dive in reading and deep dives in one or more foundation subjects. In addition, inspectors will often carry out a deep dive in mathematics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in secondary schools, the deep dives will typically focus on a sample of 4 to 6 subjects, looking at a wide variety of pupils in different year groups across that sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in small schools (with fewer than 150 pupils), the methodology will be adapted to reflect the shorter inspection (only 1 day)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for maintained nursery schools and specialist settings, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#provision-specific">‘Provision-specific considerations’ section</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>217.	Deep dives gather evidence of the curriculum within a certain subject, to build an understanding of the curriculum in the school as a whole. They encompass a range of activities, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>talking about the curriculum with leaders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>joint visits to lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work scrutiny</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>talking to and observing pupils in addition to joint visits to lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with teachers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>218.	Inspectors may not always carry out all of these activities on a deep dive. More detail on these activities can be found in the sections below.</p>

<p>219.	Inspectors will not grade intent, implementation and impact separately and will not grade individual lessons or teachers. Instead, inspectors will reach a single graded judgement for the quality of education, drawing on all the evidence they have gathered and using their professional judgement.</p>

<p>220.	Inspectors recognise that there may still be some limited circumstances in which a pupil may need to learn remotely. Where this is the case, this learning will not be evaluated separately but as part of the wider curriculum. Similarly, where the school is directly deploying tutors to support education recovery from the pandemic, inspectors will consider how this supports the aims of the school curriculum, rather than evaluate the quality of the tutoring. Use of tutors will be integrated into the evaluation of both the quality of education and leadership and management and will not be inspected separately.</p>

<p>221.	Inspectors will not look at non-statutory internal progress and attainment data on inspections of schools. That does not mean that schools cannot use data if they consider it appropriate. Inspectors will, however, put more focus on the curriculum and less on schools’ generation, analysis and interpretation of data. Teachers have told us that they believe this will help us play our part in reducing unnecessary workload. Inspectors will be interested in the conclusions drawn and actions taken from any internal assessment information, but they will not examine or verify that information first hand. Inspectors will use published national performance data as a starting point on inspection, where it is available.</p>

<p>222.	Inspectors will be alert to unnecessary or excessive attempts to simply prompt pupils to learn glossaries or long lists of disconnected facts. Learning can be defined as an alteration in long-term memory. If nothing has altered in long-term memory, nothing has been learned. However, pupils learn by connecting new knowledge with existing knowledge. Pupils also need to develop fluency and unconsciously apply their knowledge as skills. This must not be reduced to, or confused with, simply memorising disconnected facts. When inspectors evaluate the impact of the education provided by the school, their focus will primarily be on what pupils have learned.</p>

<p>223.	We will judge schools taking radically different approaches to the curriculum fairly. We recognise the importance of schools’/trusts’ autonomy to choose their own curriculum approaches. If leaders are able to show that they have thought carefully, that they have built a curriculum with appropriate coverage, content, structure and sequencing, and that it has been implemented effectively, and that the curriculum does not leave some pupils behind, then inspectors will assess the school’s curriculum favourably.</p>

<p>224.	Inspectors will recognise that some schools are going through a period of change, including when they have been brokered into a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> or rebrokered from one <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> to another. In some schools, the quality of education may have been poor and may now be showing significant and sustained improvement. In these situations, nationally generated performance data may lag behind the current quality of education in the school and so inspectors will view the national data in this context.</p>

<p>225.	Inspectors will also bear in mind that developing and embedding an effective curriculum takes time, and that leaders may only be part-way through the process of adopting or redeveloping a curriculum. If leaders have an accurate, evaluative understanding of current curriculum practice in their school and have identified appropriate next steps (taking into account any impact of COVID-19) to improve curriculum quality and develop curriculum expertise across the school, inspectors will evaluate ‘intent’ favourably when reaching the holistic quality of education judgement. They will recognise that the criteria for a judgement of good are the best fit. Where inspectors consider available national data, they will be mindful of the age of this data, especially around statutory assessment and qualifications, when making judgements. Teacher-assessed grades from 2020 and 2021 will not be used to assess curriculum impact.</p>

<p>226.	As part of making the judgement about the quality of education, inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life. Our understanding of ‘knowledge and cultural capital’ is derived from the following wording in the national curriculum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">It is the essential knowledge that pupils need to be educated citizens, introducing them to the best that has been thought and said and helping to engender an appreciation of human creativity and achievement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>227.	National assessments and examinations are useful indicators of pupils’ outcomes, but they only represent a sample of what pupils have learned. Inspectors will consider any outcomes data, where this is available in published national data (this does not include teacher- or centre-assessed grades from 2020 and 2021), but it does not constitute a substitute for inspectors’ first-hand inspection activities.</p>

<h4>Talking about the curriculum with leaders</h4>

<p>228.	Talking to relevant leaders is vital to understanding the curriculum within that subject. Inspectors understand that subject leadership works differently in different schools – especially smaller schools – and will work within that context in each school.</p>

<p>229.	Inspectors will want leaders to set out the scope of what they intend pupils to learn. This will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which there are clear end points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether subject content is broken down into appropriately sized steps and sequenced to build towards those end points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the rigour of subject-specific planning, where appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>230.	We define rigour as ensuring that the curriculum keeps to subject-specific questions, methods, conventions, rules and practices and how the subject discipline builds new knowledge. This should not prevent a topic-based or thematic approach, however. Inspectors will also want to understand the approach to teaching and assessing whether pupils have understood the content they have been taught.</p>

<h4>Joint visits to lessons</h4>

<p>231.	Inspectors will not take a random sample of lessons to visit. Instead, they will connect lesson visits to other evidence, such as discussions with curriculum leaders, teachers and pupils, and work scrutiny.</p>

<p>232.	Inspectors will discuss with leaders what lessons will be visited as part of the deep dive to see the curriculum in action. Where possible, inspectors will visit several lessons from the same curriculum area or subject, including from different year groups. They will invite the headteacher, subject leaders and/or other leaders to take part in joint visits to lessons.</p>

<p>233.	Lesson visits are not about evaluating individual teachers or their teaching. Teaching will not be graded. Inspectors will connect evidence from lesson visits with what they learn from other deep dive activities, to form a rounded view of the quality of education.</p>

<p>234.	Lesson visits are also useful for gathering evidence that contributes to the ‘behaviour and attitudes’ judgement by providing direct evidence about how behaviour is managed within individual classrooms and how pupils respond. This evidence will complement the other evidence that inspectors gather about behaviour during inspection.</p>

<h4>Work scrutiny</h4>

<p>235.	Inspectors will look at pupils’ work. Work scrutiny will help inspectors to form a view of whether pupils know more and can do more, and whether the knowledge and skills they have learned are well sequenced and have developed incrementally.</p>

<h4>Talking to and observing pupils in addition to joint visits to lessons</h4>

<p>236.	Inspectors will ask to speak to groups of pupils, including about the subjects they have been looking at. They will want to understand what pupils have learned and how their teachers help them to learn new curriculum content. Inspectors will take advantage of opportunities to gather evidence from a wide range of pupils, both formally and informally.</p>

<p>237.	Inspectors will also talk to and observe pupils in a range of situations outside of normal lessons to evaluate other aspects of personal development, behaviour and attitudes, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>at the start and finish of the school day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during lunchtime, including in the dining hall, and breaktimes or playtimes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during assemblies and tutor periods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when moving between lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>during enrichment activities (including clubs and activities outside of the normal timetabled curriculum)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>238.	During informal conversations with pupils, inspectors will ask them about their experiences of teaching, learning and behaviour in the school, including the prevention of bullying and how the school deals with any form of harassment and violence, discrimination and prejudiced behaviour, if they happen. Inspectors will ensure that all questions are appropriate.</p>

<p>239.	During the inspection, it is important that pupils are able to express their views freely to inspectors. Therefore, inspectors must have the opportunity to speak to pupils with no other adults present. This is particularly important when inspectors ask pupils questions about safeguarding. Inspectors will also try to ensure that they speak to at least some single-sex pupil groups to provide the opportunity for pupils to speak more freely about issues such as sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspectors-talking-to-pupils-on-inspection">‘Inspectors talking to pupils on inspection’</a>.</p>

<h4>Discussions with staff</h4>

<p>240.	Inspectors will discuss with staff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how the school’s curriculum informs their choices about content and sequencing to support pupils’ learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the training and support that they receive helps them to deliver the content effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>their workload, including whether assessment practices create any unnecessary burdens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>other matters, including those related to safeguarding and pupils’ behaviour</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Early stages of learning to read</h4>

<p>241.	During all inspections, inspectors will be interested in how the school supports pupils who are at the early stages of learning to read, including older pupils. This is especially the case because of the disruption to learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>242.	On inspections of infant, junior, primary and lower-middle schools, inspectors will carry out a deep dive to evaluate how well pupils are taught to read. They will pay particular attention to pupils who are reading below age-related expectations (the lowest 20%) to assess how well the school is teaching phonics and supporting all children to become confident, fluent readers. This will include understanding how reading is taught remotely, where applicable.</p>

<p>243.	Inspectors will listen to several low-attaining pupils in Years 1 to 3 read from unseen books that are appropriate to their stage of progress. They should also draw on information from the school’s policy for teaching reading, phonics assessments, phonics screening check results and lesson visits.</p>

<p>244.	Wherever possible, inspectors will listen to children read to a familiar adult in a classroom or in an open area that the pupils are familiar with. They will take into consideration the length of time a pupil has attended the school.</p>

<p>245.	In reaching an evaluation against the ‘quality of education’ judgement, inspectors will consider whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the school is determined that every pupil will learn to read, regardless of their background, needs or abilities. All pupils, including the weakest readers, make sufficient progress to meet or exceed age-related expectations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stories, poems, rhymes and non-fiction are chosen for reading to develop pupils’ vocabulary, language comprehension and love of reading. Pupils are familiar with and enjoy listening to a wide range of stories, poems, rhymes and non-fiction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s phonics programme matches or exceeds the expectations of the national curriculum and the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> early learning goals. The school has clear expectations of pupils’ phonics progress term by term, particularly from Reception to Year 2</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the sequence of reading books shows a cumulative progression in phonics knowledge that is matched closely to the school’s phonics programme. Teachers give pupils sufficient practice in reading and re-reading books that match the grapheme–phoneme correspondences they know, both at school and at home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reading, including the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics, is taught from the beginning of Reception</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in Reception, staff teach children to read systematically by using synthetic phonics and books that match the children’s phonic knowledge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the ongoing assessment of pupils’ phonics progress is sufficiently frequent and detailed to identify any pupil who is falling behind the programme’s pace. If they do fall behind, targeted support is given immediately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school has developed sufficient expertise in the teaching of phonics and reading</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Mathematics</h4>

<p>246.	When inspectors look at mathematics, they will evaluate the quality of a school’s mathematics education through lesson visits, discussions with pupils and scrutiny of their work, discussions with subject leaders, and examining any published data. This will include understanding how mathematics is taught remotely, where applicable.</p>

<p>247.	Inspectors will consider what steps the school has taken to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pupils understand and remember the mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures appropriate for their starting points, including knowledge of efficient algorithms. This should also ensure that pupils are ready for the next stage, whether that is the next lesson, unit of work, year or key stage, including post-16 mathematics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum planning for mathematics carefully sequences knowledge, concepts and procedures to build mathematical knowledge and skills systematically and, over time, the curriculum draws connections across different ways of looking at mathematical ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the curriculum divides new material into manageable steps lesson by lesson</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s curriculum identifies opportunities when mathematical reasoning and solving problems will allow pupils to make useful connections between identified mathematical ideas or to anticipate practical problems they are likely to encounter in adult life. Pupils have sufficient understanding of, and unconscious competence in, prerequisite mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures that are necessary to succeed in the specific tasks set</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>within the curriculum, there are sufficient opportunities planned to revisit previously learned knowledge, concepts and procedures; this is to ensure that, once learned, mathematical knowledge becomes deeply embedded in pupils’ memories. This then allows rapid and accurate recall and frees pupils’ attention so they can work with increasing independence, apply their mathematical knowledge to more complex concepts, procedures and opportunities for problem-solving, and gain enjoyment through a growing self-confidence in their ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there is flexibility in curriculum planning so that the school can address identified gaps in pupils’ mathematical knowledge that hinder their capacity to learn and apply new content. Those pupils behind age-related expectations are provided with the opportunities to learn the mathematical knowledge and skills necessary to catch up with their peers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are objective assessments that can identify when all pupils have gained the intended understanding and unconscious competence in knowledge, concepts and procedures necessary before they move on to new or more complex content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>teaching models new procedures and uses resources and approaches that enable pupils to understand the mathematics they are learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all teachers of mathematics, including non-specialist teachers of mathematics, have sufficient mathematical and teaching content knowledge to deliver topics effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupils’ mathematical knowledge is developed and used, where appropriate, across the curriculum</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in both mainstream and specialist settings</h3>

<p>248.	All parts of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> apply to state-funded and non-maintained special schools provision, <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr>, alternative provision and mainstream schools’ provision for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>. However, as with all provision, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> provision has some specific factors that should be taken into account.</p>

<p>249.	Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> have a range of different needs and starting points. Pupils will have unique, individual needs, even where their needs may fall under the same umbrella term, such as autism. Some pupils have severe, complex or profound needs that have a significant impact on their cognitive development, especially the way that they are able to make alterations to their long-term memory. Other pupils have starting points at least as high as other pupils of their age, for instance some pupils with sensory impairments.</p>

<p>250.	Inspectors will gather and evaluate evidence about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders are suitably ambitious for all pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders identify, assess and meet the needs of pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, including when pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are self-isolating and/or receiving remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that the curriculum is coherently sequenced to meet all pupils’ needs, starting points and aspirations for the future</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how successfully leaders involve parents, carers and, as necessary, other professionals/specialist services in deciding how best to support pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, including agreeing the approach to remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders include pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in all aspects of school life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of any different or additional provision being made for them, including any reasonable adjustments in remote education provision. This covers outcomes in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>communication and interaction</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cognition and learning</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>physical health and development</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>social, emotional and mental health</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> are prepared for their next steps in education, employment and training, and their adult lives, including: further/higher education and employment, independent living, participating in society and being as healthy as possible in adult life. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/send-code-of-practice-0-to-25">‘Special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years’</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>251.	Because of the wide range of pupils’ needs, inspectors will not compare the outcomes achieved by pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> with those achieved by other pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in the school, locally or nationally.</p>

<p>252.	Pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> often have significant and complex vulnerabilities and can face additional safeguarding challenges. This includes understanding and pre-empting increased risks that pupils may be drawn into harmful situations as a result of grooming, be more likely to experience abuse from other pupils or adults, and may experience additional barriers in reporting abuse and having abuse recognised by professionals. Inspectors will evaluate the ways in which leaders have made appropriate and effective safeguarding arrangements that reflect these additional vulnerabilities, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h4>Specialist settings</h4>

<p>253.	All parts of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> apply to special schools, <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and other alternative provision in free schools and academies. In special schools, the curriculum may be very specialised. For this reason, in special schools, deep dive areas may not be traditional subject areas. The lead inspector will seek to understand the school’s curriculum during the initial phone call with the headteacher. Once the lead inspector has understood the school’s curriculum design, the areas for a deep dive will be agreed. These may include national curriculum subjects, may derive from the 4 broad areas of need (for example, communication and interaction or physical development), may be a curriculum area very specific to that school or may be combination of these examples. Inspectors will work closely with leaders and staff to understand how the curriculum area they are looking at is designed and implemented to meet the needs of pupils in the school. Inspectors will evaluate whether pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of the curriculum.</p>

<p>254.	The government’s ambition for <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr> does not apply to special schools with secondary-age pupils. In addition, the Progress 8 accountability measure may not always be the most appropriate performance indicator for these schools.</p>

<h3>Provision-specific considerations</h3>

<h4>Maintained nursery schools</h4>

<p>255.	All parts of the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> apply to maintained nursery schools and to early years provision in mainstream schools. However, as with all provision, maintained nursery schools have some specific factors that should be taken into account.</p>

<p>256.	In <a class="govuk-link" href="#maintained-nursery-schools">maintained nursery schools</a>, inspectors will always carry out at least 3 deep dives; one will be in communication and language and one other prime area of learning. At least one other deep dive will be in a specific area of learning.</p>

<p>257.	Inspectors will spend most of the inspection time gathering first-hand evidence by observing the quality of the daily routines and activities of children and staff. Inspectors will also discuss children’s development with staff. Much of this will be through incidental conversations prompted by observing the children at play and the interactions between them and adults.</p>

<p>258.	The choice of teaching methods is a decision for providers. The inspector will judge the quality of the provision in relation to the impact it has on children’s learning, development and well-being.</p>

<p>259.	We recognise that the disruption to learning caused by the pandemic may have impacted on what children have learned. This could result in some children having a wider than usual range of starting points and gaps in their knowledge. Inspectors will pay close attention to how maintained nursery schools identify and address any of these delays and gaps and what it is doing to address disruption to learning to ensure that children are well prepared for their next stage of education.  Inspectors will use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a child in the maintained nursery school, taking account of the ages of the children and whether they attend part time or full time.</p>

<p>260.	Inspectors will gather and evaluate evidence about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders identify children’s early starting points, particularly those children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which staff use the 7 areas of learning to introduce children to new ideas, vocabulary and syntax, and to develop children’s love of stories, poems, songs and rhymes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> curriculum is coherently sequenced to meet all children’s needs and starting points</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders are suitably ambitious for all children and consider their cultural capital when preparing them for the next stage in their education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders include disadvantaged children and those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> in all aspects of school life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how successfully leaders involve parents, carers and, as necessary, other professionals/specialist services in deciding how best to support children</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well children’s learning and development are shared with parents as required by the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, and the extent to which parents are supported to help their child to learn</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Junior, middle, studio schools and university technical colleges</h4>

<p>261.	There are some schools that start and stop at non-standard ages for pupils, so inspectors take into account national expectations differently.</p>

<p>262.	Pupils at junior schools, on average, have higher attainment scores at the end of key stage 2 than pupils at all other primary schools. However, on average, they also have lower progress scores. This may be for a variety of reasons, and inspectors will take this into account when comparing their results with those of pupils in schools that start education from the beginning of key stage 1.</p>

<p>263.	Pupils at middle schools, on average, have lower progress scores at the end of key stage 2 than pupils at primary schools. Due to the age range of pupils at middle schools, pupils will have only attended a middle school for a short time before they take their key stage 2 tests and will still have a number of years left at the school. Inspectors will take this into account when comparing pupils’ results to those of schools that start educating their pupils from the beginning of key stage 1.</p>

<p>264.	The government’s ambition for <abbr title="English Baccalaureate">EBacc</abbr> does not apply to <abbr title="university technical colleges">UTCs</abbr> and studio schools because they provide a specialist technical and professional education.</p>

<p>265.	The Progress 8 accountability measure is not the most appropriate performance indicator for <abbr title="university technical colleges">UTCs</abbr> and studio schools. These establishments typically start educating pupils at age 14 and have a focus on preparing pupils for their future careers. Inspectors will pay attention to other measures, particularly pupils’ destinations when they leave the <abbr title="university technical college">UTC</abbr> or studio school.</p>

<h4>Evaluating schools’ use of alternative provision</h4>

<p>266.	If pupils in <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and other alternative providers attend off-site alternative provision, inspectors will evaluate the extent to which these placements are safe and effective in promoting pupils’ progress. Inspectors will visit a sample of the alternative providers used. Inspectors will want to understand how providers ensure that pupils who attend multiple settings or part time are kept safe when they are not on site for the whole school day.</p>

<h4>Evaluating quality of education in pupil referral units and academy alternative provision</h4>

<p>267.	<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and academy alternative providers differ from other schools in that they are intended to be short-term interventions to secure the successful re-engagement into education. In these settings, inspectors will gather and evaluate evidence about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders identify, assess and meet the needs of pupils when they first begin to attend the <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> or other alternative provider, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that the curriculum is coherently sequenced and meets all pupils’ needs, starting points and aspirations for the future, including through remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how successfully leaders involve parents, carers and, as necessary, other professionals or specialist services in deciding how best to support pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders are ambitious for all pupils, and the extent to which those responsible for governance understand the particular context of the provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders include pupils in all aspects of school life, giving particular emphasis to how well they are prepared for their next steps in education, employment and training, and adult lives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well leaders ensure that pupils’ outcomes are improving as a result of any different or additional provision being made for them, including outcomes for pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>268.	Pupils in <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and other alternative providers often have significant, complex vulnerabilities. In the same way as with other schools, inspectors will evaluate the ways in which leaders have made appropriate and effective safeguarding arrangements for pupils in the light of their higher vulnerability to safeguarding risks, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will expect providers to understand their unique contextual safeguarding factors and outline how they proactively work, including with other agencies, to mitigate the specific factors that affect their pupils and the community that they serve.</p>

<p>269.	<abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and other alternative providers may have different objectives in their work related to the reasons why a pupil is placed in alternative provision, the needs of the pupil, the duration of placements and the proportion of time that pupils stay with the provider each week. For instance, in a <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> that provides short-term placements for excluded pupils or those at risk of exclusion, the core work may emphasise specific improvements in pupils’ attitudes, behaviour and/or attendance alongside their academic/vocational/technical achievement or be aiming to reintegrate pupils into mainstream schools. Alternative providers may also offer services to schools and other educational settings to help them support children with additional needs in their settings. An alternative provision setting may be the permanent destination for some pupils. Inspectors will evaluate schools’ success in these areas, while bearing in mind that we expect high academic/vocational/technical aspirations for all pupils.</p>

<p>270.	Transitions into <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> and alternative providers are often complex, involving dual registration, periods of non-attendance and meetings with a range of services and families. When evaluating pupils’ attainment and progress, inspectors will consider the ways in which leaders have identified, assessed and met the needs of pupils. They will evaluate the progress that pupils have made since they began to attend the alternative provision.</p>

<p>271.	For pupils who have left the <abbr title="pupil referral unit">PRU</abbr> or other alternative provider, inspectors will consider how well the progress they made there enabled them to move on to suitable destinations and, post-16, to take courses at an appropriately demanding level. They will also look closely at how effective liaison is with other schools to ensure that there are appropriately high expectations and, as far as reasonably possible, continuity in pupils’ education programmes. Inspectors will also look at whether the provider works closely with families, schools and other agencies to ensure a smooth transition to and from alternative provision. They will look at whether it sets expectations that reintegration back into mainstream education is a key component of a placement. Inspectors will look at whether the provider has adapted the approach to securing a good transition for every pupil in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>272.	The behaviour and attitudes judgement considers how leaders and staff create a safe, calm, orderly and positive environment in the school and the impact this has on the behaviour and attitudes of pupils.</p>

<p>273.	The judgement focuses on the factors that research and inspection evidence indicate contribute most strongly to pupils’ positive behaviour and attitudes, thereby giving them the greatest possible opportunity to achieve positive outcomes. These factors are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>having a calm and orderly environment in the school and the classroom, as this is essential for pupils to be able to learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>setting clear routines and expectations for the behaviour of pupils across all aspects of school life, not just in the classroom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having a strong focus on attendance and punctuality so that disruption is minimised</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>having clear and effective behaviour and attendance policies with clearly defined consequences that are applied consistently and fairly by all staff. Children, and particularly adolescents, often have particularly strong concepts of fairness that may be challenged by different treatment by different teachers or of different pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>developing pupils’ motivation and positive attitudes to learning, as these are important predictors of attainment. Developing positive attitudes can also have a longer-term impact on how pupils approach learning tasks in later stages of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fostering a positive and respectful school culture in which staff know and care about pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>creating an environment in which pupils feel safe, and in which bullying, discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and sexual violence – online or offline – are not accepted and are dealt with quickly, consistently and effectively whenever they occur</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>274.	Inspectors’ evidence for the importance of each of these factors comes from their inspection experience, areas of agreement in academic research and our own research. A full note of how the criteria relate to the available research can be found in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework-overview-of-research"><abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> research commentary</a>.</p>

<p>275.	Additionally, inspectors will expect schools to have effective behaviour policies in place regarding harmful sexual behaviour. The policies should include details of appropriate sanctions that should be consistently applied and that reflect and are consistent with the messages that are taught across the curriculum.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h3>

<h4>Pupils who have specific needs, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>
</h4>

<p>276.	The school may be working with pupils with particular needs in order to improve their behaviour or their attendance. When this is the case, behaviour and conduct that reflects the school’s high expectations and their consistent, fair implementation are likely to include demonstrable improvement in the attendance and behaviour of these pupils, taking account of the individual circumstances of the school.</p>

<h4>Pupils who are not in the school during the inspection</h4>

<p>277.	Inspectors will gather evidence about the typical behaviour of all the pupils who attend the school, including those who are not present on the day of inspection. If there is evidence that a school has deliberately removed pupils from the school site on the day of inspection or has arranged for them to be absent, and inspectors reasonably believe that this was done in order to have an impact on the inspection, then inspectors are likely to judge both behaviour and attitudes and leadership and management to be inadequate.</p>

<h4>Suspensions and exclusions</h4>

<p>278.	If a school uses suspensions, inspectors will evaluate their effectiveness, including the rates, patterns and reasons for suspensions and whether any pupils are repeatedly suspended. Schools should have a strategy for reintegrating a pupil who returns to school following a suspension and for managing their future behaviour. Inspectors will consider how well the school is recognising and acting to address any patterns that exist. This is because disruptive behaviour or sudden changes in behaviour can be an indication of unmet needs or a change in another aspect of a young person’s life.</p>

<p>279.	Headteachers have the right to exclude pupils when there are legitimate reasons for them to do so. Used correctly, exclusion is a vital measure for headteachers to use. Exclusions must be legal and justified. Permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, in response to a serious breach or persistent breaches of the school’s behaviour policy, and when allowing the pupil to remain in school would seriously harm the education or welfare of the pupil or others in the school.</p>

<p>280.	Inspectors will consider whether the school is developing the use of alternative strategies to exclusion and taking account of any safeguarding risks to pupils who may be excluded. Inspectors will recognise when schools are doing all that they can to support pupils at risk of exclusion, including through tenacious attempts to engage local support services.</p>

<h4>Evaluating behaviour and attitudes in pupil referral units and academy alternative provision</h4>

<p>281.	Inspectors will take the school’s official records as a starting point for discussions about attendance. They must evaluate pupils’ attendance as a percentage of a full-time timetable, even when temporary part-time arrangements are in place. Leaders may have a range of ways of evaluating pupils’ attendance, given that pupils often join and leave the school roll at various times of the year. Inspectors will take into account the turnover of pupils in the provision when considering evidence for attitudes and behaviour. Inspectors will evaluate the impact of strategies that leaders use to improve pupils’ attendance.</p>

<p>282.	Often, pupils attending <abbr title="pupil referral units">PRUs</abbr> and other alternative providers have had poor attendance in the past. Inspectors will evaluate the improvement in pupils’ attendance from their starting points when this is relevant. Inspectors will also evaluate the ways in which leaders take account of pupils’ weak attendance in their safeguarding systems and the clarity of their attendance recording. If schools use part-time timetables, and pupils are not attending other provision or placements in addition to their school, inspectors will evaluate the extent to which schools monitor these situations and are aspirational and effective in getting pupils into the education full time, quickly and in line with <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance. Part-time timetables should not be open-ended and should result in swift full-time education for the pupils.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating behaviour and attitudes on graded inspections</h3>

<p>283.	Inspectors will hold discussions with pupils and staff to gather evidence about school culture and practice in relation to pupils’ behaviour, support for staff and other systems. In setting up discussions, inspectors will select a sample of staff, as research suggests that staff are most affected by pupils’ challenging behaviour. These discussions will include trainees, supply staff, <abbr title="early career teachers">ECTs</abbr>, administrative support staff and catering staff, as well as other members of staff. The discussions will provide inspectors with valuable information that includes the views of those who most urgently require the school’s support in managing pupils’ behaviour. Where practically possible, inspectors will carry out discussions with individuals, not groups, to allow members of staff to give clear evidence without being influenced by the views or expectations of others in the group when talking about a sensitive issue.</p>

<p>284.	Inspectors will speak to pupils from a range of different backgrounds and who have different experiences of the school’s approach to behaviour. This should include pupils who have experienced sanctions under the school’s behaviour policy. Inspectors will take into account the views of these pupils, their experiences of others’ behaviour and attitudes towards them, and their understanding of the importance of positive behaviour in school and beyond school.</p>

<p>285.	Inspectors will evaluate the experience of particular individuals and groups, such as pupils for whom referrals have been made to the local authority (and check, for a small sample of these pupils, how the referral was made and the thoroughness of the follow-up), pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, children looked after, those with medical needs and those with mental health needs. In order to do this, inspectors will look at the experience of a small sample of these pupils and consider the way the school is working with the multi-agency group to ensure that the child receives the support they need. For pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>, this will include ensuring that appropriate reasonable adjustments are made in accordance with the Equality Act 2010 and the <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> code of practice.</p>

<p>286.	The pupil and staff surveys used in inspection contain questions about safeguarding, behaviour and discipline, bullying, how respondents feel about the school and how well supported and respected they feel they are in the school. Inspectors will meet school leaders to discuss the results of the interviews and surveys of pupils and staff.</p>

<p>287.	Over the course of inspection, inspectors will carry out evidence-gathering activities. In some cases, inspectors will be able to gather this evidence as part of other activities they are carrying out. The activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ behaviour in a range of different classes at different times of the day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils at breaktimes, lunchtimes, between lessons and, if they are led and managed by the school, before- and after-school clubs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ punctuality in arriving at school and at lessons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>observing pupils’ respect for, and courtesy and good manners towards, each other and adults, and their pride in themselves and their school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the school’s analysis of, and response to, pupils’ behaviour over time, in whatever format the school already has</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>analysing absence and persistent absence rates for all pupils, and for different groups compared with national averages for all pupils; this includes the extent to which low attenders are improving their attendance over time and whether attendance is consistently low</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the prevalence of permanent exclusion, the procedures surrounding this and the reasons for it, and the support given to make sure that it is a last resort</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>evaluating the effectiveness of suspensions, including the rates and reasons for exclusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>assessing the school’s work to follow up and support suspended pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering the views of parents, staff, those with responsibility for governance and other stakeholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gathering evidence about the typical behaviour of pupils who are not in school during the inspection, for example whether they have suspensions in the 2 years before inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>balancing evidence seen during the inspection and evidence of trends over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>visiting any off-site unit that the school runs (on its own or in partnership with other schools) for pupils whose behaviour is poor or who have low attendance. Inspectors will assess safeguarding procedures, the quality of education and how effectively the unit helps to improve pupils’ behaviour, learning and attendance. For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Alternative-provision">‘Evaluating school’s use of alternative provision on graded inspections’ section</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>288.	Inspectors will recognise that the context in which schools operate has changed as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, they will consider the specific context and the steps school leaders have taken to ensure the best possible rates of attendance since the school opened to all pupils in March 2021. Attendance between March 2020 and March 2021 will not impact on inspector’s judgement of the school.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating behaviour and attitudes on ungraded inspections</h3>

<p>289.	In evaluating behaviour and attitudes for ungraded inspections, inspectors may consider any of the factors set out in the grade descriptors for graded inspections. However, they will usually focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the school has high expectations for pupils’ behaviour and conduct and applies these expectations consistently and fairly. Inspectors will also consider whether this is reflected in pupils’ positive behaviour and conduct. They will consider whether staff make sure that pupils follow appropriate routines, whether low-level disruption is not tolerated and whether pupils’ behaviour does not disrupt lessons or the day-to-day life of the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders, staff and pupils create a positive environment in which bullying is not tolerated. If bullying, aggression, discrimination and derogatory language occur, they are dealt with quickly and effectively and are not allowed to spread</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour not being managed well as potential evidence that the school would no longer receive at least its current grade if a graded inspection was carried out. If the lead inspector has serious concerns about behaviour, the inspection will be deemed to be a graded inspection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>290.	Inspectors will gather this evidence principally through the deep dives carried out. They may carry out additional inspection activity (such as that set in the paragraph above) where they consider it necessary.</p>

<h2>Evaluating personal development</h2>

<p>291.	The curriculum provided by schools should extend beyond the academic, technical or vocational. Schools support pupils to develop in many diverse aspects of life. The personal development judgement is used by inspectors to evaluate the school’s intent to provide for the personal development of all pupils, and the quality with which the school implements this work. Inspectors will recognise that the impact of the school’s provision for personal development will often not be assessable during pupils’ time at school.</p>

<p>292.	At the same time as the school is working with pupils, those pupils are also being influenced by other factors in their home environment, their community and elsewhere. Schools can teach pupils how to build their confidence and resilience, for example, but they cannot always determine how well young people draw on this. Schools are crucial in preparing pupils for their adult lives, teaching them to understand how to engage with society and providing them with plentiful opportunities to do so. In this judgement, therefore, inspectors will seek to evaluate the quality and intent of what a school provides (either directly or by drawing on high-quality agencies and providers, for example the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme, Cadet Forces and the National Citizenship Service), but will not attempt to measure the impact of the school’s work on the lives of individual pupils.</p>

<p>293.	This judgement focuses on the factors that research and inspection evidence indicate contribute most strongly to pupils’ personal development. These include how the school:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensures that curriculum subjects such as citizenship, <abbr title="religious education">RE</abbr> and other areas such as personal, social, health and economic education, and relationships and sex education, contribute to pupils’ personal development – including by considering the provision, quality and take-up of extra-curricular activities offered by the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils to become responsible, respectful and active citizens who are able to play their part and become actively involved in public life as adults</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>through the curriculum, assemblies, wider opportunities, visits, discussions and literature, develops and deepens pupils’ understanding of the fundamental British values of democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law, and mutual respect and tolerance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>promotes equality of opportunity so that all pupils can thrive together, understanding that difference is a positive, not a negative, and that individual characteristics make people unique. This includes, but is not limited to, pupils’ understanding of the protected characteristics and how equality and diversity are promoted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensures an inclusive environment that meets the needs of all pupils, irrespective of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation, and where no discrimination exists, for example in respect of wider opportunities for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ characters, which we define as a set of positive personal traits, dispositions and virtues that informs pupils’ motivation and guides their conduct so that they reflect wisely, learn eagerly, behave with integrity and cooperate consistently well with others. This gives pupils the qualities they need to flourish in our society</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ confidence, resilience and knowledge so that they can keep themselves mentally healthy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enables pupils to recognise online and offline risks to their well-being – for example, risks from criminal and sexual exploitation, domestic abuse, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, substance misuse, gang activity, radicalisation and extremism – and making them aware of the support available to them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>enables pupils to recognise the dangers of inappropriate use of mobile technology and social media</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ understanding of how to keep physically healthy, eat healthily and maintain an active lifestyle, including giving ample opportunities for pupils to be active during the school day and through extra-curricular activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develops pupils’ age-appropriate understanding of healthy relationships through appropriate relationships and sex education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>supports readiness for the next phase of education, training or employment so that pupils are equipped to make the transition successfully, including, for secondary schools, through careers information education, advice and guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in special schools, enriches the curriculum, taking into account specific factors such as the local area’s arrangements for providing home-to-school transport for children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>294.	We will expect the school’s relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) curriculum (and wider curriculum) to specifically address sexual harassment, online abuse and sexual violence. The curriculum should also address safeguarding risks (including online risks), issues of consent, and what constitutes a healthy relationship both online and offline. We will also expect schools to provide effective pastoral support. This includes being alert to factors that increase a child’s vulnerability, or potential vulnerability, such as mental ill health, domestic abuse, having additional needs, and being at greater risk of exploitation and/or of feeling unable to report abuse (for example, girls and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children).</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating personal development</h3>

<p>295.	Where usual opportunities have been disrupted by the pandemic, inspectors will look at whether the school has found alternative approaches to providing a rich range of personal development opportunities since the school reopened to all pupils in March 2021.</p>

<h3>Relationships, sex and health education on graded inspections</h3>

<p>296.	Relationships education is compulsory for all primary school pupils and relationships and sex education is compulsory for all secondary school pupils.  Health education is also compulsory for pupils in state-funded schools only.</p>

<p>297.	If a school is failing to meet its obligations, inspectors will consider this when reaching the personal development and leadership and management judgements.</p>

<p>298.	See the guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools">‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics’</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development</h3>

<p>299.	Inspectors will evaluate the effectiveness of the school’s provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural education. This is a broad concept that can be seen across the school’s activities, but draws together many of the areas covered by the personal development judgement.</p>

<p>300.	Provision for the spiritual development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ability to be reflective about their own beliefs (religious or otherwise) and perspective on life</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of, and respect for, different people’s faiths, feelings and values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sense of enjoyment and fascination in learning about themselves, others and the world around them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>use of imagination and creativity in their learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to reflect on their experiences</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>301.	Provision for the moral development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ability to recognise the difference between right and wrong and to readily apply this understanding in their own lives, and to recognise legal boundaries and, in doing so, respect the civil and criminal law of England</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understanding of the consequences of their behaviour and actions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interest in investigating and offering reasoned views about moral and ethical issues and ability to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others on these issues</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>302.	Provision for the social development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>use of a range of social skills in different contexts, for example working and socialising with other pupils, including those from different religious, ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to participate in a variety of communities and social settings, including by volunteering, cooperating well with others and being able to resolve conflicts effectively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>acceptance of and engagement with the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. They will develop and demonstrate skills and attitudes that will allow them to participate fully in and contribute positively to life in modern Britain</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>303.	Provision for the cultural development of pupils includes developing their:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>understanding and appreciation of the wide range of cultural influences that have shaped their own heritage and that of others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>understanding and appreciation of the range of different cultures in the school and further afield as an essential element of their preparation for life in modern Britain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ability to recognise, and value, the things we share in common across cultural, religious, ethnic and socio-economic communities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>knowledge of Britain’s democratic Parliamentary system and its central role in shaping our history and values, and in continuing to develop Britain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>willingness to participate in and respond positively to artistic, musical, sporting and cultural opportunities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interest in exploring, improving understanding of and showing respect for different faiths and cultural diversity and the extent to which they understand, accept, respect and celebrate diversity. This is shown by their respect and attitudes towards different religious, ethnic and socio-economic groups in the local, national and global communities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating personal development on graded inspections</h3>

<p>304.	On graded inspections, inspectors will focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the school has had due regard to the statutory guidance on RHSE (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#RSE">‘Relationships, sex and health education on graded inspections’ section</a>) and so:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>has formed a policy following consultation with parents</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has staff trained to assess and deliver the RHSE curriculum</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>appropriately supports children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> to learn RHSE</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether pupils have sufficient age-appropriate awareness and understanding of the protected characteristics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether pupils have sufficient knowledge about how to stay safe, including online</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, citizenship education, modern British values, the development of character and wider development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in secondary schools, the effectiveness of <abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>305.	Much of the evidence that inspectors will consider in making the personal development judgement will be drawn from across the deep dives carried out, and conversations with leaders, staff, pupils and governors. Inspectors will also draw on any other evidence they consider as part of the inspection.</p>

<h4>Careers provision on graded inspections</h4>

<p>306.	All secondary schools are expected to provide effective <abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr>, in line with the statutory <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/careers-guidance-provision-for-young-people-in-schools">‘Careers guidance and access for education and training providers’</a>, to encourage pupils to make good choices and understand what they need to do to succeed in the careers to which they aspire.</p>

<p>307.	As part of this, it is important that schools understand and meet the requirements of section 42B of the Education Act 1997 (referred to in <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance as ‘provider access legislation’), which came into force in January 2018. Both maintained schools and academies are required by law to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>provide opportunities for a range of education and training providers to speak to pupils in Years 8 to 13 to inform them about technical education qualifications and apprenticeships</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>publish a policy statement setting out the arrangements the school has in place for pupils to access education and training providers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make sure the policy statement is followed so that all pupils in Years 8 to 13 receive information about the full range of education and training options</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>308.	In assessing a secondary school’s personal development offer, inspectors will assess the quality of careers provision and how well it benefits pupils in choosing and deciding on their next steps. This will include looking at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of the unbiased careers advice and guidance provided to pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s implementation of the provider access arrangements to enable a range of education and training providers to speak to pupils in Years 8 to 13</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how the school provides good-quality, meaningful opportunities for pupils to encounter the world of work</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gatsby.org.uk/education/focus-areas/good-career-guidance" rel="external">Gatsby Benchmarks</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the school’s published information about its careers provision (as required by the School Information Regulations) and the school’s statement on its provider access arrangements (as required by section 42B of the Education Act 1997)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>309.	If a school is not meeting the requirements of section 42B of the Education Act 1997, inspectors will state this in the inspection report. They will consider what impact this has on the quality of careers provision and the subsequent judgement for personal development.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating personal development on ungraded inspections</h3>

<p>310.	In evaluating personal development for ungraded inspections, inspectors may consider any of the factors set out in the grade descriptors for graded inspections. However, they will focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which the curriculum goes beyond the academic, vocational or technical</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the school provides effectively for pupils’ broader development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the school’s work to enhance pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is of a high quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secondary schools’ approaches to <abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to harmful sexual behaviour on ungraded inspections</h4>

<p>311.	Inspectors will expect schools to assume that sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence are happening in and around the school, even when there are no specific reports. They will expect schools to work to prevent sexual harassment, online sexual abuse and sexual violence through a whole-school approach that includes an effective behaviour policy with appropriate sanctions, pastoral support and a carefully planned RSHE curriculum that includes addressing issues of consent.</p>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to careers provision on ungraded inspections</h4>

<p>312.	Inspectors will review and assess secondary schools’ approaches to <abbr title="careers information, education, advice and guidance">CIEAG</abbr>. If a school is not meeting its requirements in respect of career’s advice, inspectors will state this in the inspection report.</p>

<h2>Evaluating leadership and management</h2>

<p>313.	The leadership and management judgement is about how leaders, managers and those responsible for governance ensure that the education that the school provides has a positive impact on all its pupils. It focuses on the areas where inspection and research indicate that leaders and managers can have the strongest effect on the quality of the education provided by the school. Important factors include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders’ high expectations of all pupils in the school, and the extent to which these are embodied in leaders’ and staff’s day-to-day interactions with pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders focus their attention on the education provided by the school. There are many demands on leaders, but a greater focus on this area is associated with better outcomes for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether continuing professional development for teachers and staff is aligned with the curriculum, and the extent to which this develops teachers’ content knowledge and teaching content knowledge over time, so that they are able to deliver better teaching for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders create coherence and consistency across the school so that pupils benefit from effective teaching and consistent expectations, wherever they are in the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders seek to engage parents and their community thoughtfully and positively in a way that supports pupils’ education. Also, whether leaders are thoughtful in drawing boundaries and resisting inappropriate attempts to influence what is taught and the day-to-day life of the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders take into account the workload and well-being of their staff, while also developing and strengthening the quality of the workforce</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders’ and managers’ high ambitions are for all pupils, including those who are harder to reach. This includes ensuring that practices such as ‘off-rolling’ do not take place and that the way the school uses the pupil premium is founded on good evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders and those responsible for governance all understand their respective roles and perform these in a way that enhances the effectiveness of the school</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>314.	Our evidence for the importance of each of these factors comes from our inspection experience, areas of consensus in academic research and our own research. There is a full note of how the criteria relate to the evidence available in our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/education-inspection-framework-overview-of-research"><abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> research commentary</a>.</p>

<p>315.	<a class="govuk-link" href="#safeguarding">The ‘safeguarding’ section</a> sets out the importance of safeguarding and its place on inspection.</p>

<h3>Different levels of leadership</h3>

<h4>Leadership and management in a school</h4>

<p>316.	Inspectors will look at the work of headteachers, senior leaders, subject leaders and others with leadership and management roles when reaching this judgement.</p>

<h4>Leadership and management in multi-academy trusts</h4>

<p>317.	When a school is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, it is important for inspectors to remember that the trust is one entity, and that leaders and managers of the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> are responsible for the quality of education provided in all the schools that make up the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>318.	It is highly likely that parts of some of the leadership functions described in the grade criteria are performed by <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> leaders (for example, the CEO or an education director) and not solely by individual leaders of the school. School leaders are responsible for giving inspectors accurate and appropriate information about those roles and responsibilities. If leadership functions are performed by <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> leaders, then inspectors will consider whether they need to meet <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> leaders to gather evidence.</p>

<p>319.	A <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> CEO or their delegate may request to meet inspectors as a part of the inspection. They may also request to attend key inspection team meetings at the end of each inspection day. These are appropriate requests and should be accommodated. These individuals, however, should abide by the same <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conduct-during-ofsted-inspections">code of conduct</a> as all others involved in the inspection.</p>

<h4>Governance</h4>

<p>320.	Inspectors will seek evidence of the impact of those responsible for governance.</p>

<p>321.	In a maintained school, those responsible for governance are the school governors. In a stand-alone academy, it is the trustees.</p>

<p>322.	In a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, the trustees are responsible for governance. Inspectors will ask to speak to one or more of the trustees. It may be that, on occasion, the trustees have chosen to delegate some of their powers to the members of the ‘academy committee’ or ‘local governing board’ at school level. If inspectors are informed that a local governing body has delegated responsibilities, they should establish clearly which powers are with the trustees, which are with the leaders of the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> and which are with the local governing board. They should then ensure that both their inspection activities and the inspection report reflect this.</p>

<p>323.	All <abbr title="multi-academy trusts">MATs</abbr> should have, and publish, a scheme of delegation clearly setting out everything that has been delegated by the board of trustees to the local governing board or any other person or body. Advice on how this should work can be found in the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/multi-academy-trusts-establishing-and-developing-your-trust">‘Multi-academy trusts: establishing and developing your trust’</a>.</p>

<p>324.	When inspecting academies that are part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, inspectors will need to bear in mind that governance functions can be quite different from those in a maintained school. Some functions that a governing body in a maintained school would carry out may be done by management or executive staff in a trust. If this is the case, it will still be important for inspectors to ascertain the trust board’s role in that process and how it ensures that these functions are carried out properly.</p>

<p>325.	The <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/governance-handbook">governance handbook</a> sets out the purpose of governance, which is to provide confident, strategic leadership and to create robust accountability, oversight and assurance for educational and financial performance.</p>

<p>326.	The governance handbook also sets out the statutory functions of all boards, no matter what type of school or how many schools they govern. There are 3 core functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>holding executive leaders to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils, and the performance management of staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>overseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure that its money is well spent, including the pupil premium</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>327.	Inspectors will explore how governors carry out each of these functions. For example, the clarity of the school’s vision, ethos and strategic direction will have a significant impact on the decisions that leaders make about the curriculum. Inspectors will consider whether the work of governors in this respect is supporting the school to provide a high-quality education for its pupils.</p>

<p>328.	In addition, those with governance/oversight are responsible for ensuring that the school fulfils its statutory duties, for example under the Equality Act 2010, and other duties, for example in relation to the ‘Prevent’ duty and safeguarding. Governors are also expected to exercise strategic oversight of all aspects of safeguarding. When inspectors consider whether governors are fulfilling this responsibility, they are not expected to construct or review a list of duties.</p>

<h3>Specific considerations for evaluating leadership and management</h3>

<h4>The use of the pupil premium and catch-up funding</h4>

<p>329.	Inspectors will gather evidence about the use of the pupil premium and catch-up funding (and, where applicable, early years pupil premium), particularly regarding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the level of funding received by the school in the current academic year and levels of pupil premium funding received in previous academic years</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how leaders and governors have spent the funding, their rationale for this spending and its intended impact on the learning and progress of disadvantaged pupils</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>External support</h4>

<p>330.	If the school has received support from an external body, inspectors will not evaluate or report on the quality or the impact of the support and challenge on improvement in the school. Instead, they will comment on the action that the school has taken and the impact that this has had on the quality of the school’s work.</p>

<p>331.	If a school is part of a <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> and is receiving support from within the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr>, inspectors will be clear that this is internal, not external, support.</p>

<h4>Separation by sex</h4>

<p>332.	It is unlawful for schools to separate pupils on the basis of any protected characteristic such as sex, race, or religion or belief while at school, unless permitted by an exception under the Equality Act 2010, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>positive action to alleviate a disadvantage associated with a certain characteristic. This could, for example, include pupils of one race or sex getting additional work experience in a sector in which they are under-represented, or separating the pupils by sex for teaching in subjects if the school has evidence that that this improves their academic outcomes (section 158)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>competitive sport, games or other competitive activities in which physical strength, stamina or physique are significant factors in determining success or failure. A school is allowed to organise separate events for boys and girls (section 195)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>333.	If an inspector believes that a school may be separating pupils unlawfully, they will contact the duty desk. If unlawful discrimination is taking place, inspectors will write about this clearly in the inspection report. The separation may have an impact on the schools grade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a school is unlikely to be judged as good or outstanding in leadership and management if it is separating pupils unlawfully</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the school has genuine and imminent plans to reintegrate pupils, a judgement of requires improvement will normally be appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in other cases, the grade will likely be inadequate for leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>334.	Where appropriate, inspectors will also refer to the following guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools">‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics in schools’</a></p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics</h4>

<p>335.	How a school meets the expectations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education"><abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance on relationships education, relationships and sex education and health education</a> contributes to the leadership and management judgement. If a primary school does not teach about lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships, this will not have an impact on the leadership and management judgement as long as the school can satisfy inspectors that it has still fulfilled the requirements of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance. If it cannot do this, for example if it has failed to consult with parents, inspectors will consider this when making the leadership and management judgement. In those circumstances, the school will not ordinarily receive a judgement for this better than requires improvement.</p>

<p>336.	If a secondary school does not teach about lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships, it will not be meeting the expectations of the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s statutory guidance. Inspectors will consider this when making the leadership and management judgement. In those circumstances, the school will not ordinarily receive a judgement for this better than requires improvement.</p>

<p>337.	See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools/inspecting-teaching-of-the-protected-characteristics-in-schools">‘Inspecting teaching of the protected characteristics’</a> for further guidance.</p>

<h4>Workload</h4>

<p>338.	When used effectively, assessment helps pupils to embed knowledge and use it fluently, and assists teachers in producing clear next steps for pupils. However, assessment is too often carried out in a way that creates unnecessary burdens for staff and pupils. It is therefore important that leaders and teachers understand its limitations and avoid misuse and overuse.</p>

<p>339.	Assessment should support the teaching of the curriculum, but not substantially increase teachers’ workloads by necessitating too much one-to-one teaching or overly demanding programmes that are almost impossible to deliver without lowering expectations of some pupils.</p>

<p>340.	Collecting data can also create an additional workload for leaders and staff. Inspectors will look at whether schools’ collections of attainment or progress data are proportionate, represent an efficient use of school resources, and are sustainable for staff. The Teacher Workload Advisory Group’s report, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-workload-advisory-group-report-and-government-response">‘Making data work’</a>, recommends that school leaders should not have more than 2 or 3 data collection points a year, and that these should be used to inform clear actions.</p>

<p>341.	Schools choosing to use more than 2 or 3 data collection points a year should have clear reasoning for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what interpretations and actions are informed by the frequency of collection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time taken to set assessments, collate, analyse and interpret the data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the time taken to then act on the findings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>342.	We understand that assessment arrangements may have been altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will seek to understand how staff are supported and the steps that are being taken to remove the risk of additional workload. If a school’s system for data collection is disproportionate, inefficient or unsustainable for staff, inspectors will reflect this in the inspection report.</p>

<h3>Safeguarding</h3>

<p>343.	All schools should have a culture of safeguarding. This means they should have effective arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>always act in the best interests of children, pupils and students to protect them online and offline, including when they are receiving remote education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify children, pupils and students who may need early help, and who are at risk of harm or have been harmed. This can include, but is not limited to, neglect, abuse (including by their peers), grooming or exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secure the help that children, pupils and students need and, if required, refer in a timely way to those who have the expertise to help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manage safe recruitment and allegations about adults who may be a risk to children, pupils, students and vulnerable adults</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>344.	Inspectors will not grade this aspect of a school’s work. However, inspectors will always make a written judgement under ‘leadership and management’ in the report about whether the arrangements for safeguarding children and pupils are effective.</p>

<p>345.	Inspectors will go beyond ensuring that schools meet statutory requirements, and beyond simply reviewing documents, to evaluate the safeguarding culture that has been established in the school.</p>

<p>346.	Inspectors will also ensure that proper arrangements are in place to share information appropriately with relevant parties, including forwarding information to schools and post-16 or post-18 providers.</p>

<p>347.	As well as understanding Ofsted’s policies on inspecting safeguarding, inspectors will be familiar with relevant guidance on safeguarding, including statutory guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education: statutory guidance for schools and colleges’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2">‘Working together to safeguard children’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-environments-where-children-can-flourish">‘Positive environments where children can flourish’</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>348.	On all inspections, inspectors will determine whether there have been any safeguarding incidents or allegations since the last inspection, and whether the school has taken <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">appropriate action</a> to safeguard the children affected and/or to deal with allegations.</p>

<p>349.	On a very small number of occasions, inspectors come across evidence or allegations of child abuse during an inspection. Inspectors must not attempt to investigate any incident of child abuse but will satisfy themselves that concerns about a child’s safety are referred, as appropriate, to the relevant local authority’s children’s services department. The referral will normally be made by the safeguarding lead for the school (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-concerns-guidance-for-inspectors">‘Safeguarding concerns: guidance for inspectors’</a>). Inspectors must be satisfied that the correct referral has taken place and record this in their evidence base</p>

<p>350.	If a child discloses to an inspector that they are suffering or at risk of abuse, the inspector will stop all other activity and focus on ensuring that the child receives the help they need. Specific guidance on what to do in this situation can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-concerns-guidance-for-inspectors">‘Safeguarding concerns: guidance for inspectors’</a>.</p>

<p>351.	The guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a> explains how incidents will be covered in the inspection report.</p>

<p>352.	Safeguarding is ineffective when there are serious or widespread failures in the school’s or setting’s safeguarding arrangements that give cause for concern because children are not protected and statutory requirements are not being met, or because insufficient action is being taken to remedy weaknesses following a serious failure of safeguarding arrangements.</p>

<p>353.	The following are examples of what ineffective safeguarding might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>safeguarding allegations about staff members are not being handled appropriately</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children, pupils and students or particular groups of children, pupils and students do not feel safe in school or the setting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children, pupils and students have little confidence that the school or setting will address concerns about their safety, including risk of abuse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for schools, pupils are frequently missing from school (including for part of the school day), but this is not addressed appropriately by staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incidents of bullying or prejudiced and discriminatory behaviour are common</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>354.	The school must provide opportunities for inspectors to speak to pupils with no other adults present, as it is important that pupils are able to express their views freely to inspectors. This is set out in our guidance <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspectors-talking-to-pupils-on-inspection">‘Inspectors talking to pupils on inspection’</a>.</p>

<p>355.	If inspectors cannot corroborate the evidence that they gather about the effectiveness of the school’s arrangements to safeguard pupils, by talking to pupils on inspection, then safeguarding will likely be judged ineffective.</p>

<h4>Allegations of sexual harassment, abuse or violence</h4>

<p>356.	Inspectors will not investigate allegations of sexual harassment, abuse or violence, but will ensure that allegations are reported to the appropriate authority.</p>

<p>357.	As set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">‘Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills settings’</a>, inspectors will consider how schools handle allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and violence, including that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>staff have appropriate knowledge of part 5 of the government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">‘Keeping children safe in education’ guidance</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff also have good awareness of the signs that a child is being neglected or abused, as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-if-youre-worried-a-child-is-being-abused--2">‘What to do if you’re worried a child is being abused’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all pupils are supported to report concerns about harmful sexual behaviour, and barriers that could prevent a pupil from making a disclosure, for example communication needs, are identified and addressed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff are confident and well trained in handling reports of sexual harassment, abuse or violence in line with the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr>’s guidance, including incidents between children, and those off school premises</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>all allegations are taken seriously, comprehensively recorded and dealt with swiftly and appropriately, and pupils are confident that this is the case</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>358.	If schools do not have adequate processes in place, it is likely that safeguarding will be considered ineffective.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating leadership and management on graded inspections</h3>

<p>359.	Evidence used to evaluate the impact of leaders’ work, both currently and over time, includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meetings with leaders, including <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> senior staff if appropriate, to discuss how well they know the school and the quality of education that it provides for pupils</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meetings with those responsible for governance, as appropriate, to evaluate how well they fulfil their statutory duties, including their duties under the Equality Act 2010 and in relation to safeguarding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documentary evidence provided by the school that demonstrates the effectiveness of the school’s provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>interviews with staff and pupils to evidence how well leaders have created a positive culture</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>first-hand evidence gathered during the course of inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responses to the staff and pupil questionnaires and Ofsted Parent View; these will be particularly useful for evaluating the culture that has been established in the school by leaders and managers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any evidence the school has from regularly surveying its staff and the way in which leaders and managers have responded to concerns raised by staff or parents, for example about how senior leaders support teachers to tackle low-level disruptive behaviour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if there are unusual patterns of pupil movement, discussions with school leaders, the local authority and (where appropriate) the <abbr title="multi-academy trust">MAT</abbr> about those movements</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>360.	Inspectors will always report on the school’s activity to gather the views of staff, whether through its internal procedures or through using the Ofsted questionnaire. They will do this in the <a class="govuk-link" href="link">‘Information about this inspection’ section</a>.</p>

<h4>Evaluating schools’ use of alternative provision on graded inspections</h4>

<p>361.	Inspectors will evaluate how well a school continues to take responsibility for its pupils who attend alternative or off-site provision. Inspectors need to be assured that leaders have ensured that the alternative provision is a suitable and safe placement that will meet pupils’ academic/vocational/technical needs, pastoral needs and, if appropriate, <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr> needs. Inspectors will speak to a selection of pupils who attend off-site provision, where possible, including potentially through video or telephone calls.</p>

<p>362.	Inspectors will ask the school about the registration status of any alternative providers that they use. Any provider of alternative provision must be registered as an independent school if it caters full time for 5 or more pupils of compulsory school age, or one pupil who is looked after or has an education, health and care (<abbr title="education, health and care">EHC</abbr>) plan. If a school uses alternative provision that should be registered but is not, inspectors will carefully consider whether this affects the likelihood that pupils are safeguarded effectively.</p>

<p>363.	Inspectors will normally visit a sample of any part-time unregistered alternative providers during the inspection, as directed by the relevant Ofsted region. This may be completed remotely. This is to assess the adequacy of the school’s quality assurance process. Inspectors will visit any registered alternative provision site that we have not yet inspected to assess the adequacy of the school’s quality assurance process.</p>

<p>364.	Inspectors will consider the quality of registered alternative provision using our latest inspection report and assess its impact on the overall quality of education for pupils in a proportionate way.</p>

<p>365.	Inspectors will consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the reasons why leaders considered off-site provision to be the best option for the pupils concerned, and whether leaders have kept that under review</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether leaders have made the appropriate checks on the registration status of the provision and how that has influenced their decision to use that provider</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>what safeguarding checks leaders have made and continue to make to ensure that the provision is a safe place for their pupils to attend</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders ensure that pupils benefit from a well-planned and sequenced, well-taught, broad and balanced curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the attendance and behaviour of the pupils who attend the provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how well the provision promotes pupils’ personal development</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>366.	If a school uses a provider that is not registered, the inspector must contact the duty desk so that staff can notify Ofsted’s unregistered schools team. Following the inspection, the team will determine whether Ofsted needs to take further action because there is reasonable cause to believe that the setting is operating as an unregistered school.</p>

<p>367.	A school is likely to be judged inadequate for leadership and management if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is making ineffective or inappropriate use of alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it is using inappropriate alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders have not taken the necessary steps to assure themselves of the suitability of a provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders are not aware of how many of their pupils attend alternative provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leaders are not taking responsibility for their pupils who attend alternative provision</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluating gaming on a graded inspection</h4>

<p>368.	Inspectors will challenge leaders and managers about unusual patterns of examination entry that appear to ‘game the system’, for example if they are entering pupils for courses that are not in their educational best interest. The <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr> will provide inspectors with areas to investigate when nationally available data suggests that gaming may be taking place. If inspectors uncover evidence that deliberate gaming is taking place, the leadership and management judgement is likely to be inadequate.</p>

<p>369.	Inspectors will also challenge leaders and managers about unusual patterns in the way that the school records attendance, including the use of inaccurate register codes or changes to when the register is taken. For example, if inspectors reasonably believe that a school is inaccurately recording attendance, has changed the timing of session registration to game attendance rates or is using part-time timetables inappropriately, then inspectors are likely to judge leadership and management to be inadequate.</p>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to inclusion and off-rolling on a graded inspection</h4>

<p>370.	Schools should have an inclusive culture that supports arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>identify early those pupils who may be disadvantaged or have additional needs or barriers to learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet the needs of those pupils, drawing on more specialist support when necessary, and help those pupils to engage positively with the curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure that pupils have a positive experience of learning and achieve positive outcomes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ensure, during the pandemic, that pupils are returned to school as soon as is appropriate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>371.	There is no legal definition of ‘off-rolling’. However, we define ‘off-rolling’ as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">The practice of removing a pupil from the school roll without a formal, permanent exclusion or by encouraging a parent to remove their child from the school roll, when the removal is primarily in the interests of the school rather than in the best interests of the pupil. Off-rolling in these circumstances is a form of <a class="govuk-link" href="#gaming">gaming</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>372.	When inspectors find evidence of off-rolling taking place by Ofsted’s definition, they will always address this in the inspection report. They may, depending on the scale and impact, need to consider it when reaching the judgement. Where a decision is lawful, but still meets Ofsted’s definition of off-rolling, inspectors will be careful to consider the context of the decision and the integrity of leaders’ actions. They should be clear about what impact the off-rolling has had on pupils involved, and on the school. There are many different activities that can constitute off-rolling, so there can be no hard and fast rules as to how it should be addressed. However, if inspectors determine the school to be off-rolling according to Ofsted’s definition, then the leadership and management of the school are likely to be judged inadequate.</p>

<p>373.	There are reasons why a school might remove a pupil from the school roll, such as when a pupil moves house or a parent decides, without encouragement or coercion by the school, to home educate their child. This is not off-rolling. If the pupil transfers to the roll of their alternative provision, and this is genuinely in the best interest of the pupil, this is not off-rolling. If a school appropriately removes a pupil from the roll due to a formal permanent exclusion and follows the proper processes, this is not off-rolling. Headteachers have the right to exclude pupils when there are legitimate reasons for them to do so. Used correctly, exclusion is a vital measure for headteachers to use.</p>

<p>374.	Dual-registering or dual-coding a pupil in 2 schools or providers, or using alternative provision while they remain registered at the school, is not off-rolling because the pupil has not left the roll of their school. However, this may still be a form of gaming if it is not in the best interests of the pupil. Managed moves can be an effective tool in breaking a cycle of poor behaviour, but they can also be a form of off-rolling. Managed moves are not off-rolling only when they are genuinely used in a pupil’s best interests, within the statutory guidance. If a school uses managed moves, inspectors may ask to see evidence of the ways in which these have been carried out.</p>

<p>375.	Inspectors will be interested if there are high numbers of pupils moving on and off roll, but this may not in itself mean that off-rolling is taking place.</p>

<h3>The impact of safeguarding on the leadership and management judgement on graded inspections</h3>

<p>376.	When safeguarding is ineffective, this is likely to lead to a judgement of inadequate for leadership and management. However, there may be circumstances when it is appropriate to judge a setting as requires improvement, rather than inadequate, if there are minor weaknesses in safeguarding arrangements that are easy to put right and do not leave children either being harmed or at risk of harm.</p>

<h3>Ofsted’s approach to evaluating leadership and management on ungraded inspections</h3>

<p>377.	In evaluating leadership and management for ungraded inspections, inspectors may consider any of the factors set out in the grade descriptors for graded inspections; however, they will focus on the matters set out below. In addition, inspectors will consider the extent to which those responsible for governance understand their role and carry this out effectively.</p>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to safeguarding on an ungraded inspection</h4>

<p>378.	Inspectors will always consider the effectiveness of the school’s safeguarding. All schools should have a good culture of safeguarding. This means that they should have effective arrangements to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>always act in the best interests of pupils to protect them online and offline</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify pupils who may need early help or who are at risk of neglect, abuse, grooming or exploitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>secure the help that pupils need, and, if required, refer pupils in a timely way to those who have the expertise to help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>manage safe recruitment and allegations about adults who may be a risk to children, pupils, students and vulnerable adults</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>379.	Inspectors will usually carry out the following activities during the inspection to inform their safeguarding judgement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>check the school’s single central record, focusing on staff that have joined since the school’s last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review the school’s safeguarding training schedule or record, focusing on new staff that have joined since the last inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>review safeguarding records or case files and Parent View responses for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask (in an age-appropriate way) several pupils if they know how to raise safeguarding concerns</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ask a selection of staff, including non-teaching staff and new staff, if they know how to raise safeguarding concerns</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>380.	Inspectors will not grade this key aspect of a school’s work. However, inspectors will always make a written judgement in the report about whether the arrangements for safeguarding children and pupils are effective. Inspectors will go beyond simply reviewing documents in order to evaluate the safeguarding culture of the school.</p>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to gaming and off-rolling on an ungraded inspection</h4>

<p>381.	Inspectors will look for any evidence that suggests that the school may be gaming or off-rolling, which could be evidence that the school would no longer receive at least its current grade if a graded inspection were carried out. Where the lead inspector has serious concerns about gaming or off-rolling, the inspection will be deemed to be a graded inspection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gaming – entering or not entering pupils for courses or qualifications that are not in their educational best interests in order to achieve apparently better performance for the school</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>off-rolling – removing, or encouraging the removal of, a pupil or pupils from the school roll without a formal, permanent exclusion when the removal is primarily in the interests of the school rather than in the best interests of the pupil</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Evaluating a school’s approach to staff workload on an ungraded inspection</h4>

<p>382.	Inspectors will look at the extent to which leaders engage with staff and are aware and take account of the main pressures on them, engaging with them realistically and constructively.</p>

<p>383.	Inspectors will consider the extent to which staff are free from bullying and harassment. Inspectors will also consider whether leaders and staff understand the limitations of assessment and use it in a way that will avoid creating unnecessary burdens.</p>

<p>384.	We understand that assessment arrangements may have been altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inspectors will seek to understand how staff are supported and the steps that are being taken to remove the risk of additional workload.</p>

<p>385.	If these issues are not being managed well, this could be considered as evidence that the school would no longer receive at least its current grade if a graded inspection were carried out. Where the lead inspector has serious concerns about workload or the bullying or harassment of staff, the inspection will be deemed to be a graded inspection.</p>

<h2>Evaluating early years and sixth-form provision on graded inspections</h2>

<h3>Early years provision in schools</h3>

<p>386.	Inspectors are required to grade the standards of education and care in any early years provision in schools and to write about its effectiveness in the inspection report. Inspectors’ judgement on the effectiveness of early years provision will include evaluation of the provision for 2- and 3-year-olds. Inspectors will also note if any children receive additional funding.</p>

<p>387.	We recognise that the disruption to learning caused by the pandemic may have impacted on what children have learned. This could result in some children having a wider than usual range of starting points and gaps in their knowledge. Inspectors will pay close attention to how schools identify and address any of these delays and gaps and what the school is doing to address disruption to learning to ensure that children are well prepared for their next stage of education.  Inspectors will use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a child in the early years provision, taking account of the ages of the children and whether they attend part time or full time.</p>

<p>388.	The effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding children is reflected in the main judgement for the school.</p>

<p>389.	Inspectors will take account of all the judgements made across the evaluation schedule. In particular, they should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders and staff plan, design and implement the early years curriculum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which the curriculum and care practices meet the needs of the range of children who attend, particularly any children with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the progress all children make in their learning and development relative to their starting points and their readiness for the next stage of their education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children’s personal, social and emotional development, including whether they feel safe and are secure, stimulated and happy</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>390.	Inspectors will particularly consider the intent, implementation and impact of the school’s early years curriculum. They will evaluate the impact that the quality of education has on children, particularly the most disadvantaged and those with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<p>391.	Inspectors will look at children’s learning and development over time. They will ascertain how well the curriculum is meeting children’s needs. This will be evident in the extent to which children know and remember more of the intended curriculum. Inspectors need to make careful inferences about children’s current progress by drawing together evidence from a range of sources.</p>

<p>392.	Inspectors will consider, taking into account any exemptions from the learning and development requirements of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr>, how well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>leaders assure themselves that the aims of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> are met and that it is sufficiently challenging for the children it serves. Staff ensure that the content, sequencing and progression in the 7 areas of learning are secured, as appropriate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the content of the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr> curriculum is taught in a logical progression, systematically and in a way that is explained effectively, so that it gives children the necessary foundations for the rest of their schooling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children develop, consolidate and deepen their knowledge, understanding and skills across all the areas of learning in the <abbr title="early years foundation stage">EYFS</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff develop children’s communication and language through singing songs, nursery rhymes and playing games</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff develop children’s love of reading through reading aloud and telling stories and rhymes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>children demonstrate their attitudes and behaviours through the key characteristics of effective learning:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>playing and exploring</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>active learning</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>creative thinking and thinking critically</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>393.	Teaching should not be taken to imply a ‘top down’ or formal way of working. It is a broad term that covers the many different ways in which adults help young children learn. It includes their interactions with children during planned and child-initiated play and activities, communicating and modelling language, showing, explaining, demonstrating, exploring ideas, encouraging, questioning, recalling, providing a narrative for what they are doing, facilitating and setting challenges. It takes account of the equipment that adults provide and the attention given to the physical environment, as well as the structure and routines of the day that establish expectations. Integral to teaching is how practitioners assess what children know, understand and can do, as well as taking account of their interests and dispositions to learn (characteristics of effective learning), and how practitioners use this information to plan children’s next steps in learning and to monitor their progress.</p>

<p>394.	 In addition, when observing provision for 2- and 3-year-olds, inspectors will consider the extent to which leaders and staff are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>knowledgeable about the typical development and characteristics of learning for 2- and 3-year-olds, including their emotional and physical dependence on adults</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>aware of the large difference in development between children who are just 2 and those approaching their fourth birthday</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responsive when children need comforting, and provide support appropriate to the individual needs of the child</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attentive to children’s care needs and use times caring for them as an opportunity to help children’s learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>giving children time to be in familiar, small groups and opportunities to be in smaller, quieter areas for play</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>patient and attentive when allowing 2- and 3-year-olds to express their ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>listening to children and responding to their verbal and non-verbal communication, rather than interrupting them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sixth-form provision in schools</h3>

<p>395.	Inspectors are required to grade the quality of education in any sixth-form provision in schools and to write about the sixth form in the inspection report. Inspectors will use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to be a student in the sixth form.</p>

<p>396.	The effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding students is reflected in the main judgement for the school.</p>

<p>397.	Inspectors will take account of the key judgement areas in the evaluation schedule. They should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the extent to which leaders and teachers have high expectations for attainment and progress and the effectiveness of the systems they use to monitor and develop the quality of sixth-form programmes for all students, including the most disadvantaged and those with high needs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>how leaders and teachers develop a curriculum that provides progression, stretch, mathematics and English for those young people without GCSE grades 9 to 4 (or legacy grades A* to C), as well as work experience or industry placements and non-qualification activities (which may include tutorials, work to develop study, leadership teamwork, self-management skills and volunteering)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the effectiveness of high-quality, impartial careers guidance in enabling all students to make progress and move on to a higher level of qualification, employment or further training when they are ready to do so</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>398.	Through observing teaching and training activities and by holding discussions with students, teachers and support staff, inspectors will consider how well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>students develop personal, social and independent learning skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>students achieve high levels of punctuality and attendance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>students’ conduct and attitudes, including in non-qualification or enrichment activities and/or work experience, prepare them for employment or progress to higher levels of study</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>399.	Inspection of apprenticeships training and T-level technical education programmes are not in the scope of graded or ungraded inspections of schools.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Part 3. Grade descriptors for graded inspections</h2>

<p>400.	This part sets out the grade descriptors that inspectors will use in coming to judgements on graded inspections.</p>

<h2>Reaching a judgement</h2>

<p>401.	Inspectors will make 4 key judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the quality of education</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>behaviour and attitudes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal development</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>leadership and management</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>402.	Where relevant, inspectors will also make 2 provision judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>early years provision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sixth-form provision</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>403.	Inspectors will also make a judgement on the school’s overall effectiveness.</p>

<p>404.	The grade descriptors are not exhaustive. They do not replace inspectors’ professional judgements. Inspectors will interpret the way that grades are described according to pupils’ age, stage and phase of education.</p>

<h2>Ofsted judgements</h2>

<p>405.	Inspectors use the following 4-point scale to make all judgements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>outstanding</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>good</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>requires improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inadequate</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>406.	Outstanding is a challenging and exacting judgement. In order to reach this standard, inspectors will determine whether the school meets all the criteria for good under that judgement, and does so securely and consistently.</p>

<p>407.	In other words, it is not enough that the school is strong against some aspects of the judgement and not against others, but it must meet each and every good criterion. In addition, there are further criteria set out under the outstanding judgement, which the school will also need to meet.</p>

<p>408.	When considering a judgement of good or requires improvement, inspectors will look at whether the overall quality of the school is most closely aligned to the descriptors set out.</p>

<p>409.	A school will be inadequate under a particular judgement if one or more of the inadequate criteria applies.</p>

<h2>Grade descriptors for quality of education</h2>

<p>410.	In order for the quality of education judgement to be outstanding, the school must meet all of the good criteria securely and consistently and it must also meet the additional outstanding criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Outstanding (1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school meets all the criteria for a good quality of education securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The quality of education provided is exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum intent and implementation are embedded securely and consistently across the school. It is evident from what teachers do that they have a firm and common understanding of the school’s curriculum intent and what it means for their practice. Across all parts of the school, series of lessons contribute well to delivering the curriculum intent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work given enables pupils, over time and across the school, to consistently achieve the aims of the curriculum, which is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ work across the curriculum is consistently of a high quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils consistently achieve highly, particularly the most disadvantaged. Pupils with SEND achieve exceptionally well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>411.	In order to judge whether a school is good or requires improvement, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the inspection team’s professional judgement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders adopt or construct a curriculum that is ambitious and designed to give all pupils, particularly disadvantaged pupils and pupils with SEND, the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life. This is either the national curriculum or a curriculum of comparable breadth and ambition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum may undergo necessary changes (for example, following a review by senior leaders or to take account of COVID-19) and certain aspects may be more developed than others. Where this is the case, these changes do not prevent all pupils having access to an appropriately broad and ambitious curriculum. Where adaptations to curriculum breadth are made for particular pupils, there is a clear rationale for why this is in those pupils’ interests, and, where appropriate, there is a clear plan for returning all pupils to studying the full curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils study the full curriculum; it is not narrowed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>in primary schools, a broad range of subjects (exemplified by the national curriculum) is taught in key stage 2 throughout each and all of Years 3 to 6</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>in secondary schools, the school teaches a broad range of subjects (exemplified by the national curriculum) throughout Years 7 to 9. The school’s aim is to have the EBacc at the heart of its curriculum, in line with the DfE’s ambition where this applies, and good progress has been made towards this ambition.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum is successfully adapted, designed or developed to be ambitious and meet the needs of pupils with SEND, developing their knowledge, skills and abilities to apply what they know and can do with increasing fluency and independence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work given enables pupils to achieve the aims and ambition of the curriculum, which is coherently planned and sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers have good knowledge of the subject(s) and courses they teach. Leaders provide effective support, including for those teaching outside their main areas of expertise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers present subject matter clearly, promoting appropriate discussion about the subject matter being taught. They check pupils’ understanding systematically, identify misconceptions accurately and provide clear, direct feedback. In so doing, they respond and adapt their teaching as necessary without unnecessarily elaborate or individualised approaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the course of study, teaching is designed to help pupils to remember long term the content they have been taught and to integrate new knowledge into larger ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any remote education is well integrated within course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers and leaders use assessment well. For example, they use it to help pupils embed and use knowledge fluently, or to check understanding and inform teaching, or to understand different starting points and gaps as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and do not use it in a way that creates unnecessary burdens on staff or pupils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers create an environment that focuses on pupils. The textbooks and other teaching materials that teachers select – in a way that does not create unnecessary workload for staff – reflect the school’s ambitious intentions for the course of study. These materials clearly support the intent of a coherently planned curriculum, sequenced towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for future learning and employment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading is prioritised to allow pupils to access the full curriculum offer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rigorous and sequential approach to the reading curriculum develops pupils’ fluency, confidence and enjoyment in reading. At all stages, reading attainment is assessed and gaps are addressed quickly and effectively for all pupils. Reading books connect closely to the phonics knowledge that pupils are taught when they are learning to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sharp focus on ensuring that younger children and those at the early stages of reading gain the phonics knowledge and language comprehension necessary to read, and the skills to communicate, gives them the foundations for future learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers ensure that their own speaking, listening, writing and reading of English support pupils in developing their language and vocabulary well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils develop detailed knowledge and skills across the curriculum and, as a result, achieve well. This is reflected in the work that pupils produce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where available, impact is reflected in results from national tests and examinations that meet government expectations, or in the qualifications obtained. Teacher assessed grades from 2020 and 2021 will not be used to assess impact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils are ready for the next stage of education, employment or training. They have the knowledge and skills they need and, where relevant, they gain qualifications that allow them to go on to destinations that meet their interests and aspirations and the intention of their course of study. Pupils with SEND achieve the best possible outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils read widely and often, with fluency and comprehension appropriate to their age. They are able to apply mathematical knowledge, concepts and procedures appropriately for their age.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Requires improvement (3)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The quality of education provided by the school is not good.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Inadequate (4)</h3>

<p>The quality of education is likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s curriculum has limited ambition, little or no structure or coherence, and leaders have not appropriately considered content and sequencing. Pupils experience a jumbled, disconnected series of lessons that do not build their knowledge, skills or understanding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pupils’ experiences in lessons contribute weakly to their learning of the intended curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The range of subjects is narrow and does not prepare pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of life in modern Britain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils cannot communicate, read, write or apply mathematics sufficiently well for their age and are therefore unable to succeed in the next year or stage of education, or in training or employment. (This does not apply for some pupils with SEND.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The progress that disadvantaged pupils make is consistently well below that of other pupils nationally and shows little or no improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils with SEND do not benefit from a good-quality education. Expectations of them are low, and their needs are not accurately identified, assessed or met.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils have not attained the qualifications appropriate for them to progress to their next stages of education, training or employment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grade descriptors for evaluating behaviour and attitudes</h2>

<p>412.	In order for the behaviour and attitudes judgement to be outstanding, the school must meet all of the good criteria securely and consistently and it must also meet the additional outstanding criteria.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school meets all the criteria for good in behaviour and attitudes securely and consistently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Behaviour and attitudes are exceptional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils behave with consistently high levels of respect for others. They play a highly positive role in creating a school environment in which commonalities are identified and celebrated, difference is valued and nurtured, and bullying, harassment and violence are never tolerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils consistently have highly positive attitudes and commitment to their education. They are highly motivated and persistent in the face of difficulties. Pupils make a highly positive, tangible contribution to the life of the school and/or the wider community. Pupils actively support the well-being of other pupils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils behave consistently well, demonstrating high levels of self-control and consistently positive attitudes to their education. If pupils struggle with this, the school takes intelligent, fair and highly effective action to support them to succeed in their education.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>413.	In order to judge whether a school is good or requires improvement, inspectors will use a ‘best fit’ approach, relying on the inspection team’s professional judgement.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The school has high expectations for pupils’ behaviour and conduct. These expectations are commonly understood and applied consistently and fairly. This is reflected in pupils’ positive behaviour and conduct. Low-level disruption is not tolerated and pupils’ behaviour does not disrupt lessons or the day-to-day life of the school. Leaders support all staff well in managing pupils’ behaviour. Staff make sure that pupils follow appropriate routines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders, staff and pupils create a positive environment in which bullying is not tolerated. If bullying, aggression, discrimination and derogatory language occur, they are dealt with quickly and effectively and are not allowed to spread.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is demonstrable improvement in the behaviour and attendance of pupils who have particular needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ attitudes to their education are positive. They are committed to their learning, know how to study effectively and do so, are resilient to setbacks and take pride in their achievements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils have high attendance, within the context of the pandemic. They come to school on time and are punctual to lessons. When this is not the case, the school takes appropriate, swift and effective action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suspensions are used appropriately. The school reintegrates suspended pupils on their return and manages their behaviour effectively. Permanent exclusions are used appropriately as a last resort (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusion">statutory guidance on school exclusion</a>).</p>

<p>Behaviour and attitudes are likely to be inadequate if any one of the following applies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders are not taking effective steps to secure good behaviour from pupils and a consistent approach to discipline. They do not support staff adequately in managing behaviour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pupils’ lack of engagement and persistent low-level and/or high-level wilful disruption contribute to reduced learning and/or disorderly classrooms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A significant minority of pupils show a lack of respect for each other and/or staff and a lack of self-discipline. Pupils frequently ignore or rebut requests from teachers to moderate their conduct. This results in poor behaviour around the school.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum extends beyond the academic, vocational or technical and provides for pupils’ broader development. The school’s work to enhance pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development is of a high quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum and the school’s effective wider work support pupils to be confident, resilient and independent, and to develop strength of character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school provides high-quality pastoral support. Pupils know how to eat healthily, maintain an active lifestyle and keep physically and mentally healthy. They have an age-appropriate understanding of healthy relationships and of the protected characteristics.</p>

<h3>Good (2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Leaders adopt or construct a curriculum that is ambitious and designed to give children, particularly the most disadvantaged, the knowledge, self-belief and cultural capital they need to succeed in life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum is coherently planned and sequenced. It builds on what children know and can do, towards cumulatively sufficient knowledge and skills for their future learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a sharp focus on ensuring that children acquire a wide vocabulary, communicate effectively and, in Reception, secure a knowledge of phonics, which gives them the foundations for future learning, especially in preparation for them to become confident and fluent readers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school’s approach to teaching early reading and synthetic phonics is systematic and ensures that all children learn to read words and simple sentences accurately by the end of Reception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school has the same academic ambitions for almost all children. For children with particular needs, such as those with SEND, their curriculum is designed to be ambitious and to meet their needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children benefit from meaningful learning across the curriculum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff are knowledgeable about the areas of learning they teach. They manage the EYFS curriculum and pedagogy in relation to the learning needs of their children. Staff are expert in teaching systematic, synthetic phonics and ensure that children practise their reading from books that match their phonics knowledge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff present information clearly to children, promoting appropriate discussion about the subject matter being taught. They communicate well to check children’s understanding, identify misconceptions and provide clear explanations to improve their learning. In so doing, they respond and adapt their teaching as necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff read to children in a way that excites and engages them, introducing new ideas, concepts and vocabulary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff are knowledgeable about the teaching of early mathematics. They ensure that children have sufficient practice to be confident in using and understanding numbers. The mathematics curriculum provides a strong basis for more complex learning later on. Over the EYFS, teaching is designed to help children remember long term what they have been taught and to integrate new knowledge into larger concepts. This is checked well by staff and leaders. Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and avoid unnecessary burdens on staff or children.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff create an environment that supports the intent of an ambitious, coherently planned and sequenced curriculum. The resources are chosen to meet the children’s needs and promote learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The curriculum and care practices promote and support children’s emotional security and development of their character. Staff teach children the language of feelings, helping them to appropriately develop their emotional literacy (see pages 8 to 9 of the ‘Statutory framework for the early years foundation stage’, which set out the personal, social and emotional development (PSED) area of learning). Leaders and staff are particularly attentive to the youngest children’s needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff give clear messages to children about why it is important to eat, drink, rest, exercise and be kind to each other. They teach children to take managed risks and challenges as they play and learn, supporting them to be active and develop physically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff provide information for parents about their children’s progress, in line with the requirements of the EYFS. They provide information to parents about supporting their child’s learning at home, including details about the school’s method of teaching reading and how to help their children learn to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children develop detailed knowledge and skills across the 7 areas of learning in an age-appropriate way. Children develop their vocabulary and use it across the EYFS curriculum. By the end of Reception, children use their knowledge of phonics to read accurately and with increasing speed and fluency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children are ready for the next stage of education, especially for Year 1 in school, if applicable. They have the knowledge and skills they need to benefit from what school has to offer when it is time to move on. By the end of Reception, children achieve well, particularly those children with lower starting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of Reception, children have the personal, physical and social skills they need to succeed in the next stage of their education. Most children achieve the early learning goals, particularly in mathematics and literacy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children enjoy, listen attentively and respond with comprehension to familiar stories, rhymes and songs that are appropriate to their age and stage of development. Children develop their vocabulary and understanding of language across the 7 areas of learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children demonstrate their positive attitudes to learning through high levels of curiosity, concentration and enjoyment. They listen intently and respond positively to adults and each other. Children are developing their resilience to setbacks and take pride in their achievements.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The school is ambitious for all its sixth-form students, including those with SEND and those who have high needs. This is reflected in the curriculum. The curriculum remains ambitious and is tailored, where necessary, to meet individual needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sixth-form students study the intended curriculum. The school ensures this by teaching all components of the full programmes of study. Any remote education is integrated into course(s) of study, and is well designed to support the wider implementation of the school’s curriculum. Changes may have been made to the intended curriculum to have a short-term specific focus for some or all students. Where this is the case, there is a clear rationale for why it is in those students’ best interests, and there is a clear plan for returning all students to studying to their full programme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers have expert knowledge of the subject(s) and courses they teach. Leaders provide effective support for those teaching outside their main areas of expertise. When relevant, teachers have extensive and up-to-date vocational expertise.</p>
  </li>

Leaders understand the limitations of assessment and do not use it in a way that creates unnecessary burdens on staff or students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teachers create an environment that allows sixth-form students to focus on learning.

<h2>Grade descriptors for overall effectiveness</h2>

<p>421.	Inspectors will use all their evidence to evaluate what it is like to attend the school. In making their judgements about a school’s overall effectiveness, inspectors will consider whether the standard of education is good or whether it exceeds good and is outstanding. If it is not good, then inspectors will consider whether it requires improvement or is inadequate.</p>

<p>422.	In judging the school’s overall effectiveness, inspectors will take account of the 4 key judgements.</p>

<p>423.	In coming to each of these key judgements, inspectors will also draw on evidence from the inspection of any early years provision or sixth-form provision and consider its impact in the wider context of the school.</p>

<p>424.	Inspectors will judge the effectiveness of any early years provision or sixth-form provision. For either case or both, inspectors will give a grade, summarise the key findings and explain the effectiveness grading in the inspection report. However, inspectors may decide not to give a grade and not to report on the early years or sixth-form provision if there is the risk that it is possible to identify individual pupils because numbers are so small. Typically, this will be when there are fewer than 5 pupils.</p>

<p>425.	The grade for early years and/or the grade for the sixth-form provision may be the same as, or higher or lower than, the overall effectiveness grade. Inspectors will take into account the size of the early years and sixth-form provision in relation to the size of the school when considering the impact of these judgements on the overall effectiveness grade. Inspectors will explain any difference between the early years and/or sixth-form provision grade(s) and the overall effectiveness grade in the report.</p>

<p>426.	Inspectors will always make a written judgement about the effectiveness of the arrangements for safeguarding pupils.</p>

<p>427.	Before making the final judgement on overall effectiveness, inspectors will always consider the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils at the school, and evaluate the extent to which the school’s education provision meets different pupils’ needs, including pupils with <abbr title="special educational needs and/or disabilities">SEND</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Part 4. Urgent inspections</h2>

<p>428.	Under section 8(2) of the Education Act 2005 (the Act), Ofsted can carry out inspections to follow up concerns about schools that are not in a category of concern but that have been brought to its attention through, for example, a qualifying complaint made to Ofsted or by other means.</p>

<p>429.	Inspectors will follow this guidance if we have concerns that the safety of pupils and/or staff is at risk or when information suggests that there has been a serious breakdown in leadership and management or a decline in standards. This might be raised internally through our risk assessment process, or externally through a complaint or other information we receive.</p>

<p>430.	If we receive information about a school that causes it concern, we will weigh this carefully against all other data and information we hold before making a decision on whether to carry out an urgent inspection of the school. The decision on whether to inspect the school is made by the relevant Ofsted regional director. Where an inspection takes place as a result of a qualifying complaint, inspectors will also take account of guidance issued by the national complaints team.</p>

<p>431.	Ofsted does not have the power to investigate individual complaints or incidents of a safeguarding and/or child protection nature. However, such matters may raise whole-school issues, for example about the school’s arrangements to keep pupils safe. It is the whole-school issues that will be the focus of these inspections.</p>

<p>432.	Urgent inspections are selective and focus sharply on the issues raised that caused the school to be inspected. As a result, inspectors will not make judgements on the overall effectiveness of the school or any of the key judgements within the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>. Inspection findings must be made based on the areas of focus. Where the inspection focus is on the school’s safeguarding arrangements, inspectors will take account of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inspecting-safeguarding-in-early-years-education-and-skills">guidance on inspecting safeguarding</a>.</p>

<p>433.	It is important to note that those leading, managing and governing a school are responsible for the effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements. Governors in particular must ensure that the school’s arrangements for safeguarding meet statutory requirements. Concerns about safeguarding may raise wider questions about the effectiveness of leadership and management and governors’ ability to hold the school to account. Therefore, in some cases, urgent inspections will focus on both elements and may be expanded as appropriate. It is the responsibility of the lead inspector, using their professional judgement, to determine the precise focus of the inspection and make sure that leaders are fully aware of this when the inspection begins. An inspection may begin with a specific focus on safeguarding, but its scope may be widened to cover leadership and management or other aspects of the provision where appropriate.</p>

<p>434.	If, during the inspection, inspectors are sufficiently concerned about the overall standard of education provided by the school, the inspection may, under section 9 of the Act, be treated as (‘deemed’) a graded inspection. In these cases, all the judgements required by the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> will be made and a graded inspection report produced and published.</p>

<h3>Before an urgent inspection</h3>

<h4>Staffing and scheduling the inspection</h4>

<p>435.	These inspections are normally led by an <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr>, regardless of the size of the school. However, more inspectors may be required depending on the complexity of the issues that were brought to our attention and that caused the school to be inspected. The inspection will normally last for 2 days. However, it may in some instances be shorter or longer, depending on the circumstances of the school and the nature of the concerns that led to the inspection.</p>

<p>436.	Inspections being carried out as a result of a qualifying complaint made to Ofsted will normally be led by an <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr>.</p>

<p>437.	Inspections that arise from information that we have received should take place as soon as is practicable after the decision to inspect has taken place. The exact timing is, however, at the discretion of the relevant regional director. Inspections arising from our risk assessment process will take place throughout the year.</p>

<h4>Notification</h4>

<p>438.	The notice given to the school of the inspection will be half a day, the same as that for graded inspections. However, we may carry out the inspection without notice. Where this is the case, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will normally telephone the school about 15 minutes before arriving on site.</p>

<p>439.	Where notice of inspection is given, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will make the initial telephone call to the school to inform them that an inspection will take place. If required, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> may arrange a time for a second longer telephone conversation with the headteacher to discuss the inspection. The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will make the purpose of the inspection clear during the initial telephone call with the headteacher. If the inspection is carried out without notice, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> must make the focus of the inspection and the reasons that led to it clear to the headteacher at the earliest opportunity after she or he arrives at the school.</p>

<p>440.	If the school is being inspected because of a qualifying complaint made to Ofsted about the school under section 11A of the Act, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will inform the school of this, as well as that, as a result of the wider issues raised by the complaint, a decision has been taken to inspect the school.</p>

<p>441.	The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will explain that the inspection will focus on the wider issues raised by the complaint and will not investigate the complaint itself. If the complainant has requested confidentiality, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> must take all practicable steps to ensure that the complainant’s identity is not disclosed to the school. At times, the nature of the complaint may mean that the headteacher is able to discern the identity of the complainant. Regardless, <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> should not confirm the complainant’s identity.</p>

<p>442.	The headteacher, at the end of the telephone conversation, should be in a position to understand the reasons for, and the purpose and focus of, the inspection. There is no mandatory requirement for a school to inform parents about the inspection. The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> should invite the school to inform parents so that there is an opportunity for parents to contribute their views about the school through Ofsted Parent View.</p>

<p>443.	Following the pre-inspection telephone conversation, we will confirm the arrangements for the inspection by sending a notification letter to the school. Where no prior notice of the inspection is given, we will provide formal notification of the inspection to the school after the inspector(s) have arrived.</p>

<p>444.	Schools are not required to provide copies of any information in advance of the inspection, but if these are offered, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> should accept them.</p>

<p>445.	Some urgent inspections may specifically focus on behaviour within the school, and these inspections will usually be carried out without prior notification.</p>

<h4>Inspectors’ preparation for the inspection</h4>

<p>446.	The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> must check the provider information portal (PIP) for information relevant to the inspection. The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will brief any team inspectors about the inspection and ensure that the key lines of enquiry and key issues to pursue are understood. Where an inspection is carried out as a result of issues raised in a qualifying complaint made to Ofsted, inspectors must not investigate the complaint itself during the inspection or seek parents’ views on the complaint itself. It is the whole-school issues raised in the complaint that will be followed up during inspection.</p>

<p>447.	To prepare for the inspection, inspectors will review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>copies of any qualifying complaint(s) received, other information on the PIP and any response letters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>issues raised by the investigation of any <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/complain-about-school">qualifying complaints</a> about the school under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/18/part/1/chapter/1/crossheading/investigation-of-complaints" rel="external">the Education Act 2005</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any previous Ofsted inspection report</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ofsted’s <abbr title="inspection data summary report">IDSR</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>information from the pre-inspection telephone conversation with the headteacher</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any documentation emailed to the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> in advance of the inspection, as agreed between the headteacher and the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>During an urgent inspection</h3>

<h4>Engagement with the school’s senior leadership team</h4>

<p>448.	The meeting at the start of the inspection may or may not involve the whole of the school’s senior leadership team. The headteacher may be of the view that a meeting with her or him alone, or with 1 or 2 senior leaders, will be sufficient to limit any potential interruption to the school’s normal routines.</p>

<p>449.	The meeting with school leaders at the start of the inspection will cover pertinent issues about the school and the focus of the inspection. It must give the headteacher and others the opportunity to present an oral summary evaluation of the school’s position on the issues, and identify where evidence may be found.</p>

<h4>Evidence gathering during the inspection</h4>

<p>450.	The kinds of activities carried out during these inspections are no different from graded inspections. However, where the focus of the inspection is on the school’s safeguarding arrangements, activities should focus on safeguarding issues, including, but not exclusively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a review of the single central record and safeguarding policy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a review of referrals made to the designated person for safeguarding in the school and those that were subsequently referred to the designated officer, and their resolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a review of records of staff training on child protection and the prevention of radicalisation and extremism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a review of the school’s procedures for dealing with relevant staffing issues, for example suspensions or disciplinary investigations or actions over issues of child protection and/or safety. This is not a review of individual cases, but of school procedures in dealing with such issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>discussions with pupils and staff</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a check of the school’s internet safety procedures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a review of the personal, social and health education curriculum and how it links to issues of safety and pupils’ welfare</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a review of persistent absence cases and exclusions data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consideration of the views of parents and carers through Ofsted Parent View and, where practicable, through discussions or meetings with parents or groups of parents during the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any relevant issues that appear to be of greatest concern from pre-inspection evidence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any other issues that affect care, safety or child protection and that do not appear to have been tackled fully</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any issues that relate to poor pupil behaviour</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>451.	The exact structure of the day will depend on the issues to be followed up and is likely to be drawn from the sources of evidence described in part 2 above.</p>

<p>452.	During the inspection, the <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> will maintain an ongoing dialogue with the headteacher and senior managers. It is especially important to make sure that the headteacher and senior managers understand any emerging issues. The final feedback to the school, especially when it is challenging, should not be a surprise to the headteacher and senior leaders.</p>

<p>453.	Inspectors will not make judgements on the overall effectiveness of the school or any of the key judgements within the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr>; this is only necessary for graded inspections. If there are weaknesses in a specific area, inspectors may make specific recommendations about what the school needs to do to tackle the weaknesses in that area.</p>

<p>454.	If, however, inspectors have sufficient evidence that some of the core reporting areas for judging a school have declined significantly since its last ungraded or graded inspection, then they will need to consider whether the effectiveness of the provision as a whole has declined. In these circumstances, it may be necessary for the inspection to be deemed to be a graded inspection, under section 9 of the Act. In these cases, all the judgements required by the <abbr title="education inspection framework">EIF</abbr> will be made and a graded inspection report published.</p>

<p>455.	Alternatively, where evidence prompts concerns that overall standards may no longer be as reported under the last graded inspection, but where no serious concerns have been identified, the lead inspector may recommend to the relevant regional director that the next graded inspection be brought forward. The timing of any such inspection should not be indicated to the school. If the inspection raises concerns, these concerns should be reported at the feedback meeting.</p>

<p>456.	Where safeguarding is a focus for the inspection or where it becomes a focus during the course of the inspection, the lead inspector, having reviewed all the evidence gathered during the inspection, will report in the letter whether safeguarding is effective.</p>

<p>457.	If there are relatively minor shortcomings in a school’s procedures and the school is able to resolve them on the day of the inspection, then inspectors can make an assessment that safeguarding is effective. If safeguarding is not effective and/or if pupils are considered to be at risk, the lead inspector will deem the inspection to be a graded inspection.</p>

<h3>At the end of an urgent inspection</h3>

<h4>Final feedback</h4>

<p>458.	The <abbr title="Her Majesty's Inspector(s)">HMI</abbr> and headteacher should discuss which other members of staff, if any, will attend the feedback session, especially if the feedback is likely to be challenging or is likely to raise sensitive issues.</p>

<p>459.	The oral feedback at the end of the inspection, typically towards the end of the second day of a 2-day inspection, must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>report the extent of the evidence base</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cover the issues brought to our attention that caused the school to be inspected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be clear about whether the school’s safeguarding arrangements are effective</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be clear about the findings being made on the specific areas of focus for the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>identify the school’s areas of strength and any aspects that the school needs to improve in relation to safeguarding and child protection, and the specific areas of focus for the inspection</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make clear that the text of the report may differ from the oral feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set out our policy on complaints</p>
  </li>
</ul>
