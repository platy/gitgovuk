<p>This sets out changes we have made to reflect our inspection practice. It does not include corrections or changes made to improve clarity.</p>

<h2>July 2022 (for September 2022 handbooks)</h2>

<p>The names of inspections have been changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Section 5 inspections are now graded inspections</li>
  <li>Section 8 inspections of good and outstanding schools are now ungraded inspections</li>
  <li>Inspections with no formal designation and unannounced behaviour visits are now urgent inspections.</li>
</ul>

<p>The former section 5 and section 8 handbooks have been merged into a new school inspection handbook (covering graded, ungraded and urgent inspections) and a monitoring handbook (covering monitoring inspections).</p>

<p>The content of part 3 of the previous section 5 handbook (‘applying the EIF in different contexts’) has been merged with part 2. The grade descriptors (which were previously in part 2 of the section 5 handbook) have been separated out into part 3. A new part 4 sets out all the guidance for urgent inspections.</p>

<p>The ‘Inspection and the COVID-19 pandemic’ section of the previous handbooks has been removed and incorporated as relevant throughout.</p>

<p>Some terminology has been changed throughout the handbook. References to ‘fixed term exclusions’ are now ‘suspensions’ in line with new DfE guidance. Previous references to ‘gender’ refer only to ‘sex’ in line with legal advice on protected characteristics.</p>

<p>The ‘Privacy notice’ section has been renamed ‘Gathering personal information on inspection’ and updated to focus on inspectors’ powers to gather, use and store evidence.</p>

<h3>School inspection handbook</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Changes have been made throughout the new school inspection handbook to reflect the flow of inspection better and make it easier to understand, especially in explaining key judgements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Added paragraph 12 to explain that Ofsted may carry out research as part of our inspection activities.</p>

<p>The ‘Clarification for schools’ section (paragraphs 13 to 28) has been re-structured and updated.</p>

<p>The ‘new schools’ section (paragraphs 43 to 53) has been updated, including to clarify that if a school changes its URN, it legally becomes a new school, and judgements of the predecessor school are not those of the new school.</p>

<p>Paragraph 156 provides information on how a school can use the Ofsted logo if judged good or outstanding.</p>

<p>Paragraph 184 sets out that where a ‘good: improving’ school no longer believes that they are outstanding, a regional director may decide to cancel a graded inspection and hold an ungraded inspection instead.</p>

<p>In the good grade descriptors for ‘quality of education’, we have removed the previous transitional arrangements and instead added a new grade descriptor to make it clear that we understand schools will change their curriculum and so some aspects will be more developed than others.</p>

<h3>School monitoring handbook</h3>

<p>The previous guidance on monitoring is now all contained in part 3 of the new handbook, with new sections (part 1 and 2) setting out greater detail on how Ofsted approaches monitoring and when it takes place.</p>

<p>There are new judgements for schools following monitoring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[The school] continues to require improvement. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the school to become good.</li>
  <li>[The school] continues to require improvement. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</li>
  <li>[The school] remains inadequate and has serious weaknesses. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</li>
  <li>[The school] remains inadequate and has serious weaknesses. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</li>
  <li>[The school] remains inadequate and in special measures. Leaders have made progress to improve the school, but more work is necessary for the category of concern to be removed.</li>
  <li>[The school] remains inadequate and in special measures. Improvement. Leaders have made insufficient progress to improve the school.</li>
</ul>

<h2>April 2022</h2>

<p>Removed the requirement for local authorities, proprietors or trusts to prepare a statement of action. Statements of action will continue to be required by law, but from Monday 18 April, we will no longer review statements of action on receipt. We will acknowledge receipt of the statement, but it will not be evaluated by an inspector at that time, and we will not reject or endorse any statements. The statement will form part of the evidence base for the first monitoring visit of that school, along with the school’s own improvement plan.</p>

<h2>February 2022</h2>

<p>Paragraph 39, 106, 111, 148 and 379 to 387: changes to reflect Ofsted’s policy on aligned inspections.</p>

<p>Paragraph 41 to 44 and 50: updated to clarify the frequency of inspection.</p>

<p>Paragraph 47: clarifications on what we consider in our risk assessment.</p>
