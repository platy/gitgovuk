<h2>The Medway Flood Partnership</h2>

<p>The Medway Flood Partnership was established in January 2017. It brings together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local partners</li>
  <li>national agencies</li>
  <li>non-governmental organisations</li>
  <li>community representatives</li>
</ul>

<p>The partnership’s aim is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce flood risk within the Medway catchment</li>
  <li>create better places for people, properties and businesses</li>
</ul>

<p>The partnership brings together senior representatives from the following organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Country Land and Business Association</li>
  <li>Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Forestry Commission</li>
  <li>Joint Parish Flood Group</li>
  <li>Kent Association of Local Councils</li>
  <li>Kent County Council</li>
  <li>Kent Flood Action Group Forum</li>
  <li>Maidstone Borough Council co</li>
  <li>National Farmers Union</li>
  <li>Natural England</li>
  <li>Sevenoaks District Council</li>
  <li>South East Rivers Trust</li>
  <li>Southern Water</li>
  <li>Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council</li>
  <li>Tunbridge Wells Borough Council</li>
  <li>Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board</li>
</ul>

<p>Reducing the risk of flooding in the Medway catchment is a complex problem. It is best solved by working in partnership. During the December 2013 flood event, approximately 965 homes were flooded across the Medway catchment. This was devastating for people and livelihoods. Over 9,000 properties across the Medway catchment are at risk of river flooding. Even more are at risk from other sources such as surface water or sewer flooding.</p>

<p>The flood action plan was first published at the end of 2017. It sets out what partner organisations will do to reduce flood risk in the short term. This flood action plan is a significant milestone in addressing flood risk in the Medway catchment. But it is part of a longer journey with the partnership, communities and individuals to build awareness and preparedness for flooding. It will help to identify and develop more actions which can help to reduce flood levels. The partnership will continue to work with communities to develop this plan further and consider the 25 year vision and the pathway to getting there.</p>

<p>This action plan is a ‘living document’. It will be regularly monitored and reviewed by the Medway Flood Partnership to make sure that actions are delivered. It will also ensure that new information and ideas are incorporated. All members are committed to its delivery and embedding an integrated approach to flood risk management into our organisations.</p>

<p>For more information see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-river-medway-partnership-objectives-members-and-action-plan">Medway Flood Partnership: objectives, members and action plan page</a>.</p>

<h2>Capital investment and maintenance</h2>

<p>Actions include traditional, engineered flood defence projects. These help to reduce the risk of flooding to people, property and businesses.</p>

<p>It also includes maintenance of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flood risk assets, such as sluices, to ensure they are in good operational condition</li>
  <li>river channels, including ditch and highway gully clearance, weed cutting, tree and debris removal and desilting of river beds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action 1: Coult Stream flood storage area</h3>

<p>Carry out works to enable the Coult Stream flood storage area to be used more frequently. This will reduce the risk of flooding to homes in smaller events.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Medway at Leigh and Hildenborough</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: March 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 1.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has spent £7,500 on the Coult Stream flood storage area near Snoll Hatch and East Peckham. This ensures it protects 51 properties from a flood with a 1% probability of occurring in any year.</p>

<h3>Action 2: East Peckham scheme</h3>

<p>Carry out feasibility and funding investigations to develop and deliver (if applicable) a scheme to reduce risk to homes and businesses in East Peckham.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: East Peckham</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2017-2022</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Kent County Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress: action ongoing.</p>

<p>In 2021 the Environment Agency awarded the contract for installing Property Flood Resilience (<abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr>) measures in East Peckham to Watertight International. Pre- and post-installation surveys are being completed by RAB consulting. Watertight delivered the Middle Medway Flood Resilience Scheme. As a result they have an excellent understanding of the local geography and fluvial flood risk.</p>

<p>To date, the project team has carried out full surveys of 123 properties. So far, 96 homeowners have signed their agreements to have the measures installed. This is a great uptake and we expect this number to rise as homeowners review their agreements.</p>

<p>Installations started in September 2021 and will run through to October 2022. To date we have installed <abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> measures to 18 properties, with some very positive feedback.</p>

<p>You can find more information and useful resources about <abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> measures on the scheme webpage: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eastpeckhampfr.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Ckathy.aucott%40environment-agency.gov.uk%7Cf827f1ec6cfe4272e23608d9ab456f12%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637729136969752514%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=M6GlMj1ZyuHz8y79MNiwsaqPiVlTjmnFZVdmxklTovk%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">https://www.eastpeckhampfr.com/</a></p>

<h3>Action 3: Leigh expansion and Hildenborough embankment scheme</h3>

<p>Reduce flood risk to 1,470 homes in Tonbridge and Hildenborough by enlarging the Leigh flood storage area (<abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>) and building an embankment in Hildenborough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Medway at Leigh and Hildenborough</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2019-2022</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, South East Local Enterprise Partnership, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency is proposing to increase the capacity of the Leigh flood storage area (<abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>) by storing water to a greater depth.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (<abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>) must give permission to increase the stored water level. This approval is essential for both the Leigh expansion and Hildenborough aspects of the scheme to progress.</p>

<p>In June 2020, the Environment Agency submitted an application to the Secretary of State to increase the stored water level in the Leigh <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>. <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> received 10 objections to the application. Unfortunately, the Environment Agency was unable to resolve these objections. As a result, an Inquiry took place between Monday 26 April and Friday 28 May 2021, to allow concerns to be heard.</p>

<p>The Inspector submitted her report and recommendations to the Minister in July. In September 2021, the Secretary of State confirmed that a compelling case in the public interest had been made. As a result, he accepted the Inspector’s recommendation and approved the application to increase the stored water level without modification or conditions. The maximum stored water level during a flood will increase from 28.05 metres Above Ordnance Datum (<abbr title="Above Ordnance Datum">AOD</abbr>) to 28.6m <abbr title="Above Ordnance Datum">AOD</abbr>.</p>

<p>The decision means that the scheme to reduce flood risk to over 1,400 homes and businesses in Tonbridge and Hildenborough can proceed. The construction contract will be awarded in spring 2022, with construction expected to be complete in autumn 2025.</p>

<p>At Hildenborough, the Environment Agency has continued to work with residents on the final design of the embankment. A planning application for this aspect of the scheme will be submitted in February 2022. The construction programme for the Hildenborough part of the scheme is dependent on the planning decision.</p>

<h3>Action 4: Leigh flood storage area interim works</h3>

<p>Carry out a 3-year programme of engineering works to keep the Leigh flood storage area in good operational condition.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Leigh</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing to 2019</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 3.</p>

<p>The £1.2 million, 3-year programme of improvement works on the Leigh flood storage area (<abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>) is now complete. These works keep the existing flood storage area operational and compliant with the Reservoirs Act until the works to expand the <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> are complete. These works were designed to complement the scheme to expand the Leigh <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>. They included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a 2-year project to refurbish the drains at the toe of the 1.3 kilometre main embankment</li>
  <li>refurbishing the lifting mechanism on the north gate</li>
  <li>replacing the original 1981 switchboard with a new one which will last for the next 50 years</li>
  <li>replacing the original 1981 ‘back-up’ generator with a new generator designed to last for the next 30 years. This generator supplies back up power so the structure can continue to operate if there is a power cut</li>
  <li>refurbishing the Powder Mill stream bridge. This provides access for maintenance, grass clearance and silt clearing</li>
  <li>installing new security measures to ensure the structure is safe and secure</li>
</ul>

<h3>New action 4b: Leigh gauging stations upgrade project</h3>

<ul>
  <li>where: upstream of the Leigh flood storage area</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing to 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Last year the Environment Agency added a new action about its plans to upgrade 8 gauging stations across the Medway catchment. The data from these sites is used to work out when and how to best to operate the Leigh flood storage area control structure in order to maximise the storage capacity available. The works include refurbishing the equipment that collects and records information about river flows and levels, and the buildings which house them.</p>

<p>2 of the 8 stations were upgraded this year (2021/22). 2 more are programmed to be upgraded in 2022/23.</p>

<p>The final 4 are planned to be upgraded 2023/24, though this is dependent on the funding allocated next year. The funding allocation for 2023/24 will be confirmed in spring 2023.</p>

<p>Over the next 3 years the Environment Agency will upgrade 8 gauging stations across the Medway catchment. The data from these sites informs decisions about when and how the Leigh flood storage area is used to maximise the storage capacity. The works will include refurbishing the equipment that collects and records the river flows and levels.</p>

<h3>New action 4c: Leigh flood storage area Reservoir Act works</h3>

<ul>
  <li>where: upstream of the Leigh Flood Storage Area</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing to 2023</li>
</ul>

<p>New action in Year 4</p>

<p>In 2021, the Environment Agency began essential works required to the Leigh flood storage area (<abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr>) under the Reservoirs Act 1975. The works will ensure the <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> continues to safely reduce flood risk to Tonbridge, Hildenborough and downstream communities into the future. The works to the embankment will take place over the next 3 years and will not affect the operation of the Leigh <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> to reduce the risk of flooding.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Aerial view of site showing large strip of black matting extending upwards between green fields. Earthworks can be seen at the top." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151564/Action_4c_-_aerial_-_crop_-_resized.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Laying the erosion matting at the first working area, summer 2021</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>These works will involve lifting the top soil of the existing 1.5-kilometre main embankment and laying reinforcing materials. This reinforced layer will be covered with a layer of soil then sown with grass to further stabilise the surface. Once these works are complete, the embankments will look very similar to how they look now.</p>

<p>Over spring/summer 2021 the team worked on the <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> embankment between A21 Bridge and southern tip of the <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> on Lower Haysden Lane. These works involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>removing the topsoil from the top and downstream side of the embankment</li>
  <li>carrying out works to raise the clay core in the centre of the embankment. This prevents water stored in the <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> from seeping through the embankment</li>
  <li>laying erosion protection matting on the downstream side of the embankment</li>
  <li>improving the drainage at the toe of the embankment so that water flows away more easily. This provides better bank stability</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Image shows black matting on an embankment which stretches in a curve to the right between trees" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/151568/Action_4c_-_matting_-_resized.png"></div>
<figcaption><p>The erosion-protection matting on the downstream side of the embankment has been seeded and will soon be covered in grass</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>During autumn 2021, the team completed the works in the first working area. They then moved their operations to the second working area between the A21 and the main control structure at Leigh. Work at the second working area will take place during spring and summer 2022, with all work complete by autumn 2023.</p>

<h3>Action 5: Middle Medway flood resilience scheme – Phase 1</h3>

<p>Carry out surveys to understand which homes at greatest risk of flooding in the middle Medway area are suitable for property resistance measures. Where homeowners agree, install property resistance measures in suitable homes in the Middle Medway flood resilience scheme area.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Yalding, Collier Street, Hunton, Marden, West Farleigh, East Farleigh, Wateringbury and Nettlestead</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2017-2019</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Maidstone Borough Council, Joint Parish Flood Group, Southern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 3.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the Middle Medway flood resilience scheme was completed in November 2020.</p>

<p>In total, the scheme installed Property Flood Resilience measures to 256 homes across the middle Medway villages. These measures include flood doors, flood gates and air brick covers.</p>

<p>The scheme has cost £1.54 million. This included government funding up to £7,500 per property through Flood Defence Grant in Aid. The Southern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee also provided an extra £195,000 to the project through local levy.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/middle-medway-flood-resilience-scheme">Middle Medway flood resilience scheme</a>.</p>

<h3>Action 6: Middle Medway flood resilience Scheme – Phase 2</h3>

<p>Investigate and implement community level resilience measures to reduce the impact of flooding in the Middle Medway flood resilience Scheme area. Do this with funding from Kent County Council, Maidstone Borough Council and the Southern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee. This includes localised flood defences to reduce risk to homes at greatest risk of flooding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Yalding, Collier Street, Hunton, Marden, West Farleigh, East Farleigh, Wateringbury and Nettlestead</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency, Kent County Council, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
  <li>when: 2018-2020</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Joint Parish Flood Group, Southern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 3.</p>

<p>A study has shown that in discrete locations, small community level resilience schemes could reduce flood risk to property. Unfortunately, none of these schemes meet the value for money criteria. This is mainly because the schemes proposed only assist a few properties. The details have been shared with the property owners involved so that they can take steps if they wish. If new community resilience measures become available they will be investigated and progressed, if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Action 7: Environment Agency annual maintenance programme</h3>

<p>Continue the Environment Agency’s annual programme of maintenance work on Main Rivers across the catchment. This will maintain the flow of water and ensure flood risk assets are in good condition.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Each year the Environment Agency spends approximately £1 million maintaining rivers in the Medway catchment. These works help water to flow freely, and ensure that structures and defences are in good working order.</p>

<p>Alongside our planned maintenance work, our field teams also carry out a wide range of reactive work. This year our field teams cleared vegetation to enable the Reservoirs Act works at the Leigh flood storage area. They also cleared a number of large trees from rivers to keep them flowing. If you see an obstruction in a watercourse that may present a flood risk, please report it through the Environment Agency’s 24/7 incident hotline: 0800 80 70 60.</p>

<p>Find out more about <a class="govuk-link" href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/index.html" rel="external">the Environment Agency’s annual maintenance programme</a>.</p>

<h3>Action 8: Collated maintenance map</h3>

<p>Collate the flood maintenance activities of risk management authorities across the catchment. Share this information with communities to raise awareness of ongoing work to manage flood risk. Also to encourage riparian landowners to carry out their own maintenance</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2018/19 onwards</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action on hold.</p>

<p>There are many organisations that carry out maintenance work to waterways and drainage systems. Each of these organisations has its own programme. As a result, it can be difficult to find out which is planning to carry out maintenance when and where.</p>

<p>The partnership had hoped to be able to bring the maintenance programmes of each of the organisations together into one map. However, having investigated the systems and technicalities of doing this, we have run into difficulties. The Environment Agency’s maintenance map is held on gov.uk and is live so it can be updated at any time. Unfortunately, we are not able to incorporate data from other organisations into the Environment Agency map.</p>

<p>This action remains an aspiration for the partnership, and it may be something we can pursue in the future as technology develops. In the meantime, you can find more information about the maintenance programmes of the Medway partners at the following locations:</p>

<ul>

<h3>Action 9: Maintenance group</h3>

<p>Set up a Medway maintenance group to discuss and review the planned maintenance work of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environment Agency</li>
  <li>Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board</li>
  <li>local councils</li>
  <li>Kent County Council Highways</li>
  <li>Southern Water</li>
</ul>

<p>Involve local community representatives to promote a joined up approach and increase community involvement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board, Southern Water, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Kent Association of Local Councils, Joint Parish Flood Group, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Organisations have continued to share information and coordinate activities. A particular success has been the use of the IDB funding to enable works to control invasive non-native species. This work is essential to raise awareness of, and control, invasive non-native species which thrive in our climate.</p>

<p>Many species use waterways to travel across the catchment. They often clog the rivers and streams with excessive growth which can increase local flood risk. They can also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce the availability of habitat for native species</li>
  <li>reduce biodiversity</li>
  <li>cause riverbank erosion</li>
  <li>increase siltation and flood risk</li>
  <li>cause physical harm</li>
  <li>damage infrastructure and recreation</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the ongoing work to control them has wide-ranging benefits. You can find out more about Medway Valley Countryside Partnership’s work to control invasive non-native species <a class="govuk-link" href="https://medwayvalley.org/invasive-non-native-species/" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Action 10: Culvert inspections</h3>

<p>Carry out a rolling programme of work to inspect Environment Agency owned culverts across the catchment to ensure they continue to convey flows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: annually</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Over 2020, the Environment Agency team reviewed the data on all 196 culverts across the Medway catchment. They then developed a longer-term plan for CCTV culvert surveys.</p>

<p>In 2021 they began delivering this programme, including surveying culverts on the Gas Works Stream in Tonbridge and on the Paddock Wood stream. Over the next year the Environment Agency is planning to survey a further 40 culverts.</p>

<h3>Action 11: Removal of old structures to reduce flood risk</h3>

<p>Work with partners and communities to consider where removing old structures, like retention weirs and automatic sluices, may help to reduce flood risk. Where appropriate, work with partners and the community to carry out these works.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Rivers Teise, Beult and Eden</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2018-2022</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: South East Rivers Trust</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action on hold.</p>

<p>Due to significant resource pressures this year, the Environment Agency has paused the project to remove the Darman’s and Duddies auto sluices near Laddingford. At these sluices the Environment Agency is considering setting a permanent water level that works for all river users. These structures would then be welded in place to prevent them from failing.</p>

<p>The next step is to carry out modelling to test the effect of different water levels. We expect to resume this work once we have recruited more staff to the team. As noted in last year’s report, the Darman’s and Duddies auto sluices near Laddingford cannot continue to operate in the present manner. But as they do not reduce flood risk, they do not attract funding for maintenance.</p>

<p>At these sluices the Environment Agency is considering setting a permanent water level which works for all river users. These structures would then be welded in place to prevent them from failing. As noted in the Year 2 report, the next step is to carry out modelling to test the effect of different water levels. Covid-19 has delayed work on this project this year. But, we can confirm that we have now got funding to progress the modelling of different water levels and what effect they would have.</p>

<p>Once this is complete we will carry out further consultation with the local community to agree any actions.</p>

<h3>Action 12: Watercourse maintenance</h3>

<p>Carry out drainage works and maintenance works to Ordinary Watercourses on behalf of Maidstone Borough Council to maintain flow of water.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Maidstone Borough</li>
  <li>owner: Kent County Council</li>

</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: rolling programme under continual review.</p>

<h3>Action 16: Southern Water asset surveys</h3>

<p>Carry out a targeted programme of surveys of Southern Water assets. This will improve our understanding of their condition and inform our future Capital Maintenance plan.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Southern Water</li>
  <li>when: rolling programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: rolling programme under continual review.</p>

  <li>Paddock Wood</li>
  <li>Tunbridge Wells North &amp; South</li>
  <li>Copthorne</li>
  <li>Wateringbury</li>
</ul>

<p>Use these to understand the impact of weather/climate change and growth on waste water systems. Identify how this impact can be managed to reduce flood risk from sewers to homes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Southern Water</li>
  <li>when: by March 2020</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Environment Agency, Borough and District Councils as required</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 2.</p>

<p>The Drainage Area Plans for 25 sewerage catchments within the Medway River Basin District have been updated. These plans will be used with the Lead Local Flood Authority Surface Water Management Plans to create strategic level plans for the River Basin District. These plans will feed into the Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (DWMP).</p>

<p>Year 4 update: All water companies are preparing the first round of DWMPs. These are expected to be published in March 2023. These plans will set out future investment needs to inform Price Reviews.</p>

<p>Southern Water has set an ambition that, by 2040, flooding from sewers should be the exception. It plans to create resilience against more extreme weather using sustainable drainage approaches. The DWMPs will identify what action is needed, and where working in partnership will help to achieve these outcomes.</p>

<h3>Action 18: IDB watercourse maintenance</h3>

<p>Carry out annual maintenance work within Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board (IDB) district to maintain flow of water.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board</li>
  <li>when: annually</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board adapted its maintenance approach in 2021 to better support wildlife and biodiversity. In the past, it had mowed both banks and cleared all weed from watercourses. While this helped reduce flood risk, it also significantly reduced the food and shelter for a variety of wildlife. Over 2021, the Board changed its approach to mow only one bank and cut 80% of the weed where possible. This has retained important habitats and food sources for wildlife. It has also enabled the Board to carry out maintenance on even more watercourses.</p>

<p>You can view the IDBs <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medwayidb.co.uk/watercourses/conservation/" rel="external">new biodiversity action plan</a> here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medwayidb.co.uk/watercourses/conservation/" rel="external">Conservation – Medway IDB</a></p>

<h3>Action 19: Community Infrastructure Levy</h3>

<p>Support infrastructure projects which will reduce flood risk by considering valid bids for Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) funding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Sevenoaks District</li>
  <li>owner: Sevenoaks District Council</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Sevenoaks District Council’s (SDC) has now held 4 meetings of the CIL Spending Board. The Board has awarded CIL to 23 separate infrastructure projects. Only 1 dealt with flood mitigation and was outside the Medway catchment.</p>

<p>No further bids have been submitted to SDCs CIL Spending Board to bring forward flood mitigation proposals at present. However, future bids may include flood mitigation projects. A guide is available for organisations wishing to submit bids. Anyone wishing to submit a bid can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:cil@sevenoaks.gov.uk">cil@sevenoaks.gov.uk</a> for a copy.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTQxNWRlNGItNzQ4YS00YTc5LTg4NzQtYzc0NmMzMDVhZWFiIiwidCI6ImZjMDc5YWJkLWMyNjgtNGM1Ny1hZDY4LTU4YTFlOWU1NTk4OCJ9" rel="external">interactive tool on the SDC website</a> provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to date information on how much CIL has been received by the council</li>
  <li>how much CIL income there has been from qualifying development in each parish</li>
  <li>how much CIL will be given to the relevant town parish/council</li>
</ul>

<h3>New action: Ightham property flood resilience measures</h3>

<p>Carry out scoping surveys to understand which homes at greatest risk of flooding in Ightham are suitable for property resistance measures. Where homeowners agree, install property resistance measures in suitable homes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Ightham</li>
  <li>owner: Kent County Council</li>
  <li>when: 2018/19</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 2.</p>

<p>Kent County Council has installed property flood resilience measures to 12 properties in Ightham. This is after the flooding in 2016.</p>

<p>The council worked with the community’s Flood Action Group to decide the best way to manage flood risk in the village. The outcome was to provide <abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> for those properties that were eligible.</p>

<p>Flooding in Ightham can happen very quickly. As a result, the community does not benefit from a flood warning system. To manage this, most of the measures installed are passive. This means that they are always in place and so do not have to be deployed.</p>

<h3>New action: Highway drainage pilot</h3>

<p>Use innovative technology to manage highway drainage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Maidstone Borough</li>
  <li>owner: Kent County Council</li>
  <li>when: 2020-2021</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<h3>New action: Mote Park Lake Reservoirs Act works</h3>

<ul>
  <li>where: Maidstone Borough</li>
  <li>owner: Maidstone Borough Council</li>
  <li>when: 2014-2021</li>
</ul>

<h4>New action in year 4: action complete</h4>

<p>This year, Maidstone Council completed essential works to Mote Park Lake to keep it safe into the future. Due to its size, Mote Park Lake is regulated under the Reservoirs Act 1975. The lake had its mandatory 10-year review in 2014. The review recommended works to increase the capacity of the spillway. This will reduce the risk of failure due to overtopping.</p>

<p>As a result, Maidstone Council has carried out works to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>construct a new 50-metre wide secondary spillway</li>
  <li>install a new support of grass covered concrete blocks</li>
  <li>build a new wave wall.</li>
</ul>

<p>The works have now been inspected and signed off by an All Reservoirs Panel engineer. This confirms that the structure is compliant with the Reservoirs Act 1975.</p>

<h3>New action: Five Oak Green property flood resilience scheme</h3>

<p>Install property resistance measures in suitable homes in Five Oak Green.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Five Oak Green, Tunbridge Wells borough</li>
  <li>owner: Tunbridge Wells Borough Council and Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2021-2022</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency and Tunbridge Wells Borough Council are working in partnership to deliver Property Flood Resilience (<abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr>) measures to over 40 homes at very significant risk of flooding in Five Oak Green.</p>

<p>After the flooding from Storm Ciara in early 2020, residents were able to claim a flood resilience grant of £5,000 per property. The Environment Agency is able to count this as a partnership contribution which can be topped up with Flood Defence Grant in Aid (FDGiA) funding. In spring 2021 the Environment Agency developed a business case to request FDGiA funding. We are pleased to confirm that this was approved at the end of July 2021.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has been able to add the Five Oak Green scheme onto the contract with the East Peckham scheme. This means we are able to deliver the scheme more cost efficiently and with less delay and disruption to residents.</p>

<p><abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> includes measures help to reduce the impact of flooding to homes. The measures include flood doors, flood barriers, and non-return valves on waste pipes. So far, 49 properties have received a full detailed survey. 26 properties have signed and returned a homeowner agreement to accept the measures.</p>

<p>We will begin installing measures to homes in early 2022.</p>

<h2>Natural Flood Management</h2>

<p>Actions in this theme of work look at how natural flood management techniques could work in combination with engineered solutions. This is with the purpose of helping to slow the flow of water and reduce the impacts of flooding.</p>

<p>There are a wide range of techniques including measures to help slow and/or reduce flows. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>re-meandering rivers</li>
  <li>targeted woodland planting</li>
  <li>techniques to hold water temporarily on the land</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as helping to reduce flood risk, natural flood management techniques can provide wider social and environmental benefits. This is done by improving our environment for people and wildlife to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Action 20: Supporting <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> through annual maintenance programmes</h3>

<p>Work with partners to consider how our annual maintenance work can support natural flood management measures where they help to reduce flood risk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: annually</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: South East Rivers Trust, Natural England, Upper Medway Internal Drainage Board, Kent County Council, Southern Water, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Joint Parish Flood Group, Kent Association of Local Councils, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency considers natural flood management plans through its annual maintenance programme.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> steering group also plans to bring opportunities for further <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> projects to the Medway Catchment Partnership. This will widen the reach of these discussions to include other partners and organisations.</p>

<h3>Action 21: Improving the River Beult SSSI for people and wildlife</h3>

<p>Identify, investigate and agree options to improve the River Beult SSSI for people and wildlife by working with landowners, local partners and groups. This will include options to slow flood flows and use unoccupied areas of the floodplain to temporarily accept flood water.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Beult between Hadmans Bridge near Smarden and its confluence with the River Medway at Yalding</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2017/18</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Natural England</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 1.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-river-medway-partnership-objectives-members-and-action-plan">Improving the River Beult SSSI for people and wildlife report</a> on GOV.UK in August 2018.</p>

<p>The next step is to put the plan into action. This depends on the cooperation and support of local landowners. The Environment Agency and Natural England will use the plan to continue working with partners and local people to design and build the improvement measures. Further surveys and actions will be needed to inform the design stages. Partnership funding will also be needed and a wide variety of sources will be considered, many of which are detailed in the improvement plan.</p>

<h3>Action 22: Mill Farm</h3>

<p>Provide 12,500 cubic metres of flood storage at Mill Farm, Marden. Use this site to demonstrate the technique to build support for natural flood management measures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Mill Farm, Marden</li>
  <li>owner: Kent County Council</li>
  <li>when: 2017</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Environment Agency, Mill Farm</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 1.</p>

<p>Kent County Council worked in partnership with a local landowner, to complete a 12,500 cubic metre flood storage area in Marden. The site will store peak flows from the drainage ditch network and River Teise which contribute to the flooding within the catchment.</p>

<p>Construction of the £40,000 project took place between November 2016 and December 2017. As well as storing water, the site provides additional habitat across this higher level stewardship farm. This supports a wide diversity of bird life. The site will be managed for wildlife and has no public access so will be an undisturbed haven for wildlife within the local area.</p>

<p>An opening event was held on 18 May 2018 to showcase the flood storage area to other local landowners. A number of follow-up meetings took place with other landowners interested in natural flood management measures.</p>

<h3>Action 23: Paddock Wood</h3>

<p>Investigate opportunities to use natural flood management techniques to reduce flood risk in Paddock Wood.</p>

<ul>

<h3>Action 25: Catchment Sensitive Farming</h3>

<p>Explore how we can use the Catchment Sensitive Farming approach to provide advice to farmers about managing water on-farm that promotes natural flood management measures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Teise and River Beult catchments</li>
  <li>owner: Natural England</li>
  <li>when: 2016 to 2020</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Southern Water (Beult) &amp; South East Water (Teise)</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 3.</p>

<p>Natural England’s Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) team has continued to advise farmers in the Medway catchment on measures to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce diffuse water pollution</li>
  <li>improve soils</li>
  <li>improve the natural flood management capacity of their land</li>
</ul>

<p>Advice and approval has been provided to Countryside Stewardship Mid Tier and Higher Tier applications on water-related options and capital items. This is to protect and reduce farm-yard runoff.</p>

<p>Southern Water is funding the Upper Beult Farm Cluster in partnership with Kent Wildlife Trust. CSF advisors are continuing to work closely with water company partners in the Teise and Upper Beult catchments to provide advice to farmers.</p>

<h3>New action 25b:  Catchment Sensitive Farming</h3>

<p>Continue to use the Catchment Sensitive Farming approach to provide advice to farmers about managing water on-farm that promotes natural flood management measures.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Teise and River Beult catchments</li>
  <li>owner: Natural England</li>
  <li>when: April 2021 to 2025</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing</p>

<p>As reported last year, the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) work in the Medway catchment is continuing with funding from <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr>. Over the past year, the focus expanded to high- and medium-priority water quality areas. It also began to address new themes such as air quality, flood risk and related sustainable farming practices.</p>

<p>The focus on CSF is helping us build relationships with landowners across large project areas in Marden, Shadoxhurst and Lamberhurst.</p>

<p>We now have many 65 Countryside Stewardship and 12 Higher Level Stewardship agreements in the Teise catchment area. We also have 75 Countryside Stewardship schemes and 23 Higher Level Stewardship schemes in the Beult. Our landowner agreements include techniques such as buffer strips, arable reversion and ‘no input’ options. This means they receive no fertilisers or agricultural chemicals.</p>

<p>These measures help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>soil to hold more water</li>
  <li>store water on land</li>
  <li>reduce soil erosion</li>
  <li>prevent agricultural run-off into the watercourse</li>
</ul>

<p>These measures are good for both the landowner and the environment, supporting both food production and flood risk.</p>

<h3>Action 26: Ashdown Forest</h3>

<p>Investigate the potential to hold floodwater in the upper catchment. Achieved by restoring areas of wet heathland in Ashdown Forest through the Countryside Stewardship Higher Tier Scheme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Ashdown Forest/River Medway headwaters</li>
  <li>owner: Natural England</li>
  <li>when: 2016-2021</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Ashdown Forest Conservators</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 2.</p>

<p>Natural England has worked with landowners at Ashdown Forest to agree a Countryside Stewardship agreement which will fund the 7,500 cubic metre pond restoration work. The agreement was signed in January 2019 and the landowner has planned work to take place in autumn/winter 2019.</p>

<h3>Action 27: West Kent Woods</h3>

<p>Explore the potential for natural flood management techniques in the West Kent Woods ecological network around Sevenoaks, Hildenborough, Hadlow and Kings Hill. This will include the use of attenuation methods to slow the flow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: River Bourne</li>
  <li>owner: Natural England</li>
  <li>when: 2017-2020</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Natural England Condition Assessment team has visited Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the area including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scord’s Wood</li>
  <li>Oldbury</li>
  <li>One Tree Hill</li>
  <li>Knole Park.</li>
</ul>

<p>At these visits the team provide advice to landowners on actions they can take to get the SSSIs into Favourable Condition (if they are not already.) This includes woodland management actions which could include or support natural flood management. These visits are part of a continuous process. We are planning to revisit sites on a rotational basis to continue to provide advice.</p>

<p>In 2021, 2 large Countryside Stewardship agreements were established along the river Bourne. These have led to the creation of ‘no input’ grassland habitats which will restore soil and improve water retention and run off.</p>

<h3>Action 28: Countryside Stewardship</h3>

<p>Invest in Countryside Stewardship agreements in the catchment. Include creation/restoration/maintenance of diverse habitats to improve water quality and reduce run-off/erosion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>

<p>Through 2021, we have continued to work with landowners in 3 project areas in the Beult and Teise catchments. This work includes some large Higher Tier schemes, which will begin in 2022. The schemes will help reduce run off by converting arable fields into permanent grassland nature restoration areas.</p>

<p>This year, Countryside Stewardship funding has also delivered natural flood management in woodlands in Shadoxhurst. This included woody dams which complement another <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> project delivered by <abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> in the same woods. These works were in the headwaters of the Beult so will help slow the flow of water in the upper catchment.</p>

<h3>Action 29: Priority <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> sub-catchments</h3>

<p>Through the <abbr title="Flood Resilient Areas by Multi-layEr Safety Approach">FRAMES</abbr> project, identify priority sub-catchments where natural flood management techniques will achieve greatest benefit in reducing flood risk in the catchment. Carry out modelling and identify the techniques to achieve this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: South East Rivers Trust</li>
  <li>when: 2017/18</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Environment Agency, Natural England, Forestry Commission, Kent County Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 2.</p>

<p>After wide consultation supported by a variety of evidence, the South East Rivers Trust (<abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr>) identified 2 flood-affected communities likely to benefit from natural flood management in the short term. These are Headcorn and Five Oak Green. In Headcorn around 20 properties are at risk of flooding from the ‘School Stream’. In Five Oak Green approximately 100 properties are at risk of flooding from the Alder Stream.</p>

<p>The nature of the headwaters and surrounding landscape make these catchments particularly suitable for this approach. Also, the small area of these sub-catchments means that natural flood management techniques are likely to have a greater effect. Much has been learnt through the process of identifying these catchments which can be applied elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the longer term it is hoped that interventions in more sub-catchments will have a cumulative effect, and help reduce flood risk further downstream.</p>

<h3>Action 30: Delivering Natural Flood Management</h3>

<p>Through the <abbr title="Flood Resilient Areas by Multi-layEr Safety Approach">FRAMES</abbr> project, work with local communities and landowners in priority sub catchments. Design and deliver natural flood management schemes which will test land-management techniques.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action complete.</p>

<p>Natural flood management (<abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>) uses natural materials to slow the flow of water. It can reduce the chance of flash flooding, and increases water storage. In 2017, <abbr title="Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs">Defra</abbr> assigned £15 million to the Environment Agency for pilot projects to build our understanding of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the effectiveness of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> in reducing flood risk to homes</li>
  <li>the practicalities of installing and monitoring <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> measures across different types of catchments</li>
  <li>the wider benefits that <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> can provide.</li>
</ul>

<figcaption><p>Leaky woody structure in Pembury woods, in the Alder stream catchment</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Medway catchment was successful in gaining £364,000 of this £15-million pot. The South East Rivers Trust (<abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr>) was able to access match-funding of £149,000 from the European Union <abbr title="Flood Resilient Areas by Multi-layEr Safety Approach">FRAMES</abbr> project. Maidstone Borough Council also contributed £65,000 bringing the total funding available for this work to £580,000.</p>

<p>In total the project team selected 4 sites to demonstrate and test <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>. The team worked with 10 landowners to design a range of practical and effective measures. These included 200 Leaky Woody Structures (LWS) and 3,200-square metres of flood storage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alder Stream: reducing flood risk to properties in Five Oak Green. Techniques included LWS and redirecting flood flows away from local homes.</li>
  <li>School Stream: reducing flood risk to properties in Headcorn. Techniques included LWS and an offline storage pond.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project included 2 demonstrations sites at Bedgebury Forest and Sissinghurst Castle. We worked with partners to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>trial and test techniques suitable for the Wealden landscape. These included LWSs, bunds to slow the flow and enhance wet woodlands, and meadow creation</li>
  <li>promote the concept of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> at sites each of which receive over 200,000 visitors each year</li>
  <li>provide test locations for monitoring techniques</li>
  <li>create exemplar projects which demonstrate the wider benefits of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>
</li>
  <li>act as training hubs, where <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> techniques can be shared with contractors, communities and volunteers</li>
</ul>

<p>In total, the project has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduced flood risk to over 100 properties</li>
  <li>provided environmental benefits, including 200m2 of online wetland habitat and 5,750m2 of offline wetland habitat</li>
  <li>enhanced 2.3 hectares of lowland meadow and 11ha of ancient woodland</li>
  <li>established a new <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> delivery sector among local woodland and drainage contractors</li>
  <li>helped share understanding of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> through display areas at Bedgebury Pinetum visitor centre and Sissinghurst Castle Gardens</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p><abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> has carried out an initial scoping exercise to identify priority locations for future <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>. This will enable the Medway Flood Partnership to continue to build on the momentum from the Medway <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> project. <abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> is now working with key partners across the Medway to discuss the scope for delivering more <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> in the future.</p>

<p>As part of these conversations, Kent County Council is funding <abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> to carry out a feasibility study for a second phase of delivery in the Alder Stream catchment.</p>

<h3>Action 32: Building <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> awareness and take-up</h3>

<p>Through the <abbr title="Flood Resilient Areas by Multi-layEr Safety Approach">FRAMES</abbr> project, coordinate existing mechanisms and networks across the partnership. This is to build understanding of the wider benefits of natural flood management techniques. Encourage landowners and tenants to consider implementing them within their current practices.</p>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action complete.</p>

<p><abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> has promoted wider public understanding of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> through articles on its website, webinars and social media. The demonstration sites at Bedgebury Forest and Sissinghurst Castle (see Action 30) are a valuable way of raising awareness of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the sites attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year</li>
  <li>interpretation boards explain <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>, and the range of benefits that the techniques can bring</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr> has produced a comprehensive report about the work done to create <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr>. It has also created case study documents summarising the <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> conducted in the Medway. These case studies are available on <abbr title="South East Rivers Trust">SERT</abbr>’s website: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.southeastriverstrust.org/projects/natural-flood-management-in-the-medway" rel="external">https://www.southeastriverstrust.org/projects/natural-flood-management-in-the-medway</a>.</p>

<p>Although the <abbr title="Flood Resilient Areas by Multi-layEr Safety Approach">FRAMES</abbr> project is now complete, the Medway Flood Partnership’s <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> steering group will continue the work to raise awareness and take up of <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> techniques. We are now investigating how we can build on the legacy of the Medway <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> project and install further <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> across the catchment.</p>

<h3>Action 33: Develop and share <abbr title="Natural Flood Management">NFM</abbr> case studies</h3>

<p>Identify and develop natural flood management case studies from across the country. Build a database of more local demonstration projects and sites suitable for potential walkovers/visits.</p>

<p>Build landowner support for techniques to slow the flow of flood water and other natural flood management techniques through targeted discussions in priority sub-catchments.</p>

<h2>Community resilience</h2>

<p>Actions in this theme consider a broad range of activities to improve community resilience. They aim to reduce the impact of flooding on communities and help them to continue to function during a flood. This might be by ensuring that the power supply is uninterrupted or by managing traffic to prevent properties flooding from road wash.</p>

<p>The Medway Flood Partnership brings together a wide variety of organisations to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>raise awareness of flood risk</li>
  <li>build individual preparedness</li>
  <li>develop emergency planning activities to ensure local communities are ready to respond</li>
  <li>identify community measures to reduce the impact of flooding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action 34: Raising awareness of the Medway Flood Action Plan and developing it into the future</h3>

<p>Run community drop in sessions and workshops to raise awareness of the Medway Flood Action Plan. Develop the plan further to build flood resilience across the catchment and identify next steps for the action plan.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency and Kent County Council</li>
  <li>when: 2018/19</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Medway Flood Partnership</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>We are nearing the end of the first 5 years of the Medway Flood Partnership.</p>

<p>In May 2021, the Environment Agency published an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england-action-plan">action plan</a> to support the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2">National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy</a>. The Medway Flood Partnership is already working on some of the themes and objectives outlined in the Strategy. As such it would be well-placed to coordinate local actions to deliver the national ambitions.</p>

<p>The Strategy Group will meet in May 2022 to discuss how the partnership will proceed and our next steps.</p>

<h3>Action 35: Raising awareness of flood risk to residents</h3>

<p>Support local communities to help build residents’ awareness of their individual flood risk and what they can do to prepare and respond.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Kent Association of Local Councils</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Environment Agency, Kent Resilience Team, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Covid-19 limited face-to-face engagement again in 2021. But despite this, a lot of work has continued to build awareness of flood risk among communities within the Medway catchment. This work includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further updating the Flood Warden training. It aims to empower wardens and communities to run local flood awareness campaigns. Materials to support this are available on the Kent Resilience Forum web pages</li>
  <li>supporting the Environment Agency’s National Flood Action Campaign during the week of 22 November. Locally we included social media advertising targeting Maidstone. Media enquiries led to TV and radio coverage with Environment Agency staff and one of our Tonbridge Flood Wardens</li>
  <li>holding a virtual school visit to Ditton where over 100 homes are at risk. We talked about the risk of flooding and the dangers that flood water poses. We also used fun and interactive exercises to show how to prepare for flooding</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action 36: Extended Floodline Service</h3>

<p>Raise awareness of the Extended Floodline Service and work with local councils to encourage them to register for this free service.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent Resilience Team</li>
</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 1.</p>

<p>The following councils have all signed up to the Extended Floodline Service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maidstone Borough Council</li>
  <li>Tunbridge Wells Borough Council</li>
  <li>Tonbridge &amp; Malling Borough Council</li>
  <li>Sevenoaks District Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this service, Environment Agency Floodline call handlers can provide up-to-date and locally relevant flooding information direct to residents on behalf of the Council. This service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>

<h3>Action 37: Build awareness of how structures work to reduce flood risk to homes and businesses</h3>

<p>Build community understanding about how flood risk assets are operated to reduce flood risk to homes and businesses without increasing risk to others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Kent Association of Local Councils, Joint Parish Flood Group, Kent Resilience Team, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has continued to raise awareness of how flood assets and structures help to reduce flood risk to properties across the Medway catchment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tonbridge Flood Wardens and the University of the Third Age both received a presentation about the Leigh <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> expansion works at their virtual meetings in November 2021.</li>
  <li>the Leigh <abbr title="Flood Storage Area">FSA</abbr> animation (see above) continues to help people understand how the flood storage area works to reduce flood risk to Tonbridge. Since going up on YouTube in December 2019 it has received over 7,600 views</li>
</ul>

<h3>Action 38: Promoting flood awareness</h3>

<p>Continue to promote flood awareness and preparedness and encourage parish councils and community groups to complete and test their own flood plans.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: catchment wide</li>
  <li>owner: Kent Resilience Team and Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent Association of Local Councils</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Work on this action continued through 2021. In January, the Environment Agency met virtually with the Tonbridge Flood Wardens to help them refine their Community Flood Plan.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has again refreshed the gap analysis of community risk and preparedness.</p>

<p>The analysis showed that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>currently there are 155 communities at risk of flooding across the county</li>
  <li>more than 500 trained Flood Wardens across Kent</li>
  <li>over 1,000 are needed across Kent</li>
  <li>the majority of communities don’t have Flood Wardens or flood plans in place</li>
</ul>

<p>The partnership is using this data to encourage communities to create Community Flood Plans.</p>

<h3>Action 39: Local flood forums</h3>

<p>Support communities to establish local flood forums in Headcorn, Ightham and Hildenborough. Develop local resilience plans.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Headcorn, Ightham, Hildenborough - further communities may be added as the project progresses</li>
  <li>owner: Kent County Council</li>
  <li>when: 2017-2019</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: National Flood Forum, Environment Agency</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>Through the National Flood Forum, Kent County Council is continuing to support Flood Action Groups in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ightham</li>
  <li>Headcorn</li>
  <li>Hildenborough</li>
  <li>East Peckham</li>
  <li>Tunbridge Wells</li>
  <li>Collier Street</li>
</ul>

<p>Support has also been offered to the flood committee run by the Parish Council in Five Oak Green.</p>

<p>The National Flood Forum has supported groups during the pandemic through virtual meetings. These groups help to raise questions and concerns about flood risk to the appropriate risk management authorities. They also help to improve communication between these authorities and flood-vulnerable communities.</p>

<p>The groups are discussing forming a countywide group of flood action groups, to offer mutual support and information sharing.</p>

<h3>Action 40: Operational plan for Yalding and Collier Street</h3>

<p>Work with partners to develop a jointly owned flood incident plan, including road closures. This is to support communities during flood events in Yalding and Collier Street.</p>

<p>If this pilot is successful, develop similar plans for other key communities in the catchment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Yalding and Collier Street</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: 2017 onwards</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent County Council, Kent Resilience Team, Maidstone Borough Council, Yalding and Collier Street Parish Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Medway Confluence Operational Framework was used in winter 2020/21. Partners, including parish councillors, fed back that the Framework is a great measure in protecting the community. We have used the feedback received from partners to further improve the Framework for future use.</p>

<h3>Action 41: Flood training</h3>
<p>Run training for Parish Councillors and Clerks in at risk communities to build understanding of all aspects of flooding.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: county wide</li>
  <li>owner: Kent Association of Local Councils</li>
  <li>when: ongoing</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Environment Agency, Kent Resilience Team</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>The Kent Association of Local Councils invited all parish councils to attend one of three Flood Warden training sessions. These were held in February, September and November 2021. Members from 9 parishes attended. However, more work is needed to improve understanding and engagement around the Flood Warden role at the parish council level.</p>

<p>To complement parish council training, Flood Warden training for borough and district council staff continued. This helps by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>building understanding of the role of Flood Wardens to support the Council’s planning for the wider response</li>
  <li>creating a pool of Flood Wardens who can be deployed to areas with no community Flood Wardens in place</li>
</ul>

<p>This year we trained a 21 more staff from 4 different councils. To date, 126 staff from 8 councils across the county have been trained as Flood Wardens.</p>

<h3>Action 42: Flood Wardens</h3>

<p>Recruit, train and maintain engagement with new and existing volunteer flood wardens.</p>

<ul>
  <li>where: Tonbridge, Hildenborough, Edenbridge, Yalding, Little Venice Country Park and Marina, Paddock Wood, East Peckham, East Farleigh, Collier Street. New communities on demand</li>
  <li>owner: Environment Agency</li>
  <li>when: ongoing, as required</li>
  <li>supporting organisations: Kent Resilience Team, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council, Sevenoaks District Council, Kent Association of Local Councils, Joint Parish Flood Group, Maidstone Borough Council</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 4 progress update: action ongoing.</p>

<p>With Covid-19 and physical restrictions in place again in 2021, much of the community engagement work was online. The Environment Agency and Kent Resilience Forum continued to deliver the Flood Warden training as an e-training package. 3 virtual Flood Warden training sessions ran in 2021 resulting in 130 new wardens trained.</p>

<p>We held a new series of 1-hour ‘Bitesize’ events for our existing Flood Wardens between September and December. These enabled us to stay connected with our existing wardens, share learning and best practice as well as expand their training.</p>

<p>We had expert speakers for each of the 4 events held that covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>groundwater flooding (led by the EA)</li>
  <li>surface water flooding (led by <abbr title="Kent County Council">KCC</abbr>)</li>
  <li>how the Leigh Flood Storage area works and an update on the planned expansion works (led by the EA)</li>
  <li>how the Kent Voluntary Emergency Sector supports our response to flooding and links in with Flood Wardens (led by the KRF)</li>
</ul>

<p>There was plenty of opportunity to interact and ask questions, and we received excellent feedback. You can find out more about becoming a Flood Warden here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kentprepared.org.uk%2Fflood-wardens&amp;data=04%7C01%7Ckathy.aucott%40environment-agency.gov.uk%7C2be10625097f4532d1b408d9c012542b%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637752007251365494%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=slrizAyYnbp%2Fw6XjUH%2B6HA2u4mppY4GrwK%2FX%2FKkyua0%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="external">www.kentprepared.org.uk/flood-warden</a></p>

<h3>Action 43: Emergency flood plans for rural businesses</h3>

<p>Develop an emergency flood plan template for rural businesses to ensure they know what action to take in the event of a flood.</p>

<p>Use existing mechanisms to work with businesses and landowners to promote flood awareness and preparedness. Encourage them to complete their own plans.</p>

</ul>

<p>Action completed in Year 3.</p>

<p>Kent County Council Highways have worked closely with the Parish Councils of Yalding, Collier Street and Hunton to plan temporary traffic management measures. These can be deployed when needed to reduce the risk of flooding from road wash. The kit was delivered in Year 1 and the protocol for use was finalised in Year 2.</p>

<p>The measures are part of the Medway Confluence Operational Framework (see Action 40).</p>

<p>They were used during the flood events of December 2019 and February/March 2020. The measures had some limited success. Learning was identified during the multi-agency debrief after the December flood event.</p>

<h3>Action 46: Traffic management measures to reduce flood risk</h3>

<p>Use learning from Middle Medway flood resilience scheme to consider other areas in the catchment where traffic management may help to increase resilience to flooding. Work with local businesses to raise their awareness of how they can help to reduce flood risk.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency is planning a Property Flood Resilience (<abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr>) community exercise for Aylesford next year. The aim is to build residents’ confidence in installing their <abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> measures. It will also raise understanding of where to go for maintenance and repairs.</p>

<p>We plan to use this exercise as a template which can be rolled out to other Medway communities with <abbr title="Property Flood Resilience">PFR</abbr> installations. The template can then also be added into Community Flood Plans and exercised as part of flood plan testing.</p>

<h3>Action 49: Testing community flood plans</h3>

<p>In November 2021, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council withdrew the Local Plan they had submitted in January 2019. They plan to resubmit a new Local Plan with some amendments to meet the higher housing need. The Council is currently refreshing the Evidence Base, including the Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. A new Call for Sites exercise was open between December 2021 and February 2022. This invited landowners and those with an interest in land to promote sites for inclusion in the Plan. The new Plan is expected to be submitted in the first half of 2023, with adoption expected during 2024.</p>

<p>Maidstone Council has published a draft Local Plan to replace the current adopted 2017 Local Plan. Regulation 19 consultation on the draft ended in December 2021. It is anticipated that the new Local Plan will be adopted in January 2023. The draft Local Plan addresses flood risk in proposed new developments and requires that all new developments include sustainable drainage methods to manage surface water flooding.</p>

<h3>Action 53: Managing flood risk in new developments</h3>

<p>Continue to encourage developers to have pre-application discussions to ensure new development incorporates flood risk management best practice.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has continued to provide a pre-planning application advice service this year. This service allows developers to discuss their proposals and gain flood risk mitigation advice before submitting a planning application to the planning authority.</p>

<p>The Environment Agency has talked to developers about 6 sites within the Medway Flood Action Plan area this year. We have encouraged them to include best practice measures in their developments. For example, at one site we advised the applicant to carry out a topographic survey and improve their Flood Risk Assessment. This allowed us to remove our objection and the development was able to take place.</p>

<p>Kent County Council also offers pre-planning application advice where developers can discuss their drainage proposals prior to submitting an application.</p>

<h3>Action 54: Neighbourhood plans</h3>

<p>Encourage Town and Parish Councils who are preparing Neighbourhood Plans to consider sustainable drainage and flooding mitigation measures in their Plans where appropriate.</p>
