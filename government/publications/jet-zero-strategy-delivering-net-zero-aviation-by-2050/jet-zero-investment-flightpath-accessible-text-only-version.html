<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> leading the charge to Jet Zero</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>“The UK is ideally positioned to lead​ the global development and deployment ​of low and zero emission technologies to decarbonise the aviation sector. We are working at speed to develop greener aircraft, produce and use more sustainable fuels, ​ and make our airspace and airports ​more efficient.​”</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP​ – Secretary of State for Transport​</strong></p>
</div>

<p>The <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> was the first major economy to set a legally binding&nbsp;net zero target. In July 2021,&nbsp;our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan">Transport Decarbonisation Plan</a>&nbsp;set out our plans to decarbonise the transport sector. In October 2021, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy">Net Zero Strategy</a> set out our economy-wide plan to achieve Net Zero by 2050.</p>

<p>The government recognises the challenge of decarbonising the aviation sector and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jet-zero-strategy-delivering-net-zero-aviation-by-2050">Jet Zero strategy</a> sets out a clear framework for how net zero aviation (Jet Zero) can be achieved – securing a more sustainable future for our climate and our aviation industry while boosting <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> economic opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are already accelerating the development of ultra-efficient and zero carbon aircraft technologies, and have recently committed to investing a record £685 million in aerospace <abbr title="research and devlopment">R&amp;D</abbr> over the next 3 years. The use of sustainable aviation fuels (<abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr>) will be key to achieving our targets and we have committed&nbsp;£165 million of funding to support the development of <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> plants with a commitment to have at least 5 commercial-scale <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> plants under construction by 2025 – all helping to deliver our target of at least 10% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> blended into the jet fuel mix by 2030.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Our approach to Jet Zero</h2>

<p>We will achieve Jet Zero by having a clear goal and delivering through multiple solutions, with 3 principles which underpin our approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>international leadership</li>
  <li>delivery in partnership</li>
  <li>maximising opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>Jet Zero will need to be achieved through a combination of measures which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>system efficiencies</li>
  <li><abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr></li>
  <li>zero emission flight (<abbr title="zero emission flight">ZEF</abbr>)</li>
  <li>markets and removals</li>
  <li>influencing consumers</li>
</ul>

<p>The first 3 focus on maximising emissions reductions through different technological and operational approaches and offer rewarding investment opportunities in major growth markets.​</p>

<p>There are also potential investment opportunities in the development of offsetting and greenhouse gas removal technologies including nature-based measures, but these will be deployed more widely than for aviation alone and therefore are not covered in this flightpath.</p>

<h3>Systems efficiencies​</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We will be maximising and making efficient use of our existing airspace, aircraft and airports​</li>
  <li>Moving to best-in-class aircraft operations and airspace modernisation could deliver up to 15% of CO² savings by 2050​</li>
  <li>In 2019, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> CO2 emissions per passenger were 22% lower than in 1990 due to efficiency improvements​</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sustainable aviation fuel​</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We will increase <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> uptake, with a target of at least 10% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> blended in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> jet fuel mix by 2030 through a <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> mandate​</li>
  <li>We will kick start private investment&nbsp;into the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> industry through&nbsp;funding, with&nbsp;a commitment to have at least 5 <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr>&nbsp;plants under construction by 2025</li>
  <li>We will establish world class testing and certifying facilities for <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr>, with £12 million committed over the next 3 years​</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zero emission flight​</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We will grow the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>’s market share in aerospace manufacturing as new aircraft emerge​</li>
  <li>We will put in place the policy and regulatory system to enable zero emission aircraft to enter commercial service​</li>
  <li>We will ensure parallel development of aircraft with the energy and ground infrastructure required for their operation​</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our 2035 delivery plan ​</h2>

<h3>Key milestones</h3>

<ul>
  <li>At&nbsp;least 5&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;<abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr>&nbsp;plants&nbsp;under&nbsp;construction in&nbsp;the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by&nbsp;2025​</li>
  <li>Setting an&nbsp;emission&nbsp;reduction&nbsp;trajectory for&nbsp;aviation&nbsp;from 2025​</li>
  <li>At least 10% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuel​">SAF</abbr> in&nbsp;the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> fuel mix by&nbsp;2030​</li>
  <li>Zero emission routes&nbsp;connecting all parts of&nbsp;the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> by 2030​</li>
  <li>10GW annual&nbsp;hydrogen production&nbsp;target by 2030​</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> domestic aviation&nbsp;to reach net zero by&nbsp;2040​</li>
  <li>All airport operations&nbsp;in England to be zero&nbsp;emission by 2040​</li>
