<h2>Introduction by British Ambassador to Japan, Julia Longbottom</h2>

<p>On her 21st birthday, in a speech broadcast on the radio from Cape Town, Her Majesty The Queen dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>This year marks a remarkable 70 years of that service. Her Majesty The Queen’s unshakeable devotion to public service is a true inspiration. There will be celebrations throughout the UK and across the world as communities come together to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee.</p>

<p>Her reign has also seen the friendship and partnership between the UK and Japan grow from strength to strength. So on behalf of the staff at the British Embassy in Tokyo and Consulate General in Osaka, I would like to encourage you to join us in celebrating this amazing and historic milestone!</p>

<p>In this community pack, we share ideas and inspiration for planning your own celebrations.</p>

<p>Julia Longbottom<br>
HM Ambassador to Japan</p>

<h2>Queen Elizabeth II: a brief history</h2>

<p>Her Majesty The Queen is the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years of service to the people of the United Kingdom, the Realms and the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Born in 1926 and ascending to the throne at the young age of 25, her extraordinary reign has seen her travel further than any other monarch, undertaking over 260 official visits overseas. Nearly 100 of these were state
visits, including The Queen’s visit to Japan for five days in May 1975.</p>

<p>In September 2015, The Queen officially became the longest serving British Monarch in history. This means that The Queen has been an important figurehead for the UK and the Commonwealth during times of enormous
social change.</p>

<p>Known for her sense of duty and her devotion to a life of service, she celebrated her Silver Jubilee in 1977, her Golden Jubilee in 2002 and her Diamond Jubilee in 2012.</p>

<p>Moving into her 70th year on the throne, The Queen continues to show her tireless devotion and duty, and this Platinum Jubilee will be marked with both national and international celebrations.</p>

<h2>UK celebrations</h2>

<p>Over an extended four-day weekend in June, the UK will celebrate The Queen’s remarkable milestone with an extensive programme of public events:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2 June, </span> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.army.mod.uk/news-and-events/news/2022/01/the-queen-s-birthday-parade-starts-platinum-jubilee-celebrations/" rel="external">Trooping the Colour</a>
</h3>

<p>Festivities will kick off with the Queen’s Birthday Parade (Trooping the Colour) on June 2nd, which will consist of over 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2 June, </span> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.queensjubileebeacons.com/" rel="external">Platinum Jubilee Beacons</a>
</h3>

<p>The UK’s long tradition of celebrating Royal Jubilees, Weddings and Coronations with the lighting of beacons will be continued to mark the Platinum Jubilee. Over 1,500 beacons will be lit throughout the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas territories in celebration.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3 June, </span> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/event/service-of-thanksgiving/" rel="external">Service of Thanksgiving</a>:</h3>

<p>A Service of Thanksgiving of Her Majesty The Queen’s reign will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral in London.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4 June, </span> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/event/platinum-party-at-the-palace/" rel="external">Platinum Party at the Palace</a>
</h3>

<p>The BBC will stage and broadcast a live concert from Buckingham Palace. Some of the world’s most well-known entertainment stars will join the public in celebration of the most significant and memorable moments from The
Queen’s 70 years on the throne.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5 June, </span> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.edenprojectcommunities.com/the-big-jubilee-lunch" rel="external">The Big Jubilee Lunch</a>
</h3>

<p>Since 2009, The Big Lunch has encouraged communities to come together in a spirit of fun and friendship. This year, the public are invited by The Big Lunch to host their own lunches in the heart of their communities as part of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations.</p>

<h3>Wider UK initiatives in the Jubilee Year</h3>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="https://queensgreencanopy.org/" rel="external">The Queen’s Green Canopy (QGC)</a></h4>

<p>This is a unique tree planting initiative introduced to mark Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee 2022. The initiative invites people across the UK to “plant a tree for the Jubilee”. Tree planting will begin from October 2022 through to the end of the Jubilee Year, and everyone ranging from individuals to groups, communities, and cities are encouraged to take part to enhance our local environment. If you are planning large scale tree planting as part
of your Platinum Jubilee celebrations, you can purchase a commemorative plaque from suppliers, or download a free template to use with local suppliers (more information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://queensgreencanopy.org/commemorative-plaques/" rel="external">official website</a>). Please note that virtual plaques on the “QGC Map” are only available within UK territories and do not cover projects in Japan.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.birmingham2022.com/queens-baton-relay/baton" rel="external">The Queen’s Baton Relay</a></h4>

<p>The Baton for this year’s relay at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham will incorporate a platinum band across its shaft to signify the momentous occasion of the Platinum Jubilee.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/platinum-pudding" rel="external">The Platinum Pudding Competition</a></h4>

<p>A nationwide baking competition was launched to create a brand new pudding dedicated to The Queen to mark the Platinum Jubilee. People across the UK aged 8 and over were invited to devise the perfect Platinum Pudding recipe. Five finalists prepared their Platinum pudding to be judged by Dame Mary Berry, Monica Galetti and Buckingham Palace Head Chef, Mark Flanagan. The winning recipe will be made available to the public and people can enjoy it at the Big Jubilee Lunch.</p>

<h4><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/full-list-of-places-aiming-to-become-jubilee-cities-revealed">City Status Competition</a></h4>

<p>A city status competition, open to Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies as well as towns across the UK, is being launched. Towns are encouraged to apply to win city status as part of a competition being run in honour of the 2022 Platinum Jubilee. Winning city status provides new opportunities for people who live there, as well as boosting local communities. A total of 38 places have applied, from towns across the UK to even places as far away as the Falkland islands.</p>

<h2>Platinum Jubilee celebrations in Japan</h2>

<p>The UK and Japan are the closest of friends and partners. From The Queen’s coronation onwards, attended by the then Crown Prince Akihito on his first journey overseas, the relationship has only strengthened during the reign of Her Majesty The Queen.</p>

<p>In this landmark year, we not only celebrate the depth, but also the breadth of that relationship. We are longstanding partners with a rich shared history and are modern champions of innovation and shared values.</p>

<p>The British Embassy in Tokyo, Consulate-General in Osaka and British Council in Japan are marking this special year in a variety of ways. But we cannot do it alone and we are encouraging schools, organisations, communities and you (yes, you!) to get involved and hold your own celebrations in Japan.</p>

<p>Please make sure to follow our social media channels to keep up to date with what we will be doing:</p>

<h3>What will the UK government in Japan be doing?</h3>

<h4>The Queen’s Green Canopy (QGC)</h4>

<p>During Her visit in 1975, The Queen planted several oak trees in Japan as a symbol of the enduring partnership between our countries. We will be continuing that tradition and extending The Queen’s Green Canopy to Japan by planting a commemorative Platinum Jubilee Tree. In addition to this, we were lucky enough to have British actor, Eddie Redmayne OBE join in on the Jubilee celebrations here in Japan. With the help of the British Council in Japan, Eddie Redmayne kindly delivered some trees to be planted at a handful of schools in the Tokyo area.</p>

<h4>Big “Japan Jubilee” lunch</h4>

<p>As with the celebrations held in the UK, The British Embassy Tokyo will be opening its compound to the public later in the year to host a Big Lunch. This will not only be to celebrate The Queen’s 70th year on the throne, but also mark our 150th anniversary. We hope many can enjoy this special occasion at our historic and beautiful Embassy compound.</p>

<h4>Platinum Jubilee afternoon tea &amp; cake competition</h4>

<p>Ten hotels in Tokyo and Osaka have responded to our call to organise a Britishinspired afternoon tea for their guests and to create a cake that is ‘fit for a Queen’. The hotels are: Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi,
Conrad Tokyo, Hotel Century Southern Tower, The Peninsula Tokyo, The Capitol Hotel Tokyu, Imperial Hotel Tokyo, Imperial Hotel Osaka, The Tokyo Edition Toranomon, Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo and The Prince Park Tower Hotel Tokyo. The finalists will be announced at The Queen’s Birthday Party event at the Embassy on the 16th of June, as well as on our social media where the public will be able to vote on their favourite cake. We will be using the hashtag #プラチナジュビリーケーキ to share updates on the Platinum Jubilee Cake Competition, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>

<p>Keep an eye on our social media for the following events and online activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>launch of an LGBT+ manga</li>
  <li>exclusive event at Osaka’s Consulate-General</li>
  <li>the Queen’s Birthday Party</li>
  <li>Platinum Ball</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can you get involved?</h2>

<p>We are encouraging communities, schools, organisations and individuals across Japan to celebrate The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. One of the biggest sources of information on potential ways you can get involved, can be found on the official <a class="govuk-link" href="https://platinumjubilee.royal.uk/" rel="external">Platinum Jubilee website</a>. On the website is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/toolkit/" rel="external">toolkit</a> with recipes, activities, playlists and so much more&nbsp;to help you plan your celebration. You can even map your own events using this <a class="govuk-link" href="https://platinumjubilee.gov.uk/events/" rel="external">link</a>.</p>

<h3>Big Lunch</h3>

<p>Whilst the Embassy will be opening its compound to host a Big Platinum Lunch later in the year, we would love to also see your take on the Platinum Big Lunch in your community. Why not try and encourage your local schools, colleagues, neighbours or friends to do the same over the Jubilee weekend in June? The lunch can be as big or as small as you want, and why not even try your hand at some British cuisine? It may be your chance to show your local community that Britain has more to offer than just fish &amp; chips. If you’re a little pressed for ideas, have a look at the link on the right to see if the recipes can get your creative and culinary juices flowing!</p>

<h3>Tree planting</h3>

<p>For schools interested in planting trees to create disaster preventive forests, known as bousairin, you can contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://morinoproject.com/english" rel="external">Chinju-no-Mori project</a>. They are a Japanese tree planting initiative that is looking for school partners to create bousairin in their school yards. This tree planting initiative was launched after the Tohoku earthquake in 2011, to encourage the growth of disaster-preventive forests. Please check out their website for more information on how you can get involved.</p>

<h4>British Council</h4>

<p>The British council have created a number of fun English materials for you to share with your schools and community. Learn English whilst also learning about the Platinum Jubilee. You can help spread the word of the celebrations and history of Queen Elizabeth II by using the links below.</p>
