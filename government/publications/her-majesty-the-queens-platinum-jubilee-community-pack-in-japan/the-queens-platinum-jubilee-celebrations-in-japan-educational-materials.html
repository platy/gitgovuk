<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Celebrating the Platinum Jubilee: ideas for your classroom</h2>

<p>Are you teaching in Japan? We have some great ideas to get your class and students involved, and share the fun of the Platinum Jubilee in your classroom.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Bunting</h3>

<p>Bunting is something quintessentially British and found at almost every barbecue, birthday, or garden party in the UK. Bunting is pieces of triangular fabric or paper, held together by a length of string and used as decorations to be hung anywhere you like. Why not have your students (or colleagues too), try their hand at drawing the Union Jack, or draw their dreams for the future? If you’re really daring, how about a portrait of The Queen herself? The bunting can be hung in your corridors or communal areas as a reminder of the Jubilee once the festivities end.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Pudding contest</h3>

<p>How about encouraging your students or colleagues to try their hand at making their own cake or dessert at home? You can encourage them by trying to bake a recipe yourself. Here is a fun fact to share with your students: the UK family favourite dish, Coronation Chicken, was invented for The Queen’s Coronation in 1953. The same idea is being promoted this year, in the search for a new pudding fit for The Queen.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span>Queen Elizabeth II Quiz</h3>

<p>At the end of this pack are 10 questions about Queen Elizabeth II and her life. You could encourage your students to do some historical research on Queen Elizabeth II in advance and share the Q&amp;A with them below, to see how much information they were able to gather. It would be a great way to add a competitive spin on getting your students to learn about Queen Elizabeth II and her reign.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span>UK’s National Anthem</h3>

<p>Does your school have a music teacher or an after school music club? Why not share the score for ‘God Save the Queen’ with them? Not only will it give them the chance to learn a new song, but they can try their hand at singing it in English too. You can find more information on the national anthem in the following link: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.royal.uk/national-anthem" rel="external">National Anthem</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5 </span>Painting competition</h3>

<p>Another fun way to share and celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee whilst encouraging your students to explore their arty side. Why not ask them to paint or draw a picture of Queen Elizabeth II, or something royal related, and display the best three. This is another chance to also get your fellow teachers involved, and have your students show off their artistic qualities.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span>True or false game</h3>

<p>On the next page are a number of statements relating to Queen Elizabeth II and her reign over the past 70 years. Some are true, some are false. How many of the facts can your students get right? Some of them may surprise
you!</p>

<p>We encourage you to share your celebrations where possible by using the hashtags #PlatinumJubilee and #HM70 on your social media channels.</p>

<p>If you managed to hold a successful lesson, activity or event with your school, we would love to hear about it. You can email us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Japan.PlatinumJubilee@fcdo.gov.uk">Japan.PlatinumJubilee@fcdo.gov.uk</a> to share your celebrations with us.</p>
