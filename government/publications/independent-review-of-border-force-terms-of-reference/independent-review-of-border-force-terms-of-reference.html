<p>Our border is the first physical intervention point, crucial for national security and crime reduction but also an integral part of how people use and travel through the Border and Immigration system. It balances both security and prosperity.</p>

<p>The complexity and scale of the challenge at the border has escalated over the past 18 months through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the rapid response to COVID-19 leading to implementation of health measures at the border and the disrupted flow of passengers</li>
  <li>post EU Transition period requiring the implementation of increased customs requirements on goods and a new immigration systems for EEA nationals</li>
  <li>an evolving threat and risk picture – including channel crossings</li>
</ul>

<p>Our departure from the European Union provides a unique opportunity to create a border that is fit for the future as we embark on a new chapter as a fully independent and sovereign United Kingdom.</p>

<p>It is essential that UK Border Force is able to deliver across a wide range of government priorities and changing trends across trade, migration and security to keep the UK safe and prosperous.</p>

<p>The issues and challenges the review should consider include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the mission of Border Force as an organisation and how it could be better defined, including the status and powers of Border Force and the capabilities required at the frontline and at leadership level</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>levels of accountability and transparency to task and direct Border Force, and the appropriateness of processes to do so</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the role of Border Force in dealing with the issue of small boat crossings</li>
      <li>oversight for balancing the full range of priorities including security, immigration, fiscal and health</li>
      <li>appropriateness of the funding model to ensure delivery of long term investment in capabilities</li>
      <li>legacy issues from previous organisational structures (Immigration and Nationality Directorate, Border &amp; Immigration Agency, HM Excise &amp; Customs and UK Border Agency) often proving a barrier to workforce changes</li>
      <li>whether Border Force is well placed to deliver on the 2025 Border Strategy, including fully exploiting technology to deliver across all its areas of responsibility</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The reviewer should provide recommendations to the Home Secretary in 3 months.</p>
