<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This information is not meant to be definitive, nor is it to be taken as a substitute for independent legal advice. Neither Her Majesty’s Government nor its staff take any responsibility for the accuracy of the information, nor accept liability for any loss, costs, damage or expense that you might suffer as a result of relying on the information. Some of the information may not be relevant to your circumstances. The language used is intended to be general and factual and is not meant to cause offence.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>When a relative or friend dies abroad, the different procedures, laws or language can cause additional distress. You may be uncertain about what to do or who to contact.</p>

<p>This country specific information is designed to help you through some of the practical arrangements you may need to make. It supplements the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coping-with-death-abroad">general information on death abroad</a> produced by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, which applies to all countries.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, as each country has its own laws and customs when a death occurs, it may not be possible to make the arrangements that you prefer, or at the time you would like.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>&nbsp;How to contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information below, but you may have questions. You can speak to someone by phone 24/7 any day of the year by contacting the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office in London on 0207 008 1500.</p>

<p>If you are not in the UK, this is where you can find the contact details of the nearest&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/world/embassies">British embassy, high commission or consulate</a> online.</p>

<p>The priority of the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office is to provide assistance to British nationals overseas who need the most help. The level and type of assistance they can offer is tailored to the individual circumstances of each case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Next of kin</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements. The next of kin can sometimes appoint another person to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you are not the next of kin, they will need to be informed. If required, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office can help you do this.</p>

<p>There is no legal definition of next of kin in the UK. In Eswatini, next of kin may be any individual that has been chosen to represent an individual. This can be a spouse, other relative or any person with power of attorney.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note that same sex marriages and relationships are illegal in Eswatini, so the government may not recognise a same-sex partner as next of kin.</p>
</div>

<p>If the next of kin is abroad and unable to travel the police normally use photographic identification to identify the body visually.</p>

<p>Photographic ID/ passport can be used if found near or adjacent to identify a body damaged beyond recognition. In the absence of photographic identification, dental records, fingerprints or DNA can be used to confirm the identity of a deceased person. According to local authorities, Eswatini has labs that deal with such cases and authorities have told us the turnaround time is 7 days at most.</p>

<p>If there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who died did not choose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications. If there is a dispute in the family over the next of kin, courts will decide over the dispute.</p>

<p>When someone dies, the next of kin in Eswatini or abroad normally notifies local authorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Release of information to next of kin</h2>

<p>The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will try to obtain as much information as possible after your relative or friend has died abroad. Some of this may only be available to the next of kin.</p>

<p>Consular officers may be able to obtain this themselves, or they may put you in touch directly with the authorities overseas. They may be able to provide you with details of others who can advocate on your behalf such as lawyers, charities, or other organisations.</p>

<p>There are no local laws or standard procedures relating to the releasing of information to the family. The local authorities normally release information to the next of kin or family. It is unusual for information to be withheld by local authorities.</p>

<p>The appointed funeral director, next of kin or High Commission usually keep the family informed of any developments.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Appointing a funeral director</h2>

<p>If the person who died did not have insurance, the next of kin will usually have to appoint a funeral director and will usually be responsible for all costs. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office cannot help with these costs.</p>

<p>The next of kin or relative must identify the body. A relative or a next of kin must instruct a local funeral director in Eswatini or an international funeral director in the UK for a body to be repatriated to the UK, or buried or cremated in Eswatini.</p>

<p>However, if the deceased was insured, you should immediately contact the insurance company to establish if they are able to cover for the repatriation expenses and make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>You may need the insurance policy number and the associated 24-hour medical emergency contact number to do this. If the travel insurance company confirms that there is a current policy, you should not appoint your own funeral director or be pressurised by local funeral agencies to do so. It will be the insurance company that will appoint the funeral director both locally and in the UK.</p>

<p>If you decide to bring the deceased to the UK for the funeral or cremation, you may only need to appoint an international funeral director. The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office produces a <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-funeral-directors-in-the-uk">list of international funeral directors based in the UK</a>).</p>

<p>If you decide to hold a funeral or cremation in Eswatini, you can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eswatini-list-of-funeral-directors/eswatini-list-of-funeral-directors">list of local funeral directors</a> online.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Registering the death and obtaining a death certificate</h2>

<p>You will need to register the death with the local authorities in the country where the person died. You will usually need documents about you and the person who has died, which include information such as full name, date of birth and passport number.</p>

<p>When someone dies in Eswatini, you do not need to register the death with the UK authorities. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. In Eswatini, funeral directors cannot register death on behalf of the next of kin. Authorities have told us registration can be done over email if the next of kin is in the UK and unable to travel to Eswatini.</p>

<p>In Eswatini, a death must be registered at the Ministry of Home Affairs offices across the country within 60 days. A doctor who confirms a person has died will provide a certification of cause of death (BMD 10). When someone dies in the villages at home, a chief from the local council writes a letter and it can be used as a BMD 10.</p>

<p>Note that these documents are required in order to formally register the death and receive an official death certificate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BMD 10 certification of cause of death (if the person died at a health facility); or a letter from Umphakatsi (local council), with an official stamp, where the deceased was resident (if the person died at home)</li>
  <li>deceased’s birth certificate</li>
  <li>identity card of the deceased</li>
  <li>identity card of the person registering the death</li>
  <li>a document (i.e. a birth or marriage certificate) that links the deceased with the informant</li>
</ul>

<p>If the death did not occur at home or at a health facility, further documentation may be needed, such a as a police report.</p>

<p>In case of late registration, a requesting affidavit or sworn statement is required. This means the next of kin must write a statement under oath detailing the reasons for late registration. You will need to obtain this from a notary public. A list of lawyers in Eswatini can be found <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/eswatini-list-of-lawyers">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Post mortem examinations (autopsies)</h2>

<p>A post mortem is required in all cases where a person has died in Eswatini and is being repatriated abroad, and in most cases of unnatural or unknown causes of death. The decision to conduct a post mortem is usually made by the police.</p>

<p>Post mortems are conducted on demand (within 1-2 days) by a State Pathologist working on behalf of the Ministry of Justice.&nbsp;The pathologists have the capabilities to perform laboratory testing and toxicology in the local forensic lab.</p>

<p>Families are not charged for post mortems and organs are not retained after post mortem examinations. A next of kin can request a preliminary post mortem report from the Royal Eswatini Police and a private post mortem conducted by a private doctor. There are costs involved if the family decides to conduct a private post mortem.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Mortuary facilities</h2>

<p>Eswatini mortuary facilities may not meet the same standard that you would experience in the UK. Mortuaries are usually attached to local hospitals and private funeral parlours. There are dedicated state mortuary facilities.</p>

<p>The cold storage facilities are available throughout the country. There is a daily storage cost for keeping a body in the mortuary.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Burial, cremation, repatriation</h2>

<p>The next of kin of the person who has died will usually need to decide between a local burial, cremation or bringing the person home, which is known as repatriation. Your funeral director will usually be able to explain the options available, the costs, and help you make arrangements.</p>

<p>Local burial and local cremation is allowed for foreigners. Burials and cremations will only take place once a death certificate has been obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs. A body cannot be donated for medical science. There are no regulations to local scatterings of ashes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span>Maximum period before Interment</h3>

<p>In Eswatini, there is no prescribed period within which burial must take place. This is provided that the remains are not a health risk and are kept in a place of cold storage, approved by the medical officer of the Ministry of Health. The alternative would be to have the remains embalmed or sealed in a hermetically-sealed container, as approved by a medical officer of the Ministry of Health.</p>

<p>If death results from unnatural causes (assault, auto accident, etc.), it is the responsibility of the police to transport the body to the government morgue for post mortem examination.&nbsp;In such instances, the remains may not be removed prior to completion of the examination, which generally is performed on request within 1-2 days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>Embalming</h3>

<p>There is no prescribed period within which embalming must take place, provided the remains are not a health risk and are kept in a place of cold storage approved by the medical officer of the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; Local burial does not require embalming and burials can be arranged through the municipal authorities. This is usually arranged by the funeral directors.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>Repatriation</h3>

<p>The funeral director is responsible for coordinating the following documents required to repatriate the body of someone who has died.</p>

<h4>International requirements for repatriations are as follows:</h4>

</ul>

<p>If you wish to return the ashes to the UK, Dups will need to provide a cremation certificate for you to present to the airline.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note if a local burial or cremation takes place, then an inquest in the UK will not be possible. For more information on inquests, see the information on <a class="govuk-link" href="#coroners-inquest">UK coroners and inquests</a> below.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>Return of personal belongings</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>British passport cancellation</h2>

<p>In order to avoid identity fraud, the passport of the person who died should be cancelled with Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO). To do this, you will need to complete a “D1 form”.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/what-to-do-with-a-passport-when-the-passport-holder-has-died">form and instructions on where to send it</a> is available online.</p>

<p>Police in Eswatini will hold a full investigation into any unnatural deaths and there are no separate procedures for deaths involving road traffic accidents.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span>Deaths investigated as murder or manslaughter</h2>

<p>If the local police have confirmed that they are investigating the death as a murder or manslaughter a dedicated team within the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office will be available to provide support, including by referring you to a specialised organisation.

<p>You should note that if the deceased is repatriated to parts of the UK, a coroner or procurator fiscal may decide to hold an inquest. See the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#coroners-inquests">UK Coroners and inquests</a> below.</p>

<p>If a death is regarded as suspicious the Royal Eswatini Police will investigate in full. If an offender is identified and charged, they will be prosecuted by the relevant Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span>UK coroners and inquests</h2>
<p>{:#coroners-inquests)</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to England and Wales, there may be an inquest. The decision on when to hold an inquest is made by Her Majesty’s Coroner.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Please note, an inquest will usually only happen in certain situations, for example, when someone has died in suspicious, unnatural, and violent circumstances or whilst in detention. If the person who died is cremated and only their ashes are brought home, there will not be an inquest.</p>
</div>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal may decide to call for a Fatal Accidents or Injuries Inquiry.</p>

<p>If you repatriate the person who died to Northern Ireland, there will be no coronial inquest or further inquiry.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span>Legal Aid</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;government only provides legal assistance to suspects of crimes, for&nbsp;which the death penalty can be imposed. Some NGOs provide legal assistance on an ad hoc basis. Not allowing legal representation in criminal cases at Swazi National Courts is contrary to international standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span>Compensation</h2>

<p>There is no compensation scheme for victims of murder, manslaughter or terrorism in Eswatini. You can&nbsp;find information on UK compensation for victims of terrorism overseas <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/compensation-victim-terrorist-attack">online</a>.</p>
