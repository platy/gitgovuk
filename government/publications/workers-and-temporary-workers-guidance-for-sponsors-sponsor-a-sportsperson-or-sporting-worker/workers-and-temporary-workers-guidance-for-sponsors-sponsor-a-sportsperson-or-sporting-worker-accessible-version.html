<p>Version 04/22</p>

<p>This document forms part of the collection ‘Workers and Temporary Workers: guidance for sponsors’. It provides information for employers in the sporting sector on how to sponsor a worker on the International Sportsperson immigration route.</p>

<p>This version of the guidance is valid from 11 April 2022.</p>

<h2>About this guidance</h2>

<p>This document provides information for employers in the sporting sector on how to sponsor a sportsperson or coach on the International Sportsperson immigration route.</p>

<p>The International Sportsperson route is for elite sportspersons or qualified sports coaches who are internationally established and can make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at its highest level in the UK.</p>

<p>This route replaces the following routes (‘predecessor sports routes’) with effect from 11 October 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>T2 Sportsperson</li>
  <li>the sporting provisions of the T5 (Temporary Worker) Creative or Sporting Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications for entry clearance or permission to stay on the predecessor sports routes made, but not decided, before 9 a.m. on 11 October 2021 will be decided in accordance with the relevant Immigration Rules in place on 10 October 2021.</p>

<p>There are also transitional arrangements for organisations who held, or applied for, a sponsor licence under the predecessor sports routes before 11 October 2021 – see <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT2">section SPT2</a></p>

<p>For details of these changes to the Immigration Rules, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-changes-to-the-immigration-rules-hc-617-10-september-2021">Statement of Changes HC 617</a> on GOV.UK.

</div>

<h3>What is the International Sportsperson route?</h3>

<p>SPT1.1.	The International Sportsperson route is for elite sportspersons or qualified sports coaches who are internationally established and can make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at its highest level in the UK. It replaced the following routes for applications for entry clearance or permission to stay made from 9 a.m. on 11 October 2021:</p>

<ul>
  <li>T2 Sportsperson</li>
  <li>the sporting provisions of T5 (Temporary Worker) Creative or Sporting Worker</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT1.2.	A person applying on the International Sportsperson route must have an endorsement from the relevant governing body listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-sports-governing-bodies">Appendix Sports Governing Bodies</a>.</p>

<p>SPT1.3.	Applicants must be aged at least 16 to qualify on this route. If they are aged under 18 on the date of application, they must meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Parental-consent-requirement">parental consent requirement</a>.</p>

<p>SPT1.4.	Applicants applying to enter or remain in the UK for a period of more than 12 months must meet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sportsperson-visa/knowledge-of-english">an English language requirement</a>. Those applying for a period of 12 months or less do not have to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>SPT1.5.	The route allows the worker to bring their dependants (partner and dependent children) with them if they meet the requirements for dependants.</p>

<p>SPT1.6.	International Sportspersons can apply for settlement (indefinite leave to remain) after 5 years’ continuous residence in the UK on this (or another eligible) route.</p>

<h3>Who needs to be sponsored on this route?</h3>

<p>SPT1.7.	You will need to sponsor any overseas national you wish to employ as a sportsperson or coach if they are not a ‘settled worker’ or do not otherwise have immigration permission to work for you in the UK. This includes most <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">EU, EEA</a> and Swiss nationals who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020.</p>

<p>SPT1.8.	You do not have to sponsor certain categories of worker, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Irish citizens (with very limited exceptions)</li>
  <li>EU, EEA and Swiss citizens (and their eligible family members) who have been granted status under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families">EU Settlement Scheme</a>
</li>
  <li>people with indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK (also known as ‘settlement’)</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT1.9.	This is not a complete list. For further information on who does, and does not, need sponsorship, see section S1 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#who-needs">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the sponsorship requirements for the International Sportsperson route?</h3>

<p>SPT1.10.	If you wish to sponsor an International Sportsperson, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be endorsed by the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Sports-governing-body">relevant governing body</a> for your sport</li>
  <li>hold a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT2">valid Worker sponsor licence</a> for the International Sportsperson route</li>
  <li>understand the general requirements for sponsoring a worker – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>
</li>
  <li>understand <a class="govuk-link" href="#What-is-International-Sportsperson-route">what the International Sportsperson route is</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT3">who is eligible</a> for this route</li>
  <li>ensure the worker you wish to sponsor has a valid <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT4">sports governing body endorsement letter</a>
</li>
  <li>assign a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT5">valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> to the person you wish to sponsor and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">pay the relevant CoS fee</a>
</li>
  <li>if relevant, ensure you understand the circumstances in which a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT6">sports player can move to another club on loan</a> and what you need to do if this happens</li>
  <li>keep records for each worker you sponsor – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance</li>
  <li>have eligible key personnel in place to manage your licence and apply for CoS – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence-accessible-version#L4">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for guidance on key personnel</li>
  <li>understand and comply with all of your sponsor duties – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other ways sportspersons can come to the UK</h3>

<p>SPT1.11. Sportspersons (and their personal and technical staff, if applicable) may be allowed to come to the UK as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor">Visitors</a>, without needing to be sponsored, if they meet the relevant requirements. This could be as a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor-visa">Standard Visitor</a> (for up to 6 months) to undertake <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-permitted-activities">permitted activities</a> in the sporting sector</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/permitted-paid-engagement-visa">Permitted Paid Engagement Visitor</a> (for up to one month) to carry out an activity directly relating to their profession if they’ve been invited by a sports organisation, agent or UK-based broadcaster</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT1.12. You may therefore wish to consider whether these routes are more suitable for the worker than the International Sportsperson route. You should note that sports workers who enter as Visitors cannot receive payment from a UK source, except in the limited circumstances set out in paragraph V 4.6 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor">Appendix V: Visitor</a>.</p>

<p>SPT1.13. The worker will need entry clearance (a visa) if they are a national of a country or territory listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-visa-national-list">Appendix Visitor: Visa national list</a>.</p>

<p>SPT1.14. For detailed information on the requirements, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visit-guidance">Visit guidance</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>SPT1.15. There are different immigration arrangements if a sports visitor enters the UK via Ireland. Further information on this can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area">Common Travel Area guidance</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>SPT2. How to get an International Sportsperson sponsor licence</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the requirements you must meet to be eligible for an International Sportsperson sponsor licence.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<h3>General requirements</h3>

<p>SPT2.1.	If you wish to sponsor an International Sportsperson, you must hold a valid Worker sponsor licence for the International Sportsperson route. If you do not already hold such a licence, you must apply for one by completing the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.points.homeoffice.gov.uk/gui-sponsor-jsf/Register/SponsorRegister.faces" rel="external">online application form</a>, paying the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">application fee</a>, and submitting the supporting evidence specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-documents-for-sponsor-applications-appendix-a">Appendix A</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>SPT2.2.	Before applying for your licence, you should read:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for detailed information on the general requirements and the application process</li>
  <li>this section for guidance specific to the International Sportsperson route</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transitional arrangements</h4>

<p>SPT2.3.	You do not have to apply for an International Sportsperson sponsor licence if, immediately before 11 October 2021, you already held either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a valid Worker sponsor licence for the T2 Sportsperson route; and/or</li>
  <li>a valid Temporary Worker licence for the sporting provisions of the T5 Creative or Sporting Worker route</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT2.4.	Your licence (or licences) will have been converted into an International Sportsperson sponsor licence with the same expiry date, licence rating and Certificate of Sponsorship allocation as your previous licence (or licences). In most cases, this will have happened automatically. Some sponsors who were licensed on the T5 route only may have needed to take additional action to ensure their licence was converted into an International Sportsperson licence. We will have written to you separately about this before 11 October 2021.</p>

<p>SPT2.5.	If your licence is due to expire within the next 90 days, you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C5">apply now to renew it</a>. If you need to increase your allocation of Certificates of Sponsorship, you can do so via your SMS account: see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manage-your-sponsorship-licence-sms-user-manual">SMS Guide 2: Manage your sponsor licence</a>.</p>

<p>SPT2.6.	If you applied for a licence under the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">predecessor sports routes</a> in place before 11 October 2021, but your application had not been decided by that date, we will consider your application as though it’s an application for an International Sportsperson sponsor licence.</p>

<p>SPT2.7.	You do not have to pay any additional fees under the above transitional arrangements. However, you will need to pay a fee if you later decide you wish to add another Worker route to your licence and all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you were granted an International Sportsperson sponsor licence under the transitional provisions outlined above</li>
  <li>you were not previously licensed on any of the Worker routes</li>
  <li>you do not meet the definition of a small or charitable sponsor in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/330/schedule/4" rel="external">Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT2.8.	This fee will be the difference between the fee for a Worker sponsor licence for a ‘large’ company minus the fee for a Temporary Worker licence.</p>

<p>SPT2.9.	If you later apply to renew your licence, and you do not meet the definition of a small or charitable sponsor, you will need to pay the full Worker fee for a large company.</p>

<p>SPT2.10. You should also be aware that if you are currently licensed under the T5 sporting provisions only, you will need to pay the full Worker fee for any Certificates of Sponsorship you assign for longer than 12 months on the International Sportsperson route.</p>

<p>SPT2.11. See the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">UKVI Visa Fees</a>’ page for further information on fees for sponsorship.</p>

<h3>Specific requirements for an International Sportsperson sponsor licence</h3>

<p>SPT2.12. In addition to the general requirements for a sponsor licence set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>, your organisation must be a UK-based sporting body, sports club, events organiser or other organiser operating, or intending to operate, in the sporting sector. You must also be endorsed by the relevant, Home Office-approved, <a class="govuk-link" href="#Sports-governing-body">sports governing body</a>.</p>

<p>SPT2.13. You are not eligible to apply for an International Sportsperson sponsor licence if you are either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overseas-based sports club or organisation</li>
  <li>an agent</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sports governing body endorsement</h4>

<p>SPT2.14. Before applying for a licence, you must make sure your organisation has an endorsement from the sports governing body approved by the Home Office for your specific sport (or sports). The list of approved bodies is set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-sports-governing-bodies">Appendix Sports Governing Bodies</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>SPT2.15. Through its endorsement, the sports governing body confirms to us that you are a genuine club or other eligible organisation, and that you have a legitimate need to bring overseas nationals to the UK as sportspersons. For further information on the role of the sports governing body, see ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsorship-sporting-code-of-practice">Sponsorship: sporting code of practice</a>’ on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>SPT2.16. When you apply for your licence, you must send us all the relevant documents listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-documents-for-sponsor-applications-appendix-a">Appendix A</a> of the sponsor guidance, including your sports governing body endorsement (referred to as a ‘sporting body endorsement’ in the online sponsor licence application form).</p>

<h4>If there is no approved sports governing body</h4>

<p>SPT2.17. If your sport does not have a Home Office-approved sports governing body, you should email the Points Based System and Economic Migration Policy team at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:economicmigrationpolicy@homeoffice.gov.uk">economicmigrationpolicy@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>. We will ask the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</a>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sportandrecreation.org.uk/" rel="external">Sport and Recreational Alliance (SRA)</a>, and/or other sports councils, to identify if there is a suitable body who could act as our recognised sports governing body.</p>

<p>SPT2.18. Once the relevant sports governing body which is recognised by Sport England is identified, they will then formulate governing body endorsement criteria in consultation with the Home Office. Once this is finalised and we agree they can endorse applications, you must apply to that body for an endorsement before you apply for a sponsor licence. You must confirm that you will comply with the agreed governing body criteria and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsorship-sporting-code-of-practice">sporting code of practice</a>.</p>

<h3>How soon you can sponsor workers if we’ve had to approve a sports governing body</h3>

<p>SPT2.19. If we’ve had to approve a governing body for your specific sport, and we then approve your licence application, you may not be able to sponsor workers immediately. This is because your governing body must be listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-sports-governing-bodies">Appendix Sports Governing Bodies</a> before we can grant entry clearance or permission to stay to any sportspersons in connection with that sport. The Immigration Rules are usually updated twice a year (typically in the Spring and Autumn). We will advise you of the date that your governing body will be added to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>SPT2.20. You can start to assign <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT5">Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> as soon as your licence application has been approved but you must be careful with the timing because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>once you assign a CoS to a worker, they must use it in an application for entry clearance or permission to stay within 3 months, otherwise it will expire and we are likely to reject their application</li>
  <li>if we decide an application for entry clearance or permission to stay before your governing body has been added to Appendix Sports Governing Bodies, we will refuse that application, as explained in the example below:</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>We grant your sponsor licence in November and allocate CoS to your SMS account. Your governing body will be added to Appendix Sports Governing Bodies on 6 April the following year.</p>

<p>You assign a CoS to a worker on 2 December and they apply for entry clearance on 2 March (the last day they can use the CoS before it expires). We decide the application on 2 April.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the worker’s application will be refused because, on 2 April, your governing body will not be listed in Appendix Sports Governing Bodies to the Immigration Rules.</p>
</div>

<h4>Sponsoring a worker in more than one sport</h4>

<p>SPT2.21. When you complete the online sponsor application form, you can only choose one sport from the list provided in the ‘Sporting body endorsement’ section. If you want to sponsor workers in more than one sport, you must choose one from the list provided and then, when giving your reasons for the number of CoS needed, you can list the other sports you want covered by your licence. You must have a separate governing body endorsement and unique reference number for each sport in which you wish to sponsor workers.</p>

<p>SPT2.22. If a sport does not appear on the list on the online application form, you can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:BusinessHelpdesk@homeoffice.gov.uk">BusinessHelpdesk@homeoffice.gov.uk</a> for advice.</p>

<h3>How to keep your licence</h3>

<p>SPT2.23. If you are granted a licence, you must comply with all of your sponsor duties. If you do not, we may take action against you, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>downgrading your licence</li>
  <li>suspending your licence</li>
  <li>revoking your licence</li>
  <li>reporting you to the police or other relevant authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT2.24. For details, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<h3>Points requirement</h3>

<h4>Financial requirement</h4>

<p>SPT3.8.	If the applicant is applying for entry clearance from outside the UK or has been in the UK for less than one year at the date of application, they must show they have enough funds to support themselves and any family members in the UK.</p>

<p>SPT3.9.	If you are an A-rated sponsor, you can certify this requirement is met when you assign a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to them (also known as ‘certifying maintenance’). If you have not certified this requirement, the applicant must provide evidence of funds as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-finance">Appendix Finance</a> to the Immigration Rules.</p>

<p>SPT3.10. For further information, see section S7 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<h3>Genuineness requirement</h3>

<p>SPT3.11. All applicants on the International Sportsperson route must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>genuinely intend and be able to undertake the role for which they are being sponsored; and</li>
  <li>not intend to undertake employment other than in the role for which they are being sponsored, or as otherwise permitted by their conditions of stay – see section S8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on conditions of stay</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parental consent requirement</h3>

<p>SPT3.12. Applicants must be at least 16 years of age on the date of application to be able to make a valid application on the International Sportsperson route. Where the applicant is aged under 18 on the date of application, they must have written consent from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>both of their parents</li>
  <li>one of their parents, if that parent has sole legal responsibility for the applicant; or</li>
  <li>their legal guardian</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.13. The written consent must confirm support for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the application for entry clearance or permission to stay</li>
  <li>the applicant’s living and care arrangements in the UK; and</li>
  <li>if the application is for entry clearance, the applicant’s travel to, and reception arrangements in, the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.14. If you are sponsoring a worker who is aged under 18, you must have regard to your duty to safeguard children – see section L2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence-accessible-version#safeguarding">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a> for further information.</p>

<h3>Entry requirement</h3>

<p>SPT3.15. If the person you wish to sponsor is outside the UK, they must apply for entry clearance (a visa) on the International Sportsperson route before they come to the UK. If they arrive in the UK without the relevant visa, they will be refused entry, even if they otherwise meet the requirements</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Note: the concession which allowed some sports workers to enter the UK for up to 3 months without a visa was withdrawn on 11 October 2021. If you assigned a CoS to a worker who intended to use this concession, but they had not arrived in, and been granted permission to enter, the UK before 9 a.m. on 11 October 2021, they will need to apply for a visa before entering the UK.</p>
</div>

<h3>Extension of permission</h3>

<p>SPT3.16. Workers already in the UK with permission as an International Sportsperson (including on the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Glossary">predecessor sports routes</a>) can apply to extend their stay if they meet the requirements. This could be to continue in the same employment or change employer or employment. See section S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on extension and change of employment applications.</p>

<p>SPT3.17. There is no limit on the number of times an International Sportsperson can be granted permission, provided they continue to meet the relevant requirements.</p>

<h3>‘Switching’</h3>

<p>SPT3.18. People in the UK on another immigration route can ‘switch’ (change route) to the International Sportsperson route if they meet all of the relevant immigration requirements and were not last granted entry clearance or permission to enter or stay:</p>

<ul>
  <li>as a Visitor (unless the <a class="govuk-link" href="#Switching-exception">switching exception for visitors</a> below applies)</li>
  <li>as a Short-term Student</li>
  <li>as a Parent of a Child Student</li>
  <li>as a Seasonal Worker</li>
  <li>as a Domestic Worker in a Private Household</li>
  <li>outside the Immigration Rules</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.19. If a person you wish to sponsor on the International Sportsperson route is in the UK on any of the above routes, they must leave the UK and apply for entry clearance as an International Sportsperson.</p>

<h4>Switching exception for visitors</h4>

<p>SPT3.20. A person who has, or was last granted, permission as a Visitor can switch to the International Sportsperson route if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they were here as a Standard Visitor and undertaking permitted activities in the sports sector, as set out in paragraphs PA 15.1. and PA 15.2. of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-permitted-activities">Appendix Visitor: Permitted Activities</a>; or</li>
  <li>they were here as a Permitted Paid Engagement Visitor and undertaking an activity directly relating to their profession as a professional sports person, as set out in paragraph V 13.3(f) of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-v-visitor">Appendix V: Visitor</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.21. A person who was last granted permission as a Visitor but does not meet the above requirements cannot switch.</p>

<h3>Period of grant for an International Sportsperson</h3>

<p>SPT3.22. If the applicant makes a successful application for entry clearance or permission to stay as an International Sportsperson, and they are applying for no more than 12 months, they will be granted for whichever is the shorter of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 14 days after the period of employment stated on their CoS</li>
  <li>12 months</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.23. If the applicant makes a successful application for entry clearance or permission to stay as an International Sportsperson, and they are applying for more than 12 months, they will be granted for whichever is the shorter of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 14 days after the period of employment stated on their CoS</li>
  <li>3 years</li>
</ul>

<h3>Settlement</h3>

<p>SPT3.24. An International Sportsperson can apply for settlement (indefinite leave to remain) if they’ve lived in the UK for a continuous period of 5 years as an International Sportsperson (or on another eligible route). To be eligible, they must (among other requirements):</p>

<ul>
  <li>have had, during the 5-year qualifying period, at least one grant of permission as an International Sportsperson in excess of 12 months</li>
  <li>be earning a minimum of £35,800 per year (there are rules on how this is calculated)</li>
  <li>be still required for the job in which they were last sponsored</li>
  <li>show English language ability in speaking and listening to at least level B1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, as set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-english-language">Appendix English Language</a>
</li>
  <li>meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-kol-uk">Knowledge of Life in the UK</a> requirement</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT3.25. For full details, see paragraphs ISP 12.1 to ISP 19.2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-international-sportsperson">Appendix International Sportsperson</a>.</p>

<p>SPT3.26. Once a person has been granted settlement, they no longer require sponsorship.</p>

<h3>Further information about immigration requirements</h3>

<p>SPT3.27. You can find more information about the requirements on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sportsperson-visa">International Sportsperson visa</a> page on the GOV.UK website</p>

<p>SPT3.28. You should also refer to sections S7 to S9 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on immigration requirements, conditions of stay, extensions and change of employment applications.</p>

<h2>SPT4.	Sports governing body endorsement letter</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the requirement for an International Sportsperson to have an endorsement from the relevant sports governing body.</p>

<p>SPT4.1.	Before you assign a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT5">Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> to an International Sportsperson, you must ensure the worker has a current endorsement letter issued by the relevant governing body for their sport, as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-sports-governing-bodies">Appendix Sports Governing Bodies</a>.</p>

<p>SPT4.2.	This endorsement confirms that the worker meets the governing body’s requirements, as agreed between the governing body and the Home Office. You cannot assign a valid CoS, and the worker will not be able to make a successful application, without this endorsement letter.</p>

<p>SPT4.3.	The governing body endorsement letter must confirm all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the worker is internationally established at the highest level</li>
  <li>that the worker will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the highest level in the UK</li>
  <li>the unique endorsement number issued to the worker by the governing body</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT4.4.	When you assign a CoS to an International Sportsperson, you must enter the governing body endorsement reference number in the appropriate field.</p>

<p>SPT4.5.	You can only assign a CoS for the period covered by the governing body endorsement. Some governing bodies may only give an endorsement for 12 months at a time, regardless of the length of the worker’s contract. If this is the case, and you wish to sponsor the worker beyond this 12-month period, you must get a new endorsement for the worker, and assign them a new CoS, before their permission expires. The worker must then apply for further permission as an International Sportsperson.</p>

<p>SPT4.6.	In all cases, you must ensure that the worker has a copy of the endorsement letter to include with their application for entry clearance or permission to stay. We will not grant their application without this.</p>

<p>SPT4.7.	You must never assign a CoS to a sportsperson who does not have a current endorsement from the relevant sports governing body. If you do, we will <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C10">revoke your sponsor licence</a>.</p>

<p>SPT4.8.	For more information on governing body endorsement letters, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsorship-sporting-code-of-practice">Sponsorship: sporting code of practice</a>.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>SPT5.1.	If you have followed all the rules in this guidance and you wish to sponsor an International Sportsperson, you must assign them a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> account.</p>

<p>SPT5.2.	Before assigning a CoS, you should satisfy yourself that the worker can meet the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT3">immigration requirements</a>. This includes the requirement for the worker to have a valid <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT4">sports governing body endorsement letter</a>.</p>

<p>SPT5.3.	You cannot assign a CoS if you’re a B-rated sponsor, unless you sponsored the application which led to the worker’s last grant of permission and you’re continuing to sponsor them. In all other cases, you must have an A-rating. For information on sponsor ratings, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-1-apply-for-a-licence">Part 1: Apply for a licence</a>.</p>

<p>SPT5.4.	For detailed information on what a CoS is, and how many you can assign, see section S2 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>.</p>

<p>SPT5.5.	You can find detailed technical guidance on how to assign a CoS on GOV.UK: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators#user-manuals:-sponsorship-management-system-(sms)">User manuals: sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> – see in particular manuals 8 and 11.</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>SPT5.6.	You must pay a fee for each CoS you assign. The amount you have to pay will depend on how long you are sponsoring the worker for – see the ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visa-regulations-revised-table">UK visa fees</a>’ page on GOV.UK for information on current fee levels.</p>

<h3>Use of the CoS</h3>

<p>SPT5.7.	Once you have assigned a CoS, the worker must use it within 3 months to apply for either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>entry clearance (a visa) if they are outside the UK</li>
  <li>permission to stay if they are in the UK and are eligible to extend their stay on, or switch to, the International Sportsperson route</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT5.8.	If the CoS was assigned more than 3 months before the date of application, we may reject the worker’s application and not consider it.</p>

<p>SPT5.9.	The worker must not apply for entry clearance or permission to stay more than 3 months before the start date recorded on their CoS. If they do, we will refuse their application.</p>

<p>SPT5.10. We will also refuse the application if the CoS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has been withdrawn by you or cancelled by the Home Office – see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version#Cancelling-or-withdrawing-a-CoS">section S6</a> of Part 2: Sponsor a worker for information on when a CoS can be withdrawn or cancelled</li>
  <li>was used in a previous application that was refused</li>
</ul>

<h3>What the CoS must confirm</h3>

<p>SPT5.11. For a CoS to be valid, it must meet the requirements of paragraphs ISP 5.2 to ISP 5.4 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-international-sportsperson">Appendix International Sportsperson</a>.</p>

<p>SPT5.12. By assigning a CoS to an International Sportsperson, you guarantee that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are qualified to do the role for which they are being sponsored</li>
  <li>intend to be based in the UK for the duration of their permission to stay</li>
  <li>will comply with the conditions of their entry clearance or permission to stay – see section S8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a> for further information on conditions of stay</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT5.13. The CoS must confirm all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that you are sponsoring the worker on the International Sportsperson route</li>
  <li>whether you are sponsoring the worker for up to 12 months or for longer than 12 months (select the appropriate option)</li>
  <li>the worker’s personal information (such as name, date of birth, nationality), passport details and contact details</li>
  <li>the start and end date of their employment – see ‘<a class="govuk-link" href="#How-long-you-can-assign-a-CoS">How long you can assign a CoS to an International Sportsperson</a>’ below)</li>
  <li>where the worker will carry out their employment – this should include their main work address and any other regular work addresses, if relevant</li>
  <li>whether the worker was sourced through an agent and, if so, details of that agent</li>
  <li>the job title</li>
  <li>the relevant occupation code (select from the drop-down list under ‘Job type’) – this will be either:
    <ul>
      <li>3441: Sports players</li>
      <li>3442: Sports coaches, instructors and officials</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the main duties of the role for which the worker is being sponsored</li>
  <li>the worker’s gross salary (including any guaranteed allowances and bonuses)</li>
  <li>that the worker has been issued with an endorsement by the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT4">sports governing body</a> – you must provide the unique endorsement number on the CoS and give a copy of the letter to the worker so they can include it with their application for entry clearance or permission to stay</li>
  <li>whether you wish to <a class="govuk-link" href="#Financial-requirement">certify maintenance</a> for the worker (and, if relevant, their dependants) – you can only do this if you’re an A-rated sponsor</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long you can assign a CoS to an International Sportsperson</h3>

<p>SPT5.14. You must enter a valid start date and end date on the CoS.</p>

<p>SPT5.15. The start date must be either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date you expect the worker to start working for you if their application is successful; or</li>
  <li>the day after their current permission expires (if they are applying for permission to stay and you are sponsoring them to continue working for you)</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT5.16. The end date must be whichever is the earliest of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the date you expect the worker to finish working for you</li>
  <li>the end date on the worker’s <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT4">sports governing body endorsement letter</a>
</li>
  <li>12 months after the start date, if you selected the option ‘International Sportsperson – up to 12 months’</li>
  <li>3 years after the start date, if you selected the option ‘International Sportsperson – more than 12 months’</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT5.17. Remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the end date must never exceed the period on the sports governing body endorsement letter</li>
  <li>if the worker will be applying to enter or stay in the UK for a period of longer than 12 months, they will need to meet the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sportsperson-visa/knowledge-of-english">English language requirement</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>SPT5.18. See section S3 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version">Part 2: sponsor a worker</a> for more information on start and end dates.</p>

<h3>Reporting duties and record keeping</h3>

<p>SPT5.19. Once you have assigned a CoS to a worker, you must tell us if they fail to start their employment, are absent without permission, or there are any significant changes to the nature of their work or salary, or to your organisation. For full details of your reporting and other duties, see: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance">Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance</a>.</p>

<p>SPT5.20. You must also keep records for each worker you sponsor as specified in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keep-records-for-sponsorship-appendix-d">Appendix D</a> to the sponsor guidance.</p>

<p>SPT5.21. If you fail to meet these duties, we may <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C10">revoke your sponsor licence</a>.</p>

<h2>SPT6.	Sports players moving on loan</h2>

<p>This section tells you about the circumstances in which an International Sportsperson can move to another sports club on loan.</p>

<p>SPT6.1.	People granted permission on the Worker and Temporary Work routes are generally prohibited from changing their employer, unless they have been assigned a new <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT5">Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)</a> and successfully make a new application for entry clearance or permission to stay (known as a ‘change of employment application’).</p>

<p>SPT6.2.	There are limited exceptions to this, including where a sports player on the International Sportsperson route moves on loan to another sports club.</p>

<p>SPT6.3.	If the relevant sports governing body permits it, sports players can move on loan to another sports club, provided they will return to their original club at the end of the loan period. If your player is moving on loan, you must report this to us using your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-management-system">sponsorship management system (SMS)</a> account within 10 working days of the move.</p>

<p>SPT6.4.	During the loan period, you continue to be responsible for the player and must make arrangements with the loan club so that you can continue to meet your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-3-sponsor-duties-and-compliance-accessible-version#C1">sponsorship duties</a>. The loan club does not need to make an application for a sports governing body endorsement or have a sponsor licence. When the player returns to you at the end of the loan period, you must report this to us, using your SMS account, within 10 working days of the player’s return.</p>

<p>SPT6.5.	If your player is permanently transferred to another UK club, you must use your SMS account to tell us you are no longer sponsoring them. The new club must be a licensed sponsor and make an application for a sports governing body endorsement for the player. The player must then make a new application for entry clearance or permission to stay. The player must have been granted entry clearance or permission to stay before they can start playing for their new club .</p>

<p>SPT6.6.	Players on loan from an overseas club to a UK club must meet all of the requirements to be granted entry clearance or permission to stay on the International Sportsperson route – this includes the requirement to have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#SPT4">sports governing body endorsement</a>.</p>

<p>SPT6.7.	For further information on conditions of stay, see section S8 of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker/workers-and-temporary-workers-guidance-for-sponsors-part-2-sponsor-a-worker-general-information-accessible-version">Part 2: Sponsor a worker</a>. For information on when an International Sportsperson has to make a change of employment application, see section S9 of Part 2: Sponsor a worker.</p>
