  <li>transitional arrangements where the notice of intention to make a claim for goods intended for removed to the EU is made before the UK’s exit date, but the claim is made after this date</li>
  <li>how and when the evidential and other requirements are different for certain movements involving Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>It also details which sections of the notice provide legal obligations and further detail on what may happen if you fail to meet those legal obligations.</p>

<p>Drawback is a reimbursement of UK excise duty paid to an eligible claimant, providing certain conditions and requirements are met, when eligible excise goods have not been and will not be consumed in the UK (however <a class="govuk-link" href="#claims-for-goods-ni-and-gb">see section 11</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Events that can lead to a claim for drawback</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#dra-back">Paragraph 3.1</a> explains that to claim drawback the UK duty paid excise goods must not be consumed in the UK. Therefore, to be eligible for drawback, UK excise duty paid goods must either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exported</li>
  <li>warehoused for export (provided the goods are not alcoholic liquor goods and that they are subsequently exported from the UK within 6 months of the drawback claim)</li>
  <li>destroyed</li>
  <li>dispatched from a place in Northern Ireland to an EU country</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> How the drawback scheme works</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 66(b) of The Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010. In particular this paragraph imposes additional requirements with which you must comply when dispatching goods from Northern Ireland to an EU country.</p>

<p>To make a claim for drawback you will need to check that you will be an eligible claimant and that your goods will be eligible goods for the purposes of a drawback claim.</p>

<p>You must then complete a ‘Notice of intention to claim drawback’ form (<abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr>) and send it to the Drawback Processing Centre (<abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr>). In addition you must prepare any documentation required to accompany the goods. For example, the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> as described in section 6 of this notice, an export declaration as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7">section 7</a> of this notice or a warehousing advice note when goods are to be warehouses for export as described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-8">section 8</a>. 
You must then make your goods and any accompanying documentation available for inspection and wait at least as long as the minimum period of notice in case we decide to inspect.</p>

<p>When the notice of intention period ends you are able to export (or dispatch, where goods leave Northern Ireland for a destination in an EU country), warehouse or destroy your goods as notified on your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form.</p>

<p>Where goods are dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country, in addition to the above, the excise duty must also be secured by guarantee or payment of duty in the country of destination before the goods are dispatched.</p>

<p>After your goods have been exported (or dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country), warehoused or destroyed you can then complete and submit your drawback claim form with the required supporting evidence.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> will then process your claim and make a decision as to whether or not your claim will be paid. If your claim is successful the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> will pay the duty due to you, normally into your bank account. If your claim is not successful, the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> will explain this in writing and will return your claim form and supporting evidence.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> As a registered brewer, how does the drawback scheme differ if I wish to offset the drawback on my EX46 return)</h3>

<p>This  paragraph 3.4 contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 7(1)(b) of the Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995. In particular this paragraph imposes requirements you must comply with as a condition of receiving drawback on goods dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country.</p>

<p>Note: If you are a registered brewer and you want to claim drawback for goods that will be destroyed as they have become spoilt or otherwise unfit for use, please read <a class="govuk-link" href="#spoilt-product">paragraph 3.7</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a registered brewer and intend to claim drawback on the beer you export, you have the choice to offset the amount of duty drawback on your EX46 return rather than submit a drawback claim form and await payment from the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr>. If you choose this option the procedure for claiming drawback is different from the standard procedure outlined at <a class="govuk-link" href="#dra-work">paragraph 3.3</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to check that you will be an eligible claimant and that your goods will be eligible goods for the purposes of a drawback claim.</p>

<p>You must complete the ‘Notice of intention to claim drawback’ form (<abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr>) including ticking the box to say you are offsetting the drawback on your EX46 return and send it to the Drawback Processing Centre (<abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr>). You must prepare any documentation required to accompany the movement for example the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> or export declaration on <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr>. You must then make your goods and any accompanying documentation available for inspection and wait at least as long as the minimum period of notice in case we decide to inspect.</p>

<p>When the notice of intention period ends you are then able to dispatch, export or destroy your goods as notified on your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form.</p>

<p>Note: where goods are dispatched to an EU country, in addition to the above, the excise duty must also be secured by guarantee or payment of duty in the country of destination before the goods are dispatched.</p>

<p>After your goods have been exported (or in the case of Northern Ireland, dispatched to an EU country), instead of completing and sending a drawback claim form to the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr>, you simply record the amount of duty drawback in the appropriate field on your EX46 return. You will not have to submit supporting evidence with your return, but you must keep the supporting evidence for the claim for your records and make that evidence available to HMRC on request.</p>

<span class="number">3.5 </span> As a tobacco manufacturer, how does the drawback scheme differ if I am claiming drawback for products returned for recycling, repackaging or destruction?</h3>

<p>If you are a tobacco manufacturer and you are claiming drawback for tobacco products that have been returned to your registered store (within three years of their removal to home use) to be recycled, repackaged or destroyed, you must follow the guidance in Notice 476 Tobacco products duty and consult with your assurance officer to offset the amount of duty drawback on your TP7 return. You must not follow the guidance in this notice.</p>

<p>However, if you are a tobacco manufacturer claiming drawback for tobacco products for reasons other than recycling, repackaging or destroying returned goods, follow the guidance in this notice to claim drawback using the standard procedure outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#dra-work">paragraph 3.3</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> As a brewer, wine producer or cider maker, how does the drawback scheme differ if I wish to claim drawback for spoilt product?</h3>

<p>If you are claiming drawback for goods that will be destroyed as they have become spoilt or otherwise unfit for use and you are a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered cider or perry maker</li>
  <li>licensed wine or made-wine producer</li>
  <li>registered brewer or registered holder</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span> Additional conditions that can be imposed</h3>

<p>We can impose specific conditions on your business and claims. We will notify you of these in writing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span> Definition of ‘eligible goods’ for drawback purposes</h3>

<p>Goods are eligible goods for drawback purposes if the UK excise duty has been paid (and has not been remitted, repaid or drawn back), and those goods have been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exported outside the UK (or dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country)</li>
  <li>warehoused for export</li>
  <li>destroyed</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>warehousing for export does not apply to alcoholic drinks charged with duty under ALDA (for example spirits, beer, wine, cider, alcopops and so on)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chewing tobacco and tobacco for heating are not an eligible product for drawback when dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country (or to the test of the UK) – otherwise drawback claims may be made in respect of these goods</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>goods removed to the Isle of Man are not eligible goods due to the common duty system operated between the UK and the Isle of Man.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span> Definition of ‘eligible claimant’ for drawback purposes</h3>

<p>You are an eligible claimant for drawback purposes if you are a ‘revenue trader’ and you dispatch, export, warehouse or destroy excise goods in the course of your business.</p>

<p>The eligible claimant when goods are exported (or dispatched from Northern Ireland to an EU country) is normally the owner of the goods immediately prior to the dispatch or export transaction.</p>

<p>We do not accept claims from private individuals.</p>

<p>Where eligible goods are being destroyed, the eligible claimant must normally be the person who originally paid the excise duty on those goods  (refer to <a class="govuk-link" href="#before-destroying">paragraphs 9.2 and 9.7</a>) and the nature of the eligible claimant’s business must not be wholly or mainly the destruction of duty paid excise goods.</p>

<p>If you are a registered cider or perry maker, a licensed wine or made-wine producer, or a registered brewer or registered holder and want to claim drawback for the destruction of spoilt goods, you must read <a class="govuk-link" href="#spoilt-product">paragraph 3.7</a> to establish if you are an eligible claimant for drawback as described in this notice or whether another procedure applies, such as arrangements described in Notice 162 Cider Productions, Notice 163 Wine Production or Notice 226 Beer Duty.</p>

<p>If you are a tobacco manufacturer and you are claiming drawback for tobacco products that have been returned to your registered store to be recycled, repackaged or destroyed, you must also read <a class="govuk-link" href="#rec-recycling">paragraph 3.5</a> to establish if you are an eligible claimant for drawback or if another procedure applies.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.5 </span> Actions required if goods carry fiscal marks or duty stamps</h3>

<p>Before you can claim drawback on tobacco products bearing fiscal marks you must first destroy or permanently obliterate the fiscal marks. You can find out more information about fiscal marks in Notice 476 Tobacco Products Duty.</p>

<p>Before you can claim drawback on spirits bearing duty stamps you must first obliterate the duty stamps in accordance with the Duty Stamps Regulations (unless you are a Registered Mobile Operator). Note that at least 2 clear business days notice is required before you obliterate the stamps. You can find out more information about duty stamps in Notice DS5 UK Duty Stamps Scheme.</p>

<p>However, there is an exception to the need to obliterate where goods are exported to the Republic of Ireland as part of a continuous journey from Great Britain to Northern Ireland (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#eleven-two">paragraph 11.2</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.6 </span> Person classed as the ‘original duty payer’ of excise goods</h3>

<p>You are the original duty payer if you originally paid the excise duty for the goods on your drawback claim.</p>

<p>This normally means that you declared and paid the duty to HMRC at the duty point. However, you could still be classed as the original duty payer if your money or your deferment account is used by a third party to pay the duty. For example, where a warehousekeeper or importer (as part of the service they provide to you) submits the appropriate HMRC duty payment document but quotes your deferment account number.</p>

<p>It is also possible that you could be classed as the original duty payer if the excise duty was paid using a third party’s money or deferment account. To qualify, the third party must have originally paid the duty to HMRC on your behalf and billed you for the excise duty as a separate item on the invoice issued to you for the service they provided, which you then paid.</p>

<p>You would not normally be considered to be the original duty payer if you simply buy duty paid goods from a supplier (this includes suppliers who are also warehousekeepers), even if the duty element of the overall cost is itemised separately on your invoice. In this case the original duty payer would be the person who actually first paid the duty to HMRC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.7 </span> I am the original duty payer of the goods on my drawback claim - evidence of UK duty payment need</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. This paragraph imposes additional requirements with which you must comply as a condition of receiving drawback.</p>

<p>As the original duty payer, you must submit the original duty payment document. This can be either the original document or a copy of it.</p>

<p>By ‘original duty payment document’ we mean one of the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>HM2, HM4, TRC2</li>
  <li>EX46, EX606</li>
  <li>TP7</li>
  <li>HO73, HO74, HO75</li>
  <li>HO930, C and E930A, HO101</li>
  <li>print out of <abbr title="Customs Handling of Import &amp; Export Freight">CHIEF</abbr> customs import declaration</li>
  <li>duty deferment statement</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.8 </span> I am not the original duty payer of the goods on my drawback claim - evidence of UK duty payment need</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular this paragraph imposes additional requirements with which you must comply as a condition of receiving drawback.
If you are not the original duty payer, you must provide evidence that clearly shows the goods on your drawback claim are UK duty paid and provide a clear audit trail between those goods and the original duty payment document.</p>

<p>You will need to gather evidence from the original duty payer or payers and any persons in the supply chain who previously had ownership of the goods on your drawback claim.</p>

<p>You must provide the following evidence, numbered and scheduled in a way that makes it obvious which document relates to which set of goods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a copy of your purchase invoice or invoices for the goods on your drawback claim</li>
  <li>the name and VAT registration number of the business that originally paid the excise duty</li>
  <li>the details of the original duty payment document or documents, including the name of the document and details as follows:
    <ul>

      <li>HM2 - provide the dates covered by the return, the excise accounting ID number and the <abbr title="deferment approval number">DAN</abbr>
</li>
      <li>HM4 - provide the HMRC Authorisation Number and the date received from the ‘HMRC use only’ box</li>
      <li>TRC2 - provide the TRC and TCA reference numbers and the date the goods were received</li>
      <li>EX46 - provide the date of the document and the Brewers Reference Number</li>
      <li>EX606 - provide the period dates and the Unique Reference Number (<abbr title="Unique Reference Number">URN</abbr>)</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In specific cases we can also make it a condition of your claim that you supply supplementary information about markings on the goods, for example batch or lot numbers, date and time of manufacture and so on.</p>

<p>Exceptionally, if you cannot obtain details of the original duty payment document from the original duty payer, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#no-details">paragraph 4.9</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.9 </span> I am not the original duty payer of the goods on my drawback claim – action required if I cannot obtain details of the original duty payment document?</h3>

<p>In exceptional circumstances you might not be able to obtain the details of the original duty payment document from the original duty payer (this information is an essential part of the information requested at paragraph 4.8 that proves UK excise duty payment).</p>

<p>If the original duty payer cannot or will not provide you with the details of the original duty payment document, you can contact the Drawback Central Assurance Team (<abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr>) to ask if alternative evidence can be submitted (known as an alternative evidence agreement).</p>

<p>If you would like to ask for an alternative evidence agreement, write to <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr> including the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence that you have tried to obtain details of the original duty payment document from the original duty payer but this was unsuccessful</li>
  <li>a written declaration on letter headed paper from the original duty payer’s business, signed from an authorised signatory, stating:</li>
  <li>that they cannot or will not provide you (or your intermediary if one exists in the supply chain) with details of original duty payment</li>
  <li>that goods are supplied duty paid</li>
  <li>the type(s) and brand(s) of the goods supplied</li>
</ul>

<p>If <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr> agree your alternative evidence agreement they will confirm this in writing. You can then submit your drawback claim with a copy of the alternative evidence agreement and the other information requested at <a class="govuk-link" href="#orig-dutypayer">paragraph 4.8</a> (the purchase invoice, details of the original duty payer and delivery notes).</p>

<p>Alternative evidence agreements must be agreed before you submit the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form.</p>

<p>An agreed alternative evidence agreement can be used for future drawback claims that involve the same original duty payer, supply chain and products. However, if any component of the alternative evidence agreement changes, the agreement is void and a new agreement must be reached with <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr>. For example, where the written declaration from the original duty payer is valid for a set period of time and that time period has now expired. We will periodically review alternative evidence agreements to check there has been no change.</p>

<p>We will withdraw alternative evidence agreements where we identify non compliance or revenue risks.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.10 </span> Amount of notice to give HMRC before you dispatch, export, warehouse for export or destroy the goods you intend claiming drawback on</h3>

<p>You must give us written notice of your intention to claim drawback before the event giving rise to the claim takes place (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#eve-claim">paragraph 3.2</a>) using the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form, unless the goods have been accidentally destroyed. This gives us the opportunity to inspect the goods and any accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>You must give us at least 2 clear business days notice between the day the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received at the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> and the day the goods will be dispatched, exported, warehoused for export or destroyed. Where goods will be destroyed and they are not held at your business premises, you must give us at least 5 clear business days notice between the day the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received at the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> and the day the goods will be destroyed.</p>

<p>A business day is a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or Bank Holiday.</p>

<p>The day the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received does not count towards the period of notice. For example, if the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received on Monday the period of notice starts on Tuesday.</p>

<p>If the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received by fax or e-mail after 4pm it will be treated as received the following business day. For example, if the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received by fax at 3:45pm on Monday, it is treated as received on Monday and the period of notice starts on Tuesday. However, if the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is received by fax at 4:30pm on Monday, it is treated as received on Tuesday and the period of notice starts on Wednesday.</p>

<p>If you intend to hold the goods only for the minimum period of notice required, or if you posted the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr>, contact the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> by email or fax to confirm when the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> was received so that you can make sure you provide the correct period of notice.</p>

<p>If you remove goods from the inspection address specified in your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> or carry out destructions before the period of notice has expired we will reject your claim.</p>

<p>Period of notice example 1: <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> received by post at the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> on Thursday 1 June:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is treated as received on Thursday 1 June</li>
  <li>the period of notice is two business days - Friday 2 June and Monday 5 June (Saturday and Sunday are not business days)</li>
  <li>the goods can be exported (dispatched if from Northern Ireland to an EU country), or warehoused for export on or after Tuesday 6 June, provided the goods were held at the premises declared on the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> for the period Friday 2 June  to Monday 5 June - this also applies to goods intended for destruction, provided they are held for inspection at your business address</li>
  <li>if the goods to be destroyed are not being held for inspection at your business address you must give us at least 5 clear business days’ notice - in this example, this means that the goods could be destroyed on or after Friday 9 June</li>
</ul>

<p>Period of notice example 2: <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> received by fax at 4:30pm on Thursday 1 June:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> is treated as received on Friday 2 June (the notice was received by fax after 4pm)</li>
  <li>the period of notice is 2 business days - Monday 5 June and Tuesday 6 June (Saturday and Sunday are not business days)</li>
  <li>the goods can be exported (dispatched if from Northern Ireland to an EU country), or warehoused for export on or after Wednesday 7 June, provided the goods were held at the premises declared on the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> for the period Monday 5 June to Tuesday 6 June - this also applies to goods intended for destruction, provided they are held for inspection at your business address</li>
  <li>if the goods to be destroyed are not held for inspection at your business address you must give us at least 5 clear business days’ notice - in this example, this means that the goods could be destroyed on or after 10 June. Although this is a Saturday, the 5 business days’ notice was provided in the period Monday to Friday</li>

<span class="number">4.12 </span> If you need to change the details you submitted in your notice of intention to claim drawback</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular, this paragraph imposes additional requirements with which you must comply as a condition of receiving drawback.</p>

<p>If you find that you need to change any information on your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form after you have submitted it, you must contact the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> by email or fax and tell them about the change in writing.</p>

<p>If the change affects the inspection of the goods (for example the type or quantity of goods, the address where the goods are held for inspection and so on) the period of notice will start again from the business day after the day you advise the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> of the change. The <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> will confirm the start date of the amended period of notice.</p>

<p>If you do not notify us of changes to the information on your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form, or adhere to a revised period of notice, your drawback claim may be reduced or rejected (see section 14 of this notice for more information).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.13 </span> Time limits to claiming drawback</h3>

<p>The event giving rise to the claim for drawback (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#eve-claim">paragraph 3.2</a>) must take place within 3 years of the date the UK excise duty was paid on the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.14 </span> The minimum amount of drawback you can claim</h3>

<p>The minimum amount of drawback you can claim is £500. If your claim is lower than £500 you can wait and submit multiple claim forms at the same time in order to meet the £500 minimum.</p>

<p>If the total amount of drawback you could have claimed in the last 6 months is less than £500 (and you have not submitted a drawback claim during that 6 months) the minimum amount of drawback you can claim becomes £50. So if you have not submitted a drawback claim in the last 6 months and you have a drawback claim or claims that total £50 or more, you can submit the drawback claim or claims.</p>

<span class="number">6.Claiming </span> drawback when dispatching goods from Northern Ireland to an EU country</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> What you need to do before dispatching goods from Northern Ireland to an EU country</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 8(2)(b) and (d) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr> (as they will apply in Northern Ireland). In particular, this paragraph sets out the pre-export declarations and other requirements that must be completed and made available for inspection before you export goods on which you intend to later claim drawback.</p>

<p>When you intend to dispatch goods from Northern Ireland to a business in an EU country and claim drawback of the excise duty, you must before the goods are dispatched:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete form <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> (the form that must accompany duty paid goods as they move between Northern Ireland and the  EU) or a commercial equivalent containing the same information and bearing the statement ‘Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document (Excise goods) for fiscal control purposes’</li>
  <li>if the claim includes alcoholic or tobacco products that bear fiscal marks or duty stamps, destroy or permanently obliterate the fiscal marks or duty stamps (however, see <a class="govuk-link" href="#eleven-two">paragraph 11.2</a>)</li>
  <li>secure the excise duty in the EU country of destination to the satisfaction of the fiscal authorities in that country or hold evidence that duty is not payable on the goods in the EU country of destination (we also recommend that a document showing that the duty has been secured in the EU country of destination accompanies the goods)</li>
  <li>complete and submit form <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr>, and</li>
  <li>hold the goods for at least the relevant period of notice in case we decide to inspect the goods and the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The recipient of the goods will normally guarantee or secure the duty but you could do this instead if the fiscal authority in the EU country of destination allows you to do so. If you are not sure of the requirements in the EU country of destination we suggest that you discuss this with your customer, your customer’s agent or the fiscal authority in the EU country of destination.</p>

<p>When you move UK duty paid goods to an EU country, you must also make sure that you comply with any statutory VAT obligations that may arise in the receiving EU country as a result.</p>

<p>It is in your interest to check that you will be an eligible claimant and that the goods will be eligible goods. It is also in your interest to check that you will be within the time limit to claim drawback.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot move UK duty paid goods directly for storage in a duty suspended tax warehouse in an EU country.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> When you can dispatch the goods</h3>

<p>You can dispatch the goods once you have completed the actions listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#ni-eu">paragraph 6.1</a> and after the relevant period of notice has ended.</p>

<p>If you remove goods from the inspection address specified in your <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> before the period of notice has expired we will reject your claim.</p>

<p>You must exercise control over the delivery of the goods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> When you can submit the claim for drawback (or offset the drawback on your EX46 return)</h3>

<p>You can submit your drawback claim form, or offset the drawback on your EX46 return, when the goods have been received in the EU country of destination and you have all the supporting evidence required (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#submit-form">paragraph 6.4</a>).</p>

<p>You must also make sure that the claim or claims being submitted comply with the time limit and the minimum monetary limit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Supporting evidence you need to submit with your drawback claim form</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 10 of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr> (as they will apply in Northern Ireland). In particular, this paragraph sets out the documentary evidence of export you must include with your claim for drawback after export.</p>

<p>You must provide the following documents with your completed drawback form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of UK duty payment</li>
  <li>the endorsed copy 3 of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> (or commercial equivalent) with the information in section B ‘Certification of Receipt’ fully completed by the recipient</li>
  <li>evidence showing that duty is chargeable and has been collected in the EU country of destination (such as the duty accounting document, issued by the fiscal authority in that country) or confirmation that the goods are not liable to excise duty in that country</li>
  <li>if the claim includes alcoholic goods subject to duty stamps, a copy of the notification of obliteration sent to the Duty Stamps team plus an extract from your records showing the details of the stamps that were obliterated (subject to <a class="govuk-link" href="#fiscal-marks">paragraph 4.5</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a brewer offsetting the drawback on your EX46 return, you do not need to submit these documents to the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> but you must keep them for your records for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span> Special arrangements that apply when you dispatch goods from Northern Ireland to a private individual in an EU country (also known as ‘Distance Selling’)</h3>

<p>If you dispatch UK duty paid excise goods from Northern Ireland to private individuals in an EU country (known as Distance Selling), you must still follow the process outlined in this section 6.</p>

<p>However, if you frequently dispatch small packages to private individuals in EU countries, we might be able to ease some of the requirements for these transactions. We might be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>waive the requirement to submit the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> and provide the period of notice (due to the small size of the packages and the high frequency of the movements) and instead require you to provide a schedule with your drawback claim that lists all the transactions included in that claim and provides the same information as requested on the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr>
</li>
  <li>waive the requirement to submit orders and invoices with your drawback claim (you still need to keep these documents and make then readily available)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, except for the copy of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>, you still need to provide the rest of the supporting evidence requested in <a class="govuk-link" href="#submit-form">paragraph 6.4</a> for each of the transactions included in your drawback claim. As the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> is not used for Distance Sales you will need to provide other evidence and details to prove the goods were dispatched.</p>

<p>If you frequently dispatch small packages to private individuals in EU countries and you would like to use these Distance Selling easements when claiming drawback, contact <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr> who will consider if an agreement is suitable for you. Note that an agreement to use Distance Selling easements must be made with <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr> before you start to use the easements.</p>

<p>Warehousing for export does not apply to alcoholic drinks charged with duty under ALDA (for example spirits, beer, wine, cider, alcopops and so on). Therefore, for example, you cannot place duty paid beer in an excise warehouse and reclaim the duty under warehousing for export arrangements.</p>

  <li>complete and submit form Notice of Intention (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#requirements-eleven">paragraph 4.11</a>)</li>
  <li>hold the goods and the warehousing advice note for at least the relevant period of notice in case we decide to inspect the goods and the warehousing advice note</li>
</ul>

<p>It is in your interest to check that you will be an eligible claimant and that the goods will be eligible goods. Warehousing for export does not apply to alcoholic drinks charged with duty under ALDA (for example spirits, beer, wine, cider, alcopops and so on).</p>

<p>It is also in your interest to check that you will be within the time limit to claim drawback.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> Condition of goods subject to a planned destruction claim</h3>

<p>For you to claim drawback for planned destructions, the quality of the goods must be unsatisfactory due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>faulty manufacture</li>
  <li>deterioration</li>
  <li>contamination</li>
</ul>

<p>See section 14 of the Sales of Goods Act 1979 for a definition of ‘satisfactory quality’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> What you need to do before destroying goods</h3>

<p>When you intend to destroy goods that are of an unsatisfactory quality, you must before the goods are destroyed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complete and submit the Notice of Intention form</li>
  <li>hold the goods for at least the relevant period of notice in case we decide to inspect the goods (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#notice-dispatch">paragraph 4.10</a> to check which period of notice applies)</li>
</ul>

<p>Destruction normally takes place at the address where the goods are available for inspection, however we can permit goods to be destroyed at another UK address such as an independent destruction premises. If we decide that your proposed place of destruction is not satisfactory we will tell you in writing.</p>

<p>It is in your interest to check that you will be an eligible claimant and that the goods will be eligible goods. It is also in your interest to check that you will be within the time limit to claim drawback. To be an eligible claimant you should normally be the original duty payer, if you are not and intend to exceptionally make a claim, you must provide the information described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section97-evidence">paragraph 9.7</a> when submitting your completed claim form.</p>

<p>If you are a registered cider or perry maker, a licensed wine or made-wine producer, or a registered brewer or registered holder and you are claiming drawback for the destruction of spoilt goods, you must also read <a class="govuk-link" href="#spoilt-product">paragraph 3.7</a> to establish if you are an eligible claimant for drawback as described in this notice, or if another procedure applies, such as arrangements described in Notice 162 Cider Production,Notice 163 Wine Production or Notice 226 Beer Duty.</p>

<p>To be a suitable destruction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>alcohol must be denatured by adding a substance that makes it unfit for drinking</li>
  <li>tobacco must be destroyed or rendered unsmokeable by incineration, grinding or denaturing (see Notice 476 Tobacco Products Duty), and</li>
  <li>energy products must be destroyed in a non chargeable way, for example useful heat can not be produced (see Notice 179 Motor and Heating Fuels: General information and accounting for excise duty and VAT).</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">10.Claiming </span> drawback in cases of accidental destruction</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> The circumstances when you can claim drawback following the accidental destruction of goods</h3>

<p>It is your responsibility to protect your goods by insuring them against normal risks. We will only consider claims for goods that were destroyed accidentally, (as opposed to goods that were destroyed following the planned destruction procedure described in this notice), for the following reasons where you can show that your insurance does not cover the duty liability of the goods that were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accidentally destroyed whilst being removed to a warehouse for export</li>
  <li>being exported or dispatched and were accidentally destroyed in the United Kingdom after leaving the premises at which they were available for inspection</li>
  <li>destroyed by, or as a result of:</li>
  <li>riot</li>
  <li>terrorism</li>
  <li>war</li>
  <li>explosion</li>
  <li>earthquake</li>
  <li>any other fortuitous event that in our opinion it would not have been reasonable to insure the goods against</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> How to report an accidental destruction</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular, it contains requirements that you must comply with as a condition of your claim for drawback.</p>

<p>You must email or fax the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> at the earliest opportunity to report the accidental destruction in writing. You will need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name, address, VAT registration number, phone and fax numbers</li>
  <li>the nature of your business</li>
  <li>the name, address and VAT registration number of the person who supplied the goods to you</li>
  <li>the name, address and VAT registration number of your customer, if relevant</li>
  <li>a description of the goods, including whether they were packaged or in bulk</li>
  <li>the amount of duty paid or a provisional estimate if that cannot be immediately ascertained</li>
  <li>if a drawback claim had been initiated, the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> reference number, and</li>
  <li>details of the destruction including the time and place</li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to satisfy us that the goods have not been and will not be consumed in the UK. Any undue delay in reporting the accidental destruction could result in your claim being rejected or reduced.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> How to make the claim for drawback</h3>

<p>When you have notified the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> of the accidental destruction and provided all the information requested in <a class="govuk-link" href="#rreport-accident">paragraph 10.2</a> the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> will send you a claim form.</p>

<p>You can submit your claim for the actual amount of UK duty paid on the goods when you have all the supporting evidence required (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#ten-four">paragraph 10.4</a>).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> The supporting evidence you need to submit with your drawback claim form</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have the force of law under section 133 of CEMA and regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular, it specifies what must be included with your claim for drawback and imposes additional conditions which you must comply with as a condition of your claim for drawback.</p>

<p>You must provide the following documents with your completed drawback form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of UK duty payment</li>
  <li>evidence that the duty you are seeking to recover is outside the scope of normal insurance cover</li>
  <li>evidence that you took adequate measures to safeguard the goods before and after the accident, and</li>
  <li>evidence that your claim is genuine, for example</li>
  <li>copies of police reports</li>
  <li>statements from witnesses (for example the driver, security personnel, onlookers, third parties and so on)</li>
  <li>correspondence with insurance companies (for example insurance assessor’s reports)</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">11.Claims </span> for goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> When a drawback claim can be made</h3>

<p>In most cases duty paid excise goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain or the Isle of Man are not eligible goods for the purpose of drawback. This is because those goods will be consumed in the UK therefore UK excise duty remains due on those goods and it does not matter in which part of the UK this was paid.</p>

<p>However, where duty paid goods travel from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but their journey takes them through the EU, then a drawback claim may be made. This is because those goods will be exported from Great Britain to the EU before their onward journey to Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Differences from a normal export</h3>

<p>This paragraph contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 10 of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular, the documentary evidence required to support a claim.</p>

<p>If the goods are directly consigned from Great Britain to an address in an EU country, then this is a normal export. This means that you should follow the procedures and evidential requirements as described in section 7 of this notice.</p>

<p>If the goods are directly consigned from Great Britain to an address in Northern Ireland but merely pass through an EU country, in most cases the procedures and evidential requirements to follow will be those that apply to a normal export. This includes obliteration of any duty stamps, so new duty stamps would need to be applied in Northern Ireland, following the duty stamps requirements in Notice DS5 UK Duty Stamps Scheme.</p>

<p>However, where UK duty stamped goods which are intended for retail sale in Northern Ireland only pass through the Republic of Ireland on their journey, it is possible to retain the stamps on the goods to avoid the need to reapply them. In order to do so you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure that Irish excise duty is paid immediately upon import to the Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>ensure that the goods move from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland under cover of a duty paid scheme recognised under EU law</li>
  <li>UK excise duty is paid upon arrival in Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>In such cases, in addition to the evidential requirements for a normal export, we will require proof of UK excise duty payment in Northern Ireland before the drawback claim submitted in Great Britain can be paid. This is to reduce the risk of goods bearing legitimate UK duty stamps finding their way onto the UK market without payment of UK excise duty. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-four">section 4</a> of this notice for examples of acceptable evidence of payment of UK excise duty.</p>

<span class="number">12.Transitional </span> arrangements for goods supplied to the EU where the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form is submitted before 11pm on 31 December 2020 but the claim is made after this date</h2>

<p>This section contains requirements that have force of law under regulation 5(2) of the Excise Duties (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and regulation 7(1) of the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>. In particular this section will affect your legal obligations, where it either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provides for documents to be used, in certain circumstances, and on certain conditions, instead of the documents prescribed in the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>relieves a condition imposed by the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>
</li>
  <li>imposes an additional condition not mentioned in the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span> What the transitional arrangements are and when they apply</h3>

<p>This section sets out the transitional arrangements for drawback claims for UK duty paid goods supplied to the EU when the <abbr title="Notice of intention">NOI</abbr> form (EX75) is provided to HMRC before the transition period related to the UK leaving the EU ends at 11pm on 31 December 2020 but the dispatch or the claim (EX76) is made after this date. It sets out important information about the procedure you will need to follow to claim drawback in these circumstances, including the evidence you will need to support your drawback claim for these supplies.</p>

<p>They only apply to goods that are being held in, and are therefore being dispatched from, a business address in Great Britain, not Northern Ireland. This is because EU exit does not affect the evidential requirements for goods exported from Northern Ireland to the EU are not affected by the UK leaving the EU. Those are covered in section 6 of this notice.</p>

<p>Transitional provisions for exports to non-EU countries are in section 7.6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span> The supporting evidence you must submit with your EX76 claim if the Notice of Intention form is submitted before the end of the transitional period but the goods are dispatched after this date</h3>

<p>If you submit the form before the end of the transitional period, but send the goods from Great Britain to the EU after this date, then when you make your claim on form EX76 you must include the supporting evidence described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7">section 7</a> of this notice  instead of the documents required by the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>  in the form it had before the end of the transition period.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span> The supporting evidence you must submit with your EX76 claim when the goods are dispatched to the EU before the end of the transition period but the claim is made after this date</h3>

<p>Where goods are dispatched to an EU country before the end of the transitional period but the claim is made after this date, you should provide all of the following documents with your completed drawback claim form EX76, instead of the documents required by the <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr>  (in the form it had before the end of the transition period):</p>

<ul>
  <li>evidence of UK duty payment</li>
  <li>the endorsed copy 3 of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> (or commercial equivalent) with the information in section B ‘Certification of Receipt’ fully completed by the recipient – the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> is the Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document, which must accompany duty paid goods as they move within the EU as per EU Council Regulation 3649/92</li>
  <li>evidence showing that duty is chargeable and has been collected in the EU country of destination (such as the duty accounting document, issued by the fiscal authority in that country) or confirmation that the goods are not liable to excise duty in that country</li>
  <li>if the claim includes alcoholic goods subject to duty stamps, a copy of the notification of obliteration sent to the Duty Stamps team plus an extract from your records showing the details of the stamps that were obliterated</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unable to obtain a receipted <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> from your customer, or are unable to obtain evidence duty payment in the EU country of destination, you may submit alternative evidence showing removal of the goods from the UK.</p>

<p>Your evidence must, when viewed as a whole, sufficiently demonstrate that the goods are no longer in the UK. We will only make a drawback refund where we are satisfied that this is the case, and all other conditions of drawback are met.</p>

<p>Copies of transport documents alone will not normally be sufficient, and will need to be supplemented by other commercial evidence that provides all of the following detail:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the supplier</li>
  <li>the consignor (where different from the supplier)</li>
  <li>the customer</li>
  <li>the export destination</li>
  <li>the mode of transport and route of the export movement</li>
  <li>an accurate description of the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence could for example, include a number of the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commercial transport documents from the carrier responsible for removing the goods from the UK, for example:</li>
  <li>authenticated sea waybills</li>
  <li>authenticated air waybills</li>
  <li>PIM/PIEX International consignment notes</li>
  <li>master air waybills or bills of lading</li>
  <li>certificates of shipment containing the full details of the consignment and how it left the UK</li>
  <li>International Consignment Note/Lettre de Voiture International (CMR) fully completed by the consignor, the haulier and the receiving consignee, or Freight Transport Association own account transport documents fully completed and signed by the receiving customer</li>
  <li>details of insurance or freight charges</li>
  <li>customer order forms</li>
  <li>invoices and receipts</li>
  <li>bank statements as evidence of payment</li>
  <li>receipted copy of the consignment note as evidence of receipt of goods abroad</li>
  <li>any other documents relevant to the removal of the goods in question, which you would normally get in the course of your intra-EU business</li>
</ul>

<p>Photocopy certificates of shipment or other transport documents are not normally acceptable as evidence of removal unless authenticated with an original stamp and dated by an authorised official of the issuing office. If the evidence is found to be unsatisfactory then your drawback claim will not be accepted.</p>

<p>If you are a brewer offsetting the drawback on your EX46 return, you do not need to submit these documents to the <abbr title="Drawback Processing Centre">DPC</abbr> but you must keep them for your records for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span> The supporting evidence you need with your drawback claim, made after 1 January 2021 for goods sent to private individuals in the EU under distance selling arrangements before this date</h3>

<p>You will need to provide the information in<a class="govuk-link" href="#section-twelve"> paragraph 12.3</a> of this notice with the exception of the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr>. This is because the <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> was not required for this type of supply. Instead of an <abbr title="Simplified Administrative Accompanying Document">SAAD</abbr> you should provide other evidence to show that the goods were sent. This could include a copy of the original order, proof of postage and evidence of payment of the duty in the EU country of destination under distance selling rules.</p>

<p>If you have previously been granted a distance selling easement arrangement by <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr>, you should provide a schedule with your drawback claim listing all the transactions sent before the UK left the EU and to which your claim relates. You do not need to submit copies of orders or invoices with your claim, but you should keep these records and make them available should we wish to see them.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.5 </span> The supporting evidence you need with your drawback claim, made after 1 January 2021 for some goods sent to EU private individuals before this date and some goods sent after this date</h3>

<p>For goods sent to private individuals in the EU before the end of the transitional period you should provide the documents described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#twelve-four">paragraph 12.4</a>.</p>

<p>For goods sent to private individuals in the EU after the end of the transitional period you should provide the documents described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-7">section 7</a> of this notice. This includes completing form C&amp;E132 ‘Certificate of posting of goods delivered from a Customs and Excise postal depot or from an exporter’s premises for exportation by post’ (an international customs declaration available from the Post Office) and label each package with form C&amp;E83A.</p>

<p>If you have previously been granted a distance selling easement arrangement by <abbr title="Drawback Central Assurance Team">DCAT</abbr>, you should provide a schedule with your drawback claim listing all the transactions to which your claim relates. Your schedule should specifically identify those transactions for goods sent before the end of the transitional period and those sent after this date. You do not need to submit copies of orders or invoices with your claim, but you should keep these records and make them available should we wish to see them.</p>

<span class="number">13.Payment </span> of claims</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span> How much duty will be repaid</h3>

<p>We will repay the amount of UK excise duty originally paid subject to all the conditions and requirements in this notice and <abbr title="Excise Goods (Drawback) Regulations 1995">EGDR</abbr> being met.</p>

<h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.2 </span> How HMRC will carry out visits</h3>

<p>We will normally make an appointment. Occasionally visits are made without an appointment but the attending officer will give the reason for the unannounced visit. All our officers carry identification and will show this when they arrive.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.3 </span> Responsiblity for the safety of HMRC personnel</h3>

<p>While our officers are on your premises you must make sure their safety at all times.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.4 </span> What you can expect from HMRC</h3>

<p>You can expect that we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify ourselves by name on arrival, and produce an identity card</li>
  <li>explain the main purpose of the visit</li>
  <li>be polite and considerate and deal with your tax affairs confidentially</li>
  <li>keep demands on you and your staff’s time to a minimum, and</li>
  <li>where possible, try to resolve matters during the visit</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.5 </span> How you can help HMRC</h3>

<p>You can help by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keeping your records up to date</li>
  <li>providing us with the information and explanations we request, and</li>
  <li>helping us to understand your business and records</li>
</ul>

<p>During our visit we will wish to see your business records relating to your trading activities, including records for dispatched, exported or destroyed goods.</p>

<p>We could also examine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>profit and loss trading statements</li>
  <li>management accounts and reports</li>
  <li>balance sheets</li>
  <li>internal and external auditors reports, and</li>
  <li>any other record maintained for a business purpose</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">16.6 </span> If you disagree with a decision made by the visiting officer</h3>

<p>If you disagree with a decision, discuss it first with the visiting officer.</p>

<p>If you still disagree you should read <a class="govuk-link" href="#seven-teen">section 17</a> of this notice.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17.Review </span> and appeals process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span> If you disagree with any decision we make about your affairs</h3>

<p>When we make a decision that you can appeal against we will tell you and offer you a review. We will explain the decision and tell you what you need to do if you disagree, for example with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the amount of an assessment</li>
  <li>the issue of a penalty</li>
  <li>a decision specifically connected to a claim for drawback</li>
</ul>

<p>You will usually have 3 options. Within 30 days you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information or arguments to the officer you have been dealing with</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by a different officer</li>
  <li>have your case heard by an independent tribunal</li>
</ul>

<p>A review will be handled by a different officer from the one who made the decision. If you prefer to have an independent tribunal hear your case, you must write directly to the Tribunals Service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span> Time limit to ask for a review</h3>

<p>If you want us to review a decision, you must write to the person who issued the decision letter within 30 days of the date of that letter. We will complete our review within 45 days, unless we agree another time with you.</p>

<p>You cannot ask the tribunal to hear your case until the 45 days (or the time we agreed with you) has expired, or we have told you the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the review’s conclusion, you have 30 days within which to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<p>If we cannot complete our review within 45 days, or any time we agreed with you, we will ask you whether you are willing to agree to an extension so that we can complete the review. If you do not agree to an extension, the review is treated as concluding that the decision being reviewed is upheld. We will write and tell you this; you then have 30 days from the date of that letter to ask the tribunal to hear your case.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span> What you must include in your request for a review</h3>

<p>Your request should set out clearly the full details of your case, the reasons why you disagree with us and provide any supporting documentation. You should also state what result you expect from our review.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span> If you do not want a review</h3>

<p>If you do not want a review you may appeal to the independent tribunal. You need to send your appeal to the Tribunals Service within 30 days of the date on the decision letter.</p>

<h3>
