<p>We also process your data for research and statistical purposes.</p>

<h4>Your rights</h4>

<p>You have the following rights regarding how we use your data.</p>

<p>You have the right to know if we hold data about you, what it is, its source and how we use it. Find out how to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-privacy-policy/dvla-privacy-policy#information-we-hold-about-you">make a request for the data we hold on you</a>.</p>

<p>You have the right to complain to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/" rel="external">Information Commissioner</a> if you believe that we have handled your data inappropriately or we have not exercised any of your rights.</p>

<p>If you believe that the data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct it without undue delay. We may need to investigate further to confirm that this is the case.</p>

<p>You have the right to have your data erased where there is no need for us to carry on holding it. However, where we have a legal right or obligation to hold your personal data, this right will not apply.</p>

<p>You have the right to have the processing of your personal information restricted where it is inaccurate or where the processing is unlawful.</p>

<p>You have the right not to be subject to decisions which have a legal or significant effect based solely on ‘automated processing’. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automatic individual decision-making (a decision is made solely by automated means without any human involvement)</li>
  <li>profiling (personal data is processed automatically to evaluate certain things about an individual); profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process</li>
</ul>

<p>You have the right to object to us processing your personal data in any of the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when it is based on ‘legitimate interests’ - this is when the processing is necessary for the controller’s or third party’s legitimate interests, except where these interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which protect your personal data</li>
  <li>when it is based on the ‘public task condition’ - this means carrying out a specific task in the public interest which is laid down by law, or carrying out official authority (for example, a public body’s tasks, functions, duties or powers) which is laid down by law</li>
  <li>direct marketing (including profiling)</li>
  <li>scientific or historical research and statistics purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The following rights do not apply where processing is based on a legal obligation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the right to object to processing</li>
  <li>the right to data portability, which allows individuals to get and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services</li>
  <li>the right to withdraw consent</li>
</ul>

<p>These rights are explained fully on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ico.org.uk/" rel="external">Information Commissioner’s Office</a> website.</p>

<p>We will consider any request you make to us to exercise these rights within the timescales required by data protection law.</p>

<h4>How long we keep information about you</h4>

<p>How long we keep your information will depend on why we collected it and our ongoing need to keep it for those purposes. We will also adhere to any legal or regulatory requirements for keeping or deleting the data.</p>

<p>If we cannot specify how long we will need the data for, there will be a process in place to review this need at regular intervals.</p>

<h4>Who we may share personal information with</h4>

<p>Where it is lawful to do so, we may share your personal information with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>current and prospective employers</li>
  <li>other government departments</li>
  <li>suppliers</li>
  <li>debt collection, tracing, and ID verification agencies</li>

<p>We share information with a third party fraud prevention agency to prevent fraud and protect your identity. Where we detect a fraudulent application for a driving licence or vehicle registration certificate, the fraud protection agency will keep a record of any fraud risk and this may result in others refusing to provide you with services, financing or employment. Find out more on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn" rel="external">the Cifas website</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>When you apply for a driving licence</h2>

<p>We may collect and process your personal information to allow us to carry out our legal obligations under the following legislation.</p>

<h4>Road Traffic Act 1988</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To issue provisional and full driving licences, replace lost licences, update licences with amended personal details or driving entitlement, and renew licences if you are disqualified from driving or your driving entitlement expires.</li>
  <li>To record and enable the investigation of medical conditions that may affect your fitness to drive.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988/Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To record details of road traffic disqualifications and convictions.</li>
  <li>To administer driving entitlement revocation where required by this legislation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>We are also obliged by law to record details of non-driving offences that lead to being disqualified from driving.</p>

<h4>Who we share your driver data with</h4>

<p>We may share information from your driving licence record with third parties where necessary, and when the law allows it. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/release-of-information-from-dvlas-registers">Find out more</a> about the release of information from DVLA’s registers.</p>

<p>If you have authorised us to release information provided to us during the course of a medical investigation, we may share any supporting documents (including medical reports) where necessary with doctors, optometrists or other eye care professionals, paramedical staff, driving assessors, occupational therapists and members of the Department for Transport’s Medical Advisory Panels. We only share the minimum data needed to assess your medical fitness to drive. If you do not provide us with the required authorisation, you could lose your driving entitlement.</p>

<p>We capture data on behalf of NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) when you specify on your driving licence application that you wish to become an organ donor. We share this information with NHSBT and provide them with change of address details. This information is recorded by means of a code on your driving licence. If you no longer wish to be an organ donor you should contact NHSBT to remove your details from their records, and return your driving licence to us to have the code removed and a new licence issued.</p>

<h4>Who provides us with information about you</h4>

<p>The following organisations may give us information about you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the courts tell us when a driver has been convicted of a driving offence or disqualification and are also legally bound to tell us about any medical conditions disclosed during the court case</li>
  <li>Traffic Commissioners provide outcomes of large goods vehicle (LGV) and passenger carrying vehicle (PCV) driver conduct cases</li>
  <li>the police and other third parties (such as members of the public) may tell us if they are concerned about someone’s fitness to drive</li>
  <li>your GP, specialist or consultant may provide us with information about a notifiable medical condition which may affect your fitness to drive; this is required for us to be able to check you meet the current legal standards to drive</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why you must provide your personal data</h4>

<p>By law, drivers must provide their personal information to get a driving licence. It is an offence not to tell us about a change in personal details or about a medical condition that may affect your fitness to drive, or to drive a vehicle without the required driving entitlement. If you do not comply with these requirements, you could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>When you notify us online, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving">about a medical condition that could affect your fitness to drive</a>, there is an element of automated processing within the service. This process gives a recommendation, to a person dealing with your notification, on the next steps to take in your case.</p>

<p>When you use any of our online services or send in a DVLA form in relation to your driving licence, you have the option of providing your telephone number and email address. This information will only be used to contact you about these matters.</p>

<h4>Changes to HGV and bus driving licences</h4>

<p>From 15 November 2021 there will be a change to HGV and bus driving licences and tests. This means that when you view your driving licence on a DVLA online service such as View your Driving Licence Information, you may notice different driving entitlements shown on your licence. For further information on this change, please visit  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/changes-to-hgv-and-bus-driving-tests-and-allowing-car-drivers-to-tow-a-trailer-without-an-extra-test/changes-to-hgv-and-bus-driving-tests-and-allowing-car-drivers-to-tow-a-trailer-without-an-extra-test">Changes to HGV and bus driving licences and tests from 15 November 2021</a>.</p>
