<span class="number">1. </span> Rule requirement:</h3>

<h4>For more sustainable digital programmes and projects:</h4>

<p>1.1 Follow guidance on buying sustainable products.</p>

<p>1.2 Carry out a sustainability appraisal to identify environmental, social, and economic risks and opportunities as early as possible in the project, including ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce resource consumption of hardware devices and software applications.</p>

<p>1.3 Develop requirements for environmental, social, and economic aspects of the procurement, including reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<p>1.4 Identify opportunities for digital capabilities to deliver wider sustainability benefits to the organisation.</p>

<p>1.5 Ensure the contract has appropriate Key Performance Indicators and targets for sustainability, and these are managed throughout the project.</p>

<p>1.6 Ensure continuous improvement of the service or capability is built into the contract, with incentives for suppliers to deliver more sustainable outcomes.</p>

<p>1.7 Regularly review and update the sustainability appraisal particularly before significant technological change, mid-life improvement or disposal/termination.</p>

<p>1.8 Demand regular service reports on meeting sustainability objectives in relevant Government and Defence strategies. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>progress towards Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 or earlier.</li>
  <li>adopting circular economy principles.</li>
  <li>measures to improve supply chain resilience and transparency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Rationale:</h3>

<p>Creating, operating, and disposing of Information Communications Technology (ICT) uses energy and raw materials that are in short supply and can harm the biosphere, including human life.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Defence (MOD) must comply with all relevant environmental legislation and regulations. It must also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reduce overall resource consumption by ICT hardware and business applications.</li>
  <li>enhance supply chain capacity and robustness.</li>
  <li>improve climate resilience of digital capabilities and enabling infrastructure.</li>
  <li>use digital to deliver sustainability benefits to MOD through robotics, automation, artificial intelligence, and remote working.</li>
  <li>ensure MOD services and suppliers abide by relevant employment, human rights, and business laws.</li>
  <li>create social value across communities in the UK and those it works with overseas.</li>
</ul>
