<h2>What is <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> or coronavirus?</h2>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is caused by a new coronavirus, known as <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. It was first identified in late 2019. It is very infectious and can lead to severe respiratory disease.</p>

<p>Many people who are infected may not have any symptoms or only have mild symptoms. These commonly start with cough, fever, headache and loss of taste or smell.</p>

<p>Some people will feel very tired, have aching muscles, diarrhoea and vomiting, fever and confusion. A small number of people then go on to have severe disease which may require hospitalisation or admission to intensive care.</p>

<p>Overall fewer than 1 in 100 people who are infected will die from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, but in those over 75 years of age this rises to 1 in 10.</p>

<p>There is no cure for <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> although some newly tested treatments do help to reduce the risk of complications.</p>

<h2>About the types of vaccine</h2>

<p>In the UK, there are two types of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine currently approved. Other types of vaccine are expected
to be approved during 2021.</p>

<h2>Who should have the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines</h2>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>), an independent expert group, has recommended that the NHS offers these vaccines first to those at highest risk of catching the infection and of suffering serious complications if they catch the infection.</p>

<p>This includes older adults, frontline health and social care workers, care home residents and staff, and those with certain clinical conditions. When more vaccine becomes available, the vaccines will be offered to other people at risk as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Are you at increased risk from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> infection?</h2>

<p>Coronavirus can affect anyone. If you are an older adult and have a long-term health condition, <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> can be very serious and in some cases fatal.</p>

<p>You should have the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine if you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an adult living or working in a care home for the elderly</li>
  <li>a frontline healthcare worker</li>
  <li>a frontline social care worker</li>
  <li>a carer working in domiciliary care looking after older adults</li>
  <li>aged 65 years and over</li>
  <li>younger adults with long-term clinical conditions (see conditions below)</li>
</ul>

<p>The vaccine will also be offered to adults with conditions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a blood cancer (such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma)</li>
  <li>diabetes</li>
  <li>dementia</li>
  <li>a heart problem</li>
  <li>a chest complaint or breathing difficulties, including bronchitis, emphysema or severe asthma</li>
  <li>a kidney disease</li>
  <li>a liver disease</li>
  <li>lowered immunity due to disease or treatment (such as HIV infection, steroid medication, chemotherapy or radiotherapy)</li>
  <li>rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or psoriasis</li>
  <li>have had an organ transplant</li>
  <li>had a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (<abbr title="transient ischaemic attack">TIA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>a neurological or muscle wasting condition</li>
  <li>a severe or profound learning disability</li>
  <li>a problem with your spleen, example sickle cell disease, or having had your spleen removed</li>
  <li>are seriously overweight (<abbr title="body mass index">BMI</abbr> of 40 and above)</li>
  <li>are severely mentally ill</li>
</ul>

<p>All people who are in the Clinically Extremely Vulnerable group will be eligible for a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine. Whether you are offered the vaccine may depend on the severity of your condition. Your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> can advise on whether you are eligible.</p>

<h2>Those who cannot have the vaccine</h2>

<p>The vaccines do not contain living organisms, and so are safe for people with disorders of the immune system. These people may not respond so well to the vaccine. A very small number of people who are at risk of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cannot have the vaccine – this includes people who have severe allergies.</p>

<p>Women of childbearing age, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should read the <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/" class="govuk-link">detailed information available on NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Will the vaccine protect you?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination will reduce the chance of you suffering from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> disease. It may take a week
or two for your body to build up some protection from the first dose of vaccine.</p>

<p>The vaccine has been shown to be effective and no safety concerns were seen in studies of more than 20,000 people.</p>

<p>Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective – some people may still get <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> despite having a vaccination, but this should be less severe.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<p>Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild and short term, and not everyone gets them. Even if you do have symptoms after the first dose, you still need to have the second dose. Although you should get good protection from the first dose, having the second dose should give you longer lasting protection against the virus.</p>

<p>Very common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection. This tends to be worst
around 1-2 days after the vaccine</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>headache</li>
  <li>general aches, or mild flu like symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Although feeling feverish is not uncommon for 2 to 3 days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate you have <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> or another infection. You can rest and take the normal dose of paracetamol (follow the advice in the packaging) to help you feel better.</p>

<p>Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, call NHS 111.</p>

<p>If you do seek advice from a doctor or nurse, make sure you tell them about your vaccination (show them the vaccination card if possible) so that they can assess you properly.</p>

<p>You can also report suspected side effects to vaccines and medicines online through the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>Do you need the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine if you’ve had the flu vaccine?</h2>

<p>The flu vaccine does not protect you from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. As you are eligible for both vaccines you should have them both, but normally separated by at least a week.</p>

<h2>Can you catch <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> from the vaccine?</h2>

<p>You cannot catch <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> from the vaccine but it is possible to have caught <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and not realise you have the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.</p>

<p>The most important symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the symptoms above, stay at home and arrange to have a test. Further information on symptoms is available on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<p>After you have had the first dose you need to plan to attend your second appointment. You should have a record card and your next appointment should be between 3 and 12 weeks later.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give you good protection, you need the second dose to get longer lasting protection.</p>

<p><strong>Keep your record card safe and make sure you keep your next appointment to get your second dose.</strong></p>

<h2>If you are not well when it is your next appointment</h2>

<p>If you are unwell, it is better to wait until you have recovered to have your vaccine, but you should try to have it as soon as possible. You should not attend a vaccine appointment if you are self-isolating, waiting for a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test or unsure if you are fit and well.</p>

<h2>Can you give <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> to anyone, after having the vaccine?</h2>

<p>The vaccine cannot give you <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> infection, and 2 doses will reduce your chance of becoming seriously ill. We do not yet know whether it will stop you from catching and passing on the virus. So, it is important to follow the guidance in your local area to protect those around you.</p>

<p>To protect yourself and your family, friends and colleagues you still need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practice social distancing</li>
  <li>wear a face mask</li>
  <li>wash your hands carefully and frequently</li>
  <li>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">current guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is spread</h2>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is spread through droplets breathed out from the nose or mouth, particularly when speaking or coughing. It can also be picked up by touching your eyes, nose and mouth after contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Please read the product information leaflet for more details on your vaccine, including possible side effects, on the  <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">Coronavirus Yellow Card</a> website. You can also report suspected side effects on the same website or by downloading the Yellow Card app.</p>
