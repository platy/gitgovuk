<p>This leaflet explains phase 2 of the coronavirus (<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>) vaccination programme, who is eligible and who needs to have the vaccine to protect them from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<h2>What is <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> or coronavirus?</h2>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is caused by a new coronavirus, known as <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>. It was first identified in late 2019. It is very infectious and can lead to severe respiratory disease.</p>

<p>Many people who are infected may not have any symptoms or only have mild symptoms. These commonly start with cough, fever, headache and loss of taste or smell.</p>

<p>Some people will feel very tired, have aching muscles, diarrhoea and vomiting, fever and confusion. A small number of people then go on to have severe disease which may require hospitalisation or admission to intensive care.</p>

<p>Overall fewer than 1 in 100 people who are infected will die from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, but in those over 75 years of age this rises to 1 in 10.</p>

<p>There is no cure for <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> although some newly tested treatments do help to reduce the risk of complications.</p>

<h2>About the types of vaccine</h2>

<p>In the UK several different types of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines will be used during 2021. The vaccines will only be approved on the basis of large studies of safety and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Over 30 million people in the UK have been vaccinated against <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and the vaccine has already prevented many cases and more than 6,000 deaths from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>Recently there have been reports of an extremely rare condition involving blood clots and unusual bleeding after vaccination with AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>). This is being carefully reviewed but the risk factors for this condition are not yet clear. Because of the high risk of complications and death from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>), the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency have concluded that the balance is very much in favour of vaccination.</p>

<h2>Who should have the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines?</h2>

<p>In the first phase of the programme the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>), an independent expert group, has recommended that the NHS offers these vaccines first to those at highest risk of catching the infection and of suffering serious complications if they catch the infection.</p>

<p>This includes older adults, frontline health and social care workers, care home residents and staff, and those with certain clinical conditions.</p>

<h2>Are you at increased risk from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> infection?</h2>

<p>Coronavirus can affect anyone. If you are an older adult and have a long-term health condition, you should have already been offered the vaccine.</p>

<h2>Who is now eligible for the vaccination?</h2>

<p>The vaccine is now being offered to people at lower risk from the complications of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>. You are still at risk of catching the infection and passing it on to others.</p>

<p>For most younger people <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is usually a milder illness that rarely leads to complications. For a few people the symptoms may last for longer than the usual 2 to 3 weeks. The vaccination will help to protect you against <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>In the second phase of the programme the vaccine will be offered to those under 50 years old in the following order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>40 to 49 years</li>
  <li>30 to 39 years</li>
  <li>18 years and over</li>
</ul>

<p>The risk remains higher in older ages. For example the risk of dying from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> in someone aged 40 to 49 is 3 times higher than someone in the 30 to 39 year age group and 12 times higher than someone in the 20 to 29 year age group.</p>

<p>Pregnant women should be offered <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines at the same time as people of the same age or risk group. Please read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-women-of-childbearing-age-currently-pregnant-planning-a-pregnancy-or-breastfeeding" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> leaflet for childbearing, pregnant or breastfeeding women</a>.</p>

<p>As the programme progresses, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> will advise on the appropriate vaccine for each age group. The vaccine offered may depend on your age. Currently the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has advised it is preferable for healthy people under 40 to have a vaccine other than <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>. The time when it will be offered will be based on the availability of those vaccines. Anybody who was previously eligible for vaccination remains so and should come forward to start or complete their recommended course.</p>

<h2>Those who cannot have the vaccine</h2>

<p>The vaccines do not contain organisms that grow in the body, and so are safe for people with disorders of the immune system. These people may not respond so well to the vaccine. A very small number of people who are at risk of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> cannot have the vaccine â this includes some people who have severe allergies and people with certain blood disorders.</p>

<h2>Who should wait to have the vaccine?</h2>

<p>If you are currently unwell, self-isolating or waiting for a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test you should delay vaccination until later.</p>

<h2>Will the vaccine protect you?</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination will reduce the chance of you suffering from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> disease. It may take a few weeks for your body to build up some protection from the vaccine.</p>

<p>Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective â some people may still get <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> despite having a vaccination, but this should be less severe.</p>

<p>Further information is available on symptoms on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS.UK</a></p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<p>Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild and short term, and not everyone gets them. Even if you do have symptoms after the first dose, you still need to have the second dose. Although you should get good protection from the first dose, having the second dose should give you longer lasting protection against the virus.</p>

<p>Very common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection. This tends to be worst
around 1 to 2 days after the vaccine</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>headache</li>
  <li>general aches, or mild flu like symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>You can rest and take the normal dose of paracetamol (follow the advice in the packaging) to help you feel better. Although feeling feverish is not uncommon for 2 to 3 days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate you have <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> or another infection.</p>

<p>Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, call NHS 111.</p>

<h4>If you experience any of the following from around 4 days to 4 weeks after vaccination you should seek medical advice urgently:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>a new, severe headache which is not helped by usual painkillers or is getting worse</li>
  <li>an unusual headache which seems worse when lying down or bending over or may be accompanied by:
    <ul>
      <li>blurred vision, nausea and vomiting</li>
      <li>difficulty with your speech</li>
      <li>weakness, drowsiness or seizures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>new, unexplained pinprick bruising or bleeding</li>
  <li>shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any of the above symptoms after your first vaccination, you should speak to your doctor or specialist before having the second dose.</p>

<p>If you do seek advice from a doctor or nurse, make sure you tell them about your vaccination (show them the vaccination card if possible) so that they can assess you properly.</p>

<p>You can also report suspected side effects to vaccines and medicines online through the <a href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<h4>If you are currently in the clinically extremely vulnerable group, please continue to follow the government guidance.</h4>

<h2>What can I do after I have had the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine?</h2>

<p>The vaccine cannot give you <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> infection, and 2 doses will reduce your chance of becoming seriously ill. We do not yet know how much it will reduce the chance of you catching and passing on the virus. So, it is important to continue to protect those around you.</p>

<p>Remember to protect yourself and your family, friends and colleagues you MUST still follow any national or local restrictions and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practise social distancing</li>
  <li>wear a face mask</li>
  <li>wash your hands regularly</li>
  <li>open windows to let fresh air in</li>
  <li>follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus" class="govuk-link">current guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can you catch <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> from the vaccine?</h2>

<p>You cannot catch <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> from the vaccine but it is possible to have caught <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> and not realise you have the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.</p>

<p>The most important symptoms of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the symptoms above, stay at home and arrange to have a test.</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>

<p>After you have had the first dose you need to plan to attend your second appointment. You should have a record card and your next appointment should be between 3 and 12 weeks later.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give you good protection, you need the second dose to get longer lasting protection.</p>

<p>Keep your record card safe and make sure you keep your next appointment to get your second dose.</p>

<h2>If you are not well when it is your next appointment</h2>

<p>If you are unwell, it is better to wait until you have recovered to have your vaccine, but you should try to have it as soon as possible. You should not attend a vaccine appointment if you are self-isolating, waiting for a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test or within 4 weeks of having a positive <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> test.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is spread?</h2>

<p><abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is spread through droplets breathed out from the nose or mouth, particularly when speaking or coughing. It can also be picked up by touching your eyes, nose and mouth after contact with contaminated objects and surfaces.</p>

<p>You MUST still continue to follow any national or local restrictions and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>practise social distancing</li>
  <li>wear a face mask</li>
  <li>wash your hands regularly</li>
  <li>open windows to let fresh air in</li>
  <li>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">current guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Please read the product information leaflet for more details on your vaccine, including possible side effects, on the  <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus Yellow Card</a> website.
