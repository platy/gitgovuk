<p>This licence is valid for 2 years from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023.</p>

<h2>Legal basis of this licence</h2>

<p>The ‘Secretary of State’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> has issued WML-GL42 (this licence) under the powers in Section 16(1)(j) and (k), and (5), of the ‘1981 Act’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. This licence authorises activities that would otherwise be a criminal offence under Part 1 of the 1981 Act.</p>

<p>This licence covers situations where the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is no other satisfactory solution as regards the species and purposes that this licence covers.</p>

<p>As required by section 16(9) of the 1981 Act, the Secretary of State has consulted with Natural England as to the circumstances in which, in their opinion, general licences may be granted and Natural England has given this advice to the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State may modify or revoke this licence at any time. The Secretary of State will not do so, unless there are good reasons.</p>

<h2>Purpose of this licence</h2>

<p>This licence allows an ‘authorised person’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> to carry out activities in relation to certain species of ‘wild birds’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>, the ‘permitted target species’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, for the purposes of preventing ‘serious damage’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup> to ‘livestock’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>, foodstuffs for livestock, crops, vegetables, fruit, fisheries or inland waters.</p>

<p>If you are an authorised person, and you act in accordance with this licence, you may take the following authorised activities but only for the serious damage purposes shown for each permitted target species in Table 1 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘kill’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup> or take the permitted target species</li>
  <li>take, damage or destroy nests of the permitted target species</li>
  <li>take or destroy eggs of the permitted target species</li>
</ul>

  <li>a court has made an order discharging you absolutely in respect of the wildlife offence</li>
</ul>

<p>You must not use this licence if the Secretary of State has withdrawn your authorisation to use it. Read the section on <a class="govuk-link" href="#enforcement-and-penalties-for-misuse-of-this-licence">enforcement and penalties for misuse of this licence</a>.</p>

<h2>Condition 4. Using this licence on a site of special scientific interest (<abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>)</h2>

<p>This condition applies differently, depending on whether or not you are under a duty by virtue of section 28G of the 1981 Act (a ‘section 28G authority’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">[footnote 13]</a></sup>).</p>

<h3>If you’re a section 28G authority</h3>

<p>You must give Natural England notice of your intention to carry out an activity that you consider is likely to damage the special features of a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>. You must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this before you carry out that activity under this licence</li>
  <li>comply with the further requirements in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/section/28H" rel="external">section 28H of the 1981 Act</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the guide: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-public-body-responsibilities">sites of special scientific interest: public body responsibilities</a> for how to give notice of your proposed activity.</p>

<h3>If you’re not a section 28G authority</h3>

<p>You must only carry out your activity on a ‘<abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>’<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">[footnote 14]</a></sup> if you or the landowner has got written consent from Natural England. This applies where the activity you propose to carry out under this licence is listed on the site’s notification as one that could damage the special features of the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>.</p>

<h2>Advice: record your actions</h2>

<p>We recommend that you make a written record of the actions you take under this licence as soon as possible after taking the action. This will help you show that you have complied with the terms and conditions of this licence. In doing so, we recommend you record in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any action that you, or a person other than you, has taken to comply with <a class="govuk-link" href="#advice-for-condition-1-alternative-lawful-methods">condition 1: alternative lawful methods</a>
</li>
  <li>the reasons why you concluded there was no satisfactory alternative to the action you took</li>
  <li>the date of any action you have taken</li>
  <li>where you took the action</li>
  <li>the species and serious damage purpose for which you took action</li>
  <li>the number of birds killed, or nests or eggs destroyed, for each species and purpose</li>
  <li>the method used to kill birds or take birds or destroy nests or eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>It is further recommended that you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep these records for 3 years, starting on the date on which the action is taken</li>
  <li>are able to produce these records on request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advice: familiarise yourself with the other relevant legislation</h2>

<p>We recommend that you familiarise yourself with other legislation that may be relevant to your circumstances when operating under this licence, including:</p>

<h3>Use of lead shot</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2170/contents/made" rel="external">Environmental Protection (Restriction on the use of Lead Shot) (England) Regulations 1999</a> prohibit the use of lead shot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on all foreshores (the seashore between the high-water and low-water marks)  in England</li>
  <li>in or over specified sites of special scientific interest (<abbr title="sites of special scientific interest">SSSIs</abbr>) - predominantly wetlands</li>
  <li>for the shooting of all ducks and geese, coot and moorhen</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shooting in severe weather</h3>

<p>Between 7 November and 20 February, in periods of severe weather, we recommend that you <a class="govuk-link" href="https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/severe-weather-scheme/" rel="external">check whether there is a voluntary or statutory suspension in place</a>.</p>

<p>During periods of statutory suspension, you can kill or take Canada geese if it’s essential.</p>

<h2>Advice for condition 1: alternative lawful methods</h2>

<p>We recommend that you, or the person authorising you to act under this licence, make all reasonable endeavours to carry out other activities, including other lawful methods of non-lethal control to achieve the serious damage purpose, before and whilst acting under this licence.</p>

<p>This means that you must consider what is reasonable both before, and whilst, acting under this licence. You must ensure that where appropriate, lawful methods of non-lethal control are carried out before acting under the licence, and whilst acting under this licence.</p>

<p>You do not need to use non-lethal methods of control, or continue to use them if you have tried them, if you consider them to be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not practical</li>
  <li>not effective</li>
  <li>disproportionate</li>
</ul>

<p>What is reasonable is fact dependent. It may depend, for example, on the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>species of bird</li>
  <li>size and type of land</li>
  <li>cost of using lawful methods not covered by this licence</li>
</ul>

<p>Some non-lethal methods have been shown to be effective for carrion crow, feral pigeon, jackdaw, magpie, rook or wood pigeon, see Table 3 for details.</p>

<p>Birds become used to certain non-lethal methods of control (‘habituation’) but you should not stop using non-lethal methods for this reason.</p>

<p>You will achieve the best outcomes by using a range of methods, sometimes reinforced by lethal action, which are regularly changed and revisited to combat habituation. Read Natural England’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-legal-measures-for-managing-wild-birds-wml-gu01">Wildlife Management Advice Note WML-GU01 Legal measures to resolve conflict with wild birds</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Advice for condition 2: protecting animal welfare</h2>

<p>When carrying out the authorised activities under this licence, you are reminded you must comply with all relevant legislation, including the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>

<p>We recommend that you read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wildlife-management-advice-notice-the-animal-welfare-act-2006-wml-gu02">The Animal Welfare Act 2006: what it means for wildlife</a> for information on how to comply with condition 2 of this licence.</p>

<p>If you do not comply with condition 2, you may also commit an offence under <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/section/4" rel="external">section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006</a> by causing unnecessary suffering.</p>

<p>This applies to the humane dispatch of captured animals and the treatment of animals held in traps or nets and includes decoy birds and non-target animals.</p>

<p>To protect the welfare of dependent young, we recommend that you avoid lethal control of birds under this licence during the breeding season whenever possible, by acting under this licence at other times of year or using non-lethal methods of control.</p>

<p>We recommend that if you need to capture and kill problem geese, you kill them out of sight of other geese of the same species.</p>

<h2>Advice for condition 4: using this licence on a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>
</h2>

<p>You can check if your proposed activity under this licence is in the area of a <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr>, and find out about the features for which that site is designated by using <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?chosenLayers=siteunitPIndex,siteunitIndex,sssiPIndex,sssiIndex,backdropDIndex,backdropIndex,europeIndex,vmlBWIndex,25kBWIndex,50kBWIndex,250kBWIndex,miniscaleBWIndex,baseIndex&amp;box=-1820960:-768320:3837280:2031680&amp;useDefaultbackgroundMapping=false" rel="external">Magic map</a>.</p>

<p>To find out if your proposed activity under this licence is listed as an ‘operation requiring Natural England’s consent’, we recommend that you check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx" rel="external">Designated Sites View</a> database. You’ll also find the contact details for the adviser for the <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> if you need advice.</p>

<p>If you’re a person who is not a section 28G authority, we recommend that you read the guide on<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-public-body-responsibilities"> how to get <abbr title="site of special scientific interest">SSSI</abbr> consent from Natural England</a>. If you carry out an ‘operation requiring Natural England’s consent’ without getting that consent, you are committing a criminal offence. This licence is not a consent for these purposes.</p>

<p>If you’re a 28G authority as defined in section 28G(3) of the 1981 Act, we recommend that you read the guide on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-public-body-responsibilities">sites of special scientific interest: public body responsibilities</a>.</p>

<p>If you already have a valid consent for predator control you may not need to notify Natural England before you operate under this licence. This licence is not a substitute for notifying Natural England  and if you do not do so, you are committing a criminal offence.</p>

<h2>Advice for condition 5: using this licence on or near some European sites</h2>

<p>For each protected site listed in Table 2, you can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://magic.defra.gov.uk/magicmap.aspx?chosenLayers=wildBirdGenLcnZone,backdropDIndex,backdropIndex,europeIndex,vmlBWIndex,25kBWIndex,50kBWIndex,250kBWIndex,miniscaleBWIndex,baseIndex&amp;box=-455120:189280:959440:889280&amp;useDefaultbackgroundMapping=false" rel="external">find the site boundary and its buffer zone</a> on the Magic map application.</p>

<p>If you’re acting under this licence in a protected site listed in Table 2, or its buffer zone, we recommend that you do all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make reasonable efforts to locate any breeding colony of the bird species that applies to you before carrying out any activity (which could include making local enquiries, but not any activity that disturbs any bird of that species)</li>
  <li>remain concealed and quiet, and covertly approach the birds you intend to kill or take under this licence</li>
  <li>use firearms fitted with sound moderators if you have the correct firearms licence - read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/firearms-licensing-police-guidance">guide on firearms licences</a> for more information</li>
  <li>avoid using a shooting-to-aid-scaring method nor any firearms without sound moderators, including shotguns, within the European site or its buffer zone</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work at a recommended safe distance</h3>

<p>We recommend that you work at a safe distance from the species protected on the European site to avoid disturbing them. When assessing the risk of disturbance and making a judgement on how to comply with condition 5, we recommend that you consider all of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lines of sight - for example, if you stay out of sight, you are less likely to cause disturbance</li>
  <li>sensitive times - for example, the species’ breeding season</li>
  <li>the type of activity you are undertaking and how likely it is to cause disturbance</li>
  <li>time of day you undertake activity under the licence, for example good daylight means you have better visibility</li>
  <li>weather conditions - you should avoid activity during prolonged adverse weather conditions (for example, spells of hard frost, heavy rainfall or snow, high winds or freezing temperatures) as nest failure is more likely in these conditions</li>
  <li>features such as hills, trees, scrub or buildings located between where you’re carrying out your operation and where the protected bird is in relation to this, may reduce direct line of sight, and may lessen the impact of shotgun noise</li>
  <li>specific bird behaviour - for example, some nesting birds will rely on their camouflage and vegetation cover for protection rather than taking flight when approached, but distress and disturbance is still likely to be caused even prior to the bird taking flight</li>
</ul>

<p>We recommend that you work at a safe distance from the protected birds listed in Table 4. Table 4 lists the recommended safe distances for carrying out authorised activities.</p>
