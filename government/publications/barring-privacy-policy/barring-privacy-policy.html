<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>  Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>1.1.</strong>  This is the Privacy Policy for the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) barring function. It tells you how we will use and protect any information we are required to collect about you.</p>

<p><strong>1.2.</strong>  This policy explains your rights as a barring customer of the DBS. There are further DBS privacy policies which cover other statutory functions undertaken by DBS. They can be accessed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-privacy-policies">here</a>. The policy explains why we need your personal data, what we will do with your data and what you can expect from us. It also explains how to get a copy of any personal data we may hold about you. This is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1.3.</strong> This policy tells you why the DBS collects and processes your data in compliance with the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It should be noted that in January 2021, the UK became a third country with regard to GDPR as the UK is no longer a member of the European Union.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Why DBS collects and uses information</h2>

<p><strong>2.1.</strong> DBS collects information in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>decide whether it is appropriate for a person to be placed on or removed from a barred list. This decision may include the use of any information that has been disclosed on a DBS certificate</li>
  <li>process requests for DBS checks - this will include searching police records and issuing a DBS certificate</li>
  <li>process ‘Adult First’ Checks - this service is only available to organisations who are eligible to access the DBS adults’ barred list and who have requested a check of the barred lists on their DBS application form</li>
  <li>process payments when appropriate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2.2.</strong> The information we collect about you depends on the reason you were referred to the DBS i.e. if you’re a witness or victim of the behaviour of the individual referred, have made an enquiry to DBS, have made a referral or have been given consent to receive information - however we may use the information for any of the purposes listed above.</p>

<p><strong>2.3.</strong> We may check information about you with other information we hold e.g.  previous referrals. We may request information from other identified relevant organisations e.g. police, Social Services etc.</p>

<p><strong>2.4.</strong> We may get information about you from employers and other identified relevant organisations e.g. Social Services, police, Keepers of Registers, Supervisory Authorities etc.</p>

<p><strong>2.5.</strong> The information is collected and processed in order to help employers make safer recruitment decisions and prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children.</p>

<p><strong>2.6.</strong> Your information may be used for testing purposes. Testing is undertaken to ensure that our IT systems function as per specified requirements. Where it is not practical to disguise your data or use dummy data, we will test our systems using your data. This testing will only take place in environments that are secured to the same level as our live system.</p>

<p><strong>2.7.</strong> You may also be contacted on a one-off basis for the purpose of gathering your views and obtaining feedback on the service you have received. This customer satisfaction insight will help us to improve our products and services. You may be contacted via email, SMS (text message), or by letter.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Data Controller</h2>

<p><strong>3.1.</strong> The DBS is the ‘data controller’ of information held by the DBS for the purposes of DPA/GDPR. A data controller determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is to be processed (alone, jointly or in common with others).</p>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong> We have responsibility for the safety and security of the data we hold.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Data Processor</h2>

<p><strong>4.1.</strong> Any supplier that works on behalf of the DBS is one of our ‘data processors’. A data processor is any organisation that processes data on behalf of the DBS. We make sure that our ‘data processors’ comply with all relevant requirements under data protection legislation.  This is defined in the contractual arrangements.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Contacting the Data Protection Officer</h2>

<p><strong>5.1.</strong> The DBS Data Protection Officer can be contacted via email at dbsdataprotection@dbs.gov.uk or in writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

DBS Data Protection Officer
<br>Disclosure and Barring Service
<br>PO Box 165
<br>Liverpool
<br>L69 3JD
<br>
</p></div></div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Legal Processing</h2>

<p><strong>6.1.</strong> For the Barring function your data is collected/requested and processed under the legal provision of <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/47/contents" rel="external">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006</a> (SVGA) / <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2007/1351/contents/made" rel="external">Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</a> (SVGO).</p>

<p><strong>6.2.</strong> This is to determine whether it is appropriate to include you in the children’s barred list and/or adults’ barred list. It is also used to provide employers with suitability information to make informed recruitment decisions should you make an application for an enhanced DBS with barred list check.</p>

<p>For further information about standard or enhanced DBS checks please access the relevant policies <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/standard-and-enhanced-dbs-check-privacy-policy">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> What personal data do we hold?</h2>

<p><strong>7.1.</strong> We will only hold your data if you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>been referred to the DBS for consideration under the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/47/contents" rel="external">Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006</a> (SVGA) or the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2007/1351/contents/made" rel="external">Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</a>
</li>
  <li>been cautioned or convicted for a ‘relevant (automatic barring) offence’ that leads to the DBS considering you for inclusion in one or both lists</li>
  <li>previously used the disclosure service, information disclosed by the police on a DBS certificate may be used for further consideration by barring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.2.</strong> We may be required to gather further information from relevant parties in order to consider your case. DBS will only request information that is relevant and where we are legally permitted to do so under SVGA/SVGO.</p>

<p><strong>7.3.</strong> The DBS also has access to Police National Computer (PNC) and police intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>7.4.</strong> The data we will hold will be personal details and often personally sensitive information i.e. mental health and/or criminal information.</p>

<p><strong>7.5.</strong> The DBS do not intentionally collect sensitive data (as defined in data protection legislation) that it is not relevant to our function.</p>

<p><strong>7.6.</strong> If we ask you for personal information, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure you know why we need this information</li>
  <li>only ask for information that we need</li>
  <li>ensure only those appropriate have access to it</li>
  <li>store your information securely</li>
  <li>inform you if the information will be shared with a third party</li>
  <li>ask you to agree to us sharing your information where you have a choice</li>
  <li>only keep your information for as long as we need to – see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Retention Policy</a>
</li>
  <li>not make it available for commercial use (such as marketing) without your permission</li>
  <li>ensure you are provided with a copy of data we hold on you, on request – this is called a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-subject-access-request">Subject Access Request</a>
</li>
  <li>ensure there are procedures in place for dealing promptly with any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-problem-criminal-record-certificate">disputes</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about/complaints-procedure">complaints</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.7.</strong> In return, we ask you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give us accurate information</li>
  <li>tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes to your details, such as a new address</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7.8.</strong> This helps us to keep your information reliable, up to date and secure. This will apply whether we hold your data on paper or in electronic form.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Who do DBS share data with?</h2>

<p><strong>8.1.</strong> SVGA Sch 3 Para 21 requires DBS to provide the Secretary of State with prescribed information relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inclusion in a barred list</li>
  <li>consideration of inclusion in one or both barred list(s)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8.2.</strong> This means that DBS may share information with other government departments. We will only share information where there is legislation enabling DBS to do so, and will only share what is relevant to their function, for example, the Department for Education.</p>

<p><strong>8.3.</strong> DBS is also required, and permitted, by legislation to share data with the following organisations. In the majority of cases, the DBS shares information on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>8.4.</strong> We may also share information where there is ‘legitimate interest’.</p>

<p>Legitimate interest requests are used by several bodies and, in some cases, individuals; they are commonly used by employers, managers of volunteers and local authorities who can demonstrate a need to know e.g. they are looking to employ an individual in regulated activity, or they make a referral to DBS and retain an interest in the person for example, they still employ them.</p>

<p>The legitimate interest request provision is included in secondary safeguarding legislation.</p>

<p>We will tell you if your information has been shared under the legitimate interest provision.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span> Retention of data</h2>

<p><strong>12.1.</strong> We operate a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-data-retention-policy">Data Retention Policy</a> to ensure that data is not held for longer than necessary.
