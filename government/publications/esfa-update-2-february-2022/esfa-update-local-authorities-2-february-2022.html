<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing exceptional premises costs claim form now open</h2>

<p>Schools and academies with secondary age pupils, along with colleges and other eligible establishments, can now submit claims for exceptional premises costs incurred during the mass testing of pupils and students on their return in January 2022.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges-exceptional-costs-guidance" class="govuk-link">claim submission guidance is available on GOV.UK</a> and the window to claim closes on Sunday 20 February 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: Get Help with Technology: internet access and device claim form now open</h2>

<p>The Get Help with Technology: internet access and device claim form is now live. The deadline to submit your claim is Sunday, 27 February 2022 at 11:59pm.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-help-with-technology-conditions-of-internet-access-and-device-grants/get-help-with-technology-programme-claim-form-guidance" class="govuk-link">published guidance</a> to help you complete <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/device-connectivity">the form</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-help-with-technology-conditions-of-internet-access-and-device-grants" class="govuk-link">read more on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Action: schools financial value standard (SFVS): upcoming deadlines for local authority maintained schools and local authorities</h2>

<p>We would like to remind you of the upcoming deadlines for the 2021 to 2022 schools financial value standard (SFVS), an annual return regarding good financial health and resource management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authority maintained schools must submit the SFVS to their local authority by 31 March 2022</li>
  <li>local authorities should submit their assurance statement to DfE by no later than 31 May 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>The SFVS asks questions of school leaders and governing bodies in six areas of resource management. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-financial-value-standard-sfvs" class="govuk-link">Guidance is available for schools</a>, which provides clarification on each question, examples of good practice, and details of further support. The 2021 to 2022 documents are very similar to those for the 2020 to 2021 reporting year. One notable change is the inclusion of reporting on related party transactions, in section F.</p>

<p>The school’s financial value standard assurance statement guidance is for local authorities and explains how to submit the SFVS assurance statement for the 2021 to 2022 financial year. The assurance statement for 2021 to 2022 will be made available in spring 2022. More information will be shared shortly.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Action: gender pay gap reporting 2022</h2>

<p>The statutory deadline for publishing gender pay gap data is approaching.</p>

<p>If you have 250 or more employees, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure your organisation has a nominated individual registered with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-gender-pay-gap-data" class="govuk-link">gender pay gap service</a>
</li>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: 2021 to 2022 dedicated schools grant (DSG) allocations</h2>

<p>We have updated the <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding" class="govuk-link" rel="external">2021 to 2022 DSG funding allocations</a> which show how much funding each local authority will receive, and how that funding has been calculated.</p>

<p>The updated allocations reflect the latest academies recoupment and early years data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Each year (subject to affordability) we award in-year growth funding to those grant-funded institutions which have recruited significantly more students than we allocated. In recognition of the funding pressures that many institutions are still facing this year because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we will continue to use the same methodology and thresholds for allocating these funds that was introduced for 2020 to 2021. The exception is a slight change to the method for awarding Element 2 funding for specialist post-16 institutions and the centrally funded exceptions.</p>

<p>We have now published the details of the calculation for awarding exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022. We will be informing institutions eligible for growth by mid-February and revised funding allocations will be available through <a rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange" class="govuk-link">Document Exchange</a>.</p>

<span class="number">11. </span>Information: consultation launched on the teacher misconduct regime operated by the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)</h2>

<p>We have launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/teacher-misconduct-regulating-the-teaching-profession">consultation</a> seeking views on our proposals to broaden the scope of the teacher misconduct regime in England.</p>

<p>Please use the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/safeguarding-in-schools-team/teacher-misconduct-regulating-the-teaching-profess/">Department for Education e-consultation platform Citizen Space</a> to access the consultation. Please use the online survey to provide your feedback.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this consultation, please email <a href="mailto:TRegulation.CONSULTATION@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">TRegulation.CONSULTATION@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The consultation closes at 23:45 on Monday 14 March 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12. </span>Information: publication of the revised ‘Teacher misconduct: the prohibition of teachers’ advice (the Advice), and government response</h2>

<p>Following the consultation in autumn 2021, we have carefully considered all responses received and have, where possible, reflected those responses in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-misconduct-the-prohibition-of-teachers--3">revised version of the Advice</a>, and addressed them in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/teacher-misconduct-the-prohibition-of-teachers-advice">government response to the consultation</a>, both of which have now been published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Teachers are the single most important factor in a child’s education and the overwhelming majority are highly competent and effective, and never engage in any form of misconduct, but it is of paramount importance that children are protected when they are at school and college. The Advice and the government response reflect the standards expected of all teachers and set out the robust arrangements in place to safeguard pupils and students.</p>
