<span class="number">11. </span>Information: exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Each year (subject to affordability) we award in-year growth funding to those grant-funded institutions which have recruited significantly more students than we allocated. In recognition of the funding pressures that many institutions are still facing this year because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we will continue to use the same methodology and thresholds for allocating these funds that was introduced for 2020 to 2021. The exception is a slight change to the method for awarding Element 2 funding for specialist post-16 institutions and the centrally funded exceptions.</p>

<p>We have now published the details of the calculation for awarding exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022. We will be informing institutions eligible for growth by mid-February and revised funding allocations will be available through <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange">Document Exchange</a>.</p>

<span class="number">13. </span>Information: consultation launched on the teacher misconduct regime operated by the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA)</h2>

<p>We have launched a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/teacher-misconduct-regulating-the-teaching-profession">consultation</a> seeking views on our proposals to broaden the scope of the teacher misconduct regime in England.</p>

<p>Please use the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/safeguarding-in-schools-team/teacher-misconduct-regulating-the-teaching-profess/">Department for Education e-consultation platform Citizen Space</a> to access the consultation. Please use the online survey to provide your feedback.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this consultation, please email <a href="mailto:TRegulation.CONSULTATION@education.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">TRegulation.CONSULTATION@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The consultation closes at 23:45 on Monday 14 March 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span>Information: publication of the revised ‘Teacher misconduct: the prohibition of teachers’ advice (the Advice), and government response</h2>

<p>Following the consultation in autumn 2021, we have carefully considered all responses received and have, where possible, reflected those responses in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teacher-misconduct-the-prohibition-of-teachers--3" class="govuk-link">revised version of the Advice</a>, and addressed them in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/teacher-misconduct-the-prohibition-of-teachers-advice">government response to the consultation</a>, both of which have now been published on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Teachers are the single most important factor in a child’s education and the overwhelming majority are highly competent and effective, and never engage in any form of misconduct, but it is of paramount importance that children are protected when they are at school and college. The Advice and the government response reflect the standards expected of all teachers and set out the robust arrangements in place to safeguard pupils and students.</p>
