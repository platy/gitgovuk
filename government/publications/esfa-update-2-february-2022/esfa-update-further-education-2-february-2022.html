<span class="number">5. </span>Reminder: flexi-job apprenticeship scheme</h2>

<p>As you will have seen in previous ESFA updates and press, we are launching a pilot scheme for flexi-job apprenticeships (previously known as portable apprenticeships) beginning in April 2022. Flexi-job apprenticeship put apprentices in the driving seat apprentices and enable them to complete their apprenticeship across multiple short employment contracts.</p>

<p>We launched an Expression of Interest for the pilot in December 2021 to invite providers to submit an application to engage in the pilot to test an exciting new model of apprenticeship delivery and support ongoing developments in the apprenticeship programme.</p>

<p>The Expression of Interest and further details about flexi-job apprenticeships can be found on the <a href="https://education.app.jaggaer.com/web/login.html" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Department for Education eSourcing portal</a>.</p>

<p>Following a request from a provider to accommodate business needs, we have extended the closing date for the expression of interest to 4 February 2022.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: payments for Care to Learn and 16 to 19 Bursary Fund</h2>

<p>We have published data showing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-esfa-payment-data-for-care-to-learn-and-bursary-fund-for-students-from-vulnerable-groups-schemes#history" class="govuk-link">aggregate payments made to childcare providers and education institutions</a>, for both Care to Learn and the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund for students in defined vulnerable groups.

<p>The Care to Learn scheme helps young parents (aged under 20) to continue in education after the birth of a child. ESFA provides funding towards childcare and travel costs whilst the young parent is engaged in a study programme. The 16 to 19 Bursary Fund provides financial support to help care leavers, students in care, or in receipt of specific benefits, to remain in education.</p>

<span class="number">9. </span>Information: technical specification to accountability framework for apprenticeship training providers</h2>

<p>In August 2021, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apprenticeship-training-provider-accountability-framework-20212022">we published a new framework for apprenticeship training provider accountability</a>.  Due to continuing impact from Covid19, 2021 to 2022 will be a transition year for the Framework arrangements. The Technical Specification sets out the key principles and objectives of the framework, alongside the indicators that will be used to assess provider quality and the range of interventions.</p>

<p>We are issuing this technical specification as a clarification version to give you the opportunity to provide feedback on how we can make them clearer or better understood. Please email any feedback to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:provider.strategy@education.gov.uk">provider.strategy@education.gov.uk</a> by 1 March 2022.</p>

<p>Following a review of any feedback, we will update the specification to reflect any clarifications by the end of April 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Information: exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Each year (subject to affordability) we award in-year growth funding to those grant-funded institutions which have recruited significantly more students than we allocated. In recognition of the funding pressures that many institutions are still facing this year because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we will continue to use the same methodology and thresholds for allocating these funds that was introduced for 2020 to 2021. The exception is a slight change to the method for awarding Element 2 funding for specialist post-16 institutions and the centrally funded exceptions.</p>

<p>We have now published the details of the calculation for awarding exceptional in-year growth for 2021 to 2022. We will be informing institutions eligible for growth by mid-February and revised funding allocations will be available through <a href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/document-exchange" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Document Exchange</a>.</p>

<span class="number">13. </span>Information: ventilation update and delivery of CO2 monitors</h2>

<p>To help settings manage ventilation, we have delivered over 350,000 CO2 monitors to over 99% of eligible maintained schools, further education colleges and the majority of early years settings.</p>

<p>We will fulfil all eligible applications that we have received from 1,265 settings for air cleaning units. To do so, we are making a total of up to 9,000 air cleaning units available for poorly ventilated teaching spaces in state-funded education settings, where quick fixes to improve ventilation are not possible.</p>

<p>We will contact eligible settings directly to confirm arrangements for deliveries, which started this week. The <a rel="external" href="https://find-dfe-approved-framework.service.gov.uk/list/air-cleaning?utm_source=27%20January%202022%20C19&amp;utm_medium=Daily%20Email%20C19&amp;utm_campaign=DfE%20C19" class="govuk-link">air cleaning marketplace</a> also remains open for any state-funded settings that wish to purchase air cleaning units at a suitable specification directly from suppliers.</p>

<p>Further information on ventilation is available in:</p>
