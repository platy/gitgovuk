<h2>About the scheme</h2>

<p>The government wants to help businesses install electric vehicle (<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>) chargepoints for their operations and staff.  The&nbsp;Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>)&nbsp;administers the grant on behalf of&nbsp;the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>This is an interim manual service that will be in place until a digital service for this scheme goes live (expected autumn 2022).</p>
</div>

<p>To access the grant, a business must first register. Installers approved by <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> can then make claims for work completed on its behalf.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> infrastructure grant for staff and fleets will give money towards the infrastructure businesses need for chargepoints, as well as for installing the chargepoints themselves.</p>

<p>The grant means businesses do not have to install all the chargepoints the infrastructure allows for. It permits them to plan for the future by creating infrastructure now that can enable chargepoints to be installed later on.</p>

<p>There is a separate and different grant from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#workplace-charging-scheme">Workplace Charging Scheme</a>, which does not help towards the cost of chargepoint infrastructure. Both grants may be used for the same site, but not the same chargepoints.</p>

<p>The government reserves the right to terminate the grant at any time, but will aim to provide 4 weeks’ notice.</p>

<p>Should the grant rate change or the scheme end, the government will honour grant claims made before the date of any public announcement subject to meeting all relevant criteria set out in this guidance. The announcement will detail how claims made after it will be treated.</p>

<h2>Who can apply</h2>

<p>This grant is for small and medium sized businesses that want to install <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoints on their properties.</p>

<p>The business must be registered at Companies House. If not, it must be <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registered with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>). If the business is not registered at either, it will not be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>The business must have 249 employees or less.</p>

<p>The business must satisfy state aid requirements. It must have received – or have currently pending at the time of application – less than €200,000 of public support in the past 3 financial years and satisfy the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/workplace-charging-scheme-guidance-for-applicants#state-aid">state aid requirements for de minimis aid</a>.</p>

<h2>Grant rules and restrictions</h2>

<p>A business can receive up to 5 grants in total. Each grant must be for a different site that the business owns, leases or rents.</p>

<p>The chargepoints installed must be exclusively for staff or fleet use. A fleet may comprise vehicles owned or leased by the customer or vehicles used by its suppliers that are essential to the business function. They cannot be for visitor or guest use. Applicants must be able to provide evidence to verify this on request (for example, details of a parking policy or photographic evidence).</p>

<p>The grant supports the provision of chargepoints and future chargepoint locations where chargepoints may be installed at a later date. A minimum of 5 parking spaces must be provisioned with charging infrastructure, at least one of which must have a working chargepoint.</p>

<p>Each grant application can be for up to a maximum of £15,000. If more chargepoints are needed in addition to those provided by this grant, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-grants-for-low-emission-vehicles#workplace-charging-scheme">Workplace Charging Scheme</a> may be used.</p>

<p>One application must be handled by one installer.</p>

<p>The costs of each installation must not be inflated or cross-subsidised across multiple installations. If evidence of cost inflation or cross-subsidisation is discovered, the installer’s authorisation will be revoked.</p>

<h3>Eligible locations</h3>

<p>The site of the installation must be in England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Locations in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man are not included.</p>

<p>Where an installation requires cabling or other parts of the installation to be placed in or on another person’s property, or public land, access rights and permissions must be agreed by all parties using legally binding arrangements, such as legal covenants, before an installation begins.</p>

<p>If you are concerned your customer may exceed their grant allocation, contact <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:CarparkGrantEnq@dvla.gov.uk">CarparkGrantEnq@dvla.gov.uk</a> to confirm how many grants they have been awarded. <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will only be able to confirm the number of grants already approved and not those that may be awaiting processing, or submission, by an installer.</p>

<h3>Parking requirements</h3>

<p>The car park must have at least 5 parking spaces that are clearly marked.</p>

<p>The parking facilities must be clearly associated with the applicant’s premises and be either on-site or a reasonable distance from the place of work. The car park may be continuous or comprise several discrete areas.</p>

<p>The space where you install your chargepoint(s) and infrastructure must be private off-street parking.</p>

<p>Your customer must own the land or have the sole legal right to it.</p>

<h3>Equipment requirements</h3>

<p>All chargepoints claimed for under the grant must be on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list">Workplace Charging Scheme approved chargepoint model</a> at the time of installation. It is important to ensure that the chargepoint model name is exactly the same as one stated on the eligible list. If a model is not listed, it is not eligible for grant.</p>

<p>Where multiple chargepoints are installed at a property, each socket installed should be able to charge a vehicle located in at least one, unique, and clearly defined parking space.</p>

<p>There shall be no more than one socket installed for each accessible parking space.</p>

<p>The number of sockets a chargepoint has is defined by how many vehicles it can simultaneously charge. Details of how many sockets a chargepoint has may be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list">list of <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved chargepoint models.</a></p>

<p>Where chargepoints are installed, the parking spaces must be suitable for a chargepoint installation. They must be able to permit an electric vehicle to be charged safely. The intended user must be able to access the parking space at all times. Installers are expected to determine if the parking will permit an eligible vehicle to be charged safely.&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will not intervene in any negative assessment made by an installer.</p>

<p>The chargepoints are listed at the request of their manufacturers. If a chargepoint is not present, contact the chargepoint manufacturer to confirm why it is not listed.</p>

<h3>Charging infrastructure</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> infrastructure grant for staff and fleets covers the costs of installing the infrastructure needed for chargepoints to operate and for future chargepoints to be installed.</p>

<p>The charging infrastructure must comprise at least the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new electrical connection at a metered electrical supply point, such as a consumer unit or feeder pillar</li>
  <li>a dedicated, safe, unobstructed route for electrical cabling from the electrical supply point to the installed chargepoints and any future connection locations</li>
  <li>any future connection locations</li>
  <li>provisions to facilitate the safe installation of an electric vehicle chargepoint</li>
  <li>any chargepoints that are installed</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the charging infrastructure, a dedicated, safe, unobstructed route must be made from the electrical supply point to allow for the future provision of all necessary electrical cabling to each identified future connection location without the need for building work in connection to the electrical cabling installation.</p>

<p>This may be achieved using any combination of electrical containment systems, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>electric cable ducting including drawstrings</li>
  <li>electric cable trunking or conduits</li>
  <li>electric cable trays and cable ladders</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Building work may still be required for aspects of the chargepoint beyond the installation of the electrical cabling.</p>
</div>

<p>Future chargepoint locations must have cabling from a metered power supply and enable a chargepoint to be installed at a future date at that location and operate.</p>

<p>The future chargepoint locations must be ready for someone to install chargepoints at a future date with minimal infrastructure work. Examples of how this may be achieved are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have installed a busbar system with connection locations for future chargepoints</li>
  <li>you installed a concrete plinth or footing for a future chargepoint that is connected to a metered electricity supply</li>
</ul>

<p>The work undertaken, and charging infrastructure provided, must ensure there is appropriate power for all the chargepoints and future connection locations. This may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>power upgrades to the local supply or network</li>
  <li>implementation of load balancing solutions</li>
  <li>upgrades to the building’s electrical control room</li>
</ul>

<p>The charging infrastructure provided must include any additional earthing needed for the chargepoint and identification of any earthing locations needed for any future connection locations.</p>

<h3>Eligible costs</h3>

<p>In addition to the cost of the provision of the charging infrastructure listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#charging">Charging infrastructure</a>, the grant may also cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any onsite software and/or hardware required to manage and maintain the chargepoints. The cost of any ongoing software support or services is not eligible</li>
  <li>any communications media, such as wi-fi or cellular repeaters, required to operate the chargepoints</li>
  <li>grid connections, but not any costs associated with grid reinforcement</li>
  <li>concrete plinths or footings for future chargepoints</li>
  <li>any associated signage</li>
  <li>any associated reinstatement work</li>
  <li>any associated vehicle barriers</li>
  <li>the cost of chargepoint units</li>
  <li>any additional electrical components or hardware required for the chargepoint units</li>
  <li>civil engineering works</li>
  <li>labour costs (for installation of chargepoints or infrastructure)</li>
  <li>project management and reporting costs</li>
  <li>the&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>&nbsp;incurred by the customer. For enquiries relating to&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>, contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/vat-enquiries"><abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>/<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>: general enquiries</a>
</li>
  <li>site survey works (when leading to a completed installation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where an additional smart meter or current clamp device is required, the capital cost of this is also eligible expenditure providing it is installed at the same time as the chargepoint.</p>

<p>Examples of ineligible expenditure include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interest charges, bad debts, profits, entertaining</li>
  <li>administration costs</li>
  <li>maintenance costs</li>
  <li>inflation and contingency allowances (as an overall arbitrary percentage) additional to eligible costs. However, reasonable inflation rates can be included in labour and material cost estimates</li>
  <li>new/additional land required for the proposed infrastructure</li>
  <li>electricity provided by relevant infrastructure</li>
  <li>ongoing back-office data provision</li>
  <li>any other ongoing operating costs (for example, maintenance or communication)</li>
  <li>any warranty extension beyond 3 years</li>
  <li>transport costs</li>
  <li>marketing costs</li>
  <li>any other cost not listed as an eligible expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the grant works</h2>

<p>The grant involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your customer must register with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-for-staff-and-fleets-customer-guidance"><abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> infrastructure grant for staff and fleets registration form</a>.</li>
  <li>You agree work to be undertaken at a property owned or managed by your customer.</li>
  <li>Once work is complete, you, as an approved installer, apply for the grant on your customer’s behalf. You will need tell <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> what was installed and send evidence to verify this. This will include a copy of your invoice, photos of the chargepoints installed and a diagram of the car park indicating the work completed.</li>
  <li>You invoice your customer with a final invoice. This should show the total cost of the installation (including any&nbsp;<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr>&nbsp;charged) and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;grant that is offset against that total.</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will process your application and inform you of the result.</li>
  <li>If the grant is awarded, <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> will pay the grant to you.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Customer registration</h3>

<p>Before your customer can apply for a grant, they must register with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> and get a registration ID number. This will allow us to confirm they are eligible.</p>

<p>To register, your customer will need one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>company registration number</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registration number</li>
</ul>

<p>They will also need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a contact email address</li>
  <li>contact address corresponding to that registered with Companies House or their <abbr title="value added tax">VAT</abbr> registration</li>
</ul>

<p>They will need to complete the Chargepoint grants staff and fleets registration form and email it to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk">LandlordAccounts@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Once your customer’s details are verified, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> will provide them with a registration ID number for the scheme.</p>

<h3>How much you can claim</h3>

<p>The infrastructure grant pays towards both the infrastructure and the chargepoints that you install at the same time as the infrastructure.</p>

<h4>For charging infrastructure</h4>

<p>Businesses can get up to £500 for each parking space that the charging infrastructure will provide a unique chargepoint socket to, either from installed chargepoints or those that will be installed at a future date via the future connection locations.</p>

<h4>For chargepoints</h4>

<p>Businesses can get up to £350 towards the cost of buying and installing each chargepoint socket provided. This is in addition to the amount available for providing a space with charging infrastructure.</p>

<h4>The grant cap</h4>

<p>The total amount of grant funding available cannot be more than 75% of the cost of the installation of the chargepoints and infrastructure charged to the customer (as stated on your invoice).</p>

<p>The amount available per grant is capped at £15,000.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Examples of how much the EV infrastructure grant could be worth</h4>

<p>To qualify for the grant, as a minimum you would need to provision 5 parking spaces with charging infrastructure, and to install 1 chargepoint socket. This installation would provide for a maximum available grant of £2,850.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>If 5 spaces are provisioned with charging infrastructure (via one single socketed chargepoint and 4 future connection locations for single socketed chargepoints) with a maximum available grant of 5 x £500 = £2,500</p>

<p>1 chargepoint socket with a maximum available grant of £350</p>

<p>Maximum available grant = £2,850</p>

<p>If the total cost of the work completed was £2,000, the grant amount available would be 75% of that total, equating to £1,500.</p>

<p>If the total cost of the work was £5,000, the amount of grant available would be capped at £2,850.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>If 10 spaces are provisioned with charging infrastructure (via one single socketed chargepoint and 9 future connection locations for single socketed chargepoints) with a maximum available grant of 10 x £500 = £5,000</p>

<p>1 chargepoint socket with a maximum available grant of £350</p>

<p>Maximum available grant = £5,350</p>

<p>If the total cost of the work completed was £6,000, the grant amount available would be 75% of that total, equating to £4,500.</p>

<p>If the total cost of the work was £10,000, the amount of grant available would be capped at £5,350.</p>
</div>

<h3>Before you apply for a grant</h3>

<p>Before you begin, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarise yourself with the <a class="govuk-link" href="#rules">grant rules and restrictions</a>
</li>
  <li>agree with your customer what they want installed, checking that the chargepoints are listed on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/workplace-charging-scheme-approved-chargepoint-list"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr> approved chargepoint model list</a>
</li>
  <li>identify if any upgrades are needed to the electrical supply and arrange with a distributed network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) for this to be done before applying for the grant</li>
  <li>ask your customer how they will manage the chargepoints once they are installed, including maintenance and electricity costs</li>
  <li>ensure accessibility needs will be addressed when installing an <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> chargepoint, particularly for <abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr> owners who may be disabled or have mobility needs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview of the grant application process</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;administers the infrastructure grant for staff and fleets on behalf of&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>. Installers should submit grant claims (form and supporting documents) to&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/olev-installation-grant/" rel="external">through the&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;installation grant portal</a>.</p>

<p>The following steps illustrate the processes relating to the scheme from an installer’s perspective:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take an enquiry from a customer.</li>
  <li>Verify your customer has registered with <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> and obtain their registration details.</li>
  <li>Verify that the property meets the&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;requirements.</li>
  <li>Conduct a site survey to ensure that the existing equipment and property is suitable for an installation. After any load management is applied, there must be sufficient electrical supply for all the installed chargepoints. If the supply is not sufficient or suitable, contact the local distribution network operator (<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>) or independent distribution network operator (<abbr title="independent distribution network operator">iDNO</abbr>) to upgrade the supply before starting work.</li>
  <li>Install the infrastructure and chargepoint(s) and turn the chargepoints on and verify they work safely.</li>
  <li>Complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-staff-and-fleets-installer-guidance">infrastructure grant for staff and fleets installation form</a> with the customer – the customer will be required to verify that the information provided is correct and will need to sign it.</li>
  <li>Notify the relevant <abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr> and submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate.</li>
  <li>Invoice the customer (less any deposit paid). The customer should not be invoiced for the grant amount.</li>
  <li>Compile and submit a monthly grant claim form and supporting documents – send the claim form to&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;by the last working day of the month following installation.</li>
  <li>Receive a grant from&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;or respond to claim feedback from&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Retain copies of all customer details and required documents.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Documents required</h3>

<p>For each installation, the installer must provide a completed&nbsp;infrastructure grant for staff and fleets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-staff-and-fleets-installer-guidance">installation form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-staff-and-fleets-installer-guidance">claim form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following documentation will also be required:</p>

<h4>1. Photographic evidence of the chargepoint installation</h4>

<p>You need to provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a close-up picture of each chargepoint that is installed</li>
  <li>one or more pictures showing all the chargepoints in situ. Each of these should clearly show the parking space(s) associated with each chargepoint. At least one should show, if possible, the associated building</li>
</ul>

<p>When multiple pictures are supplied, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr> may request additional information to verify them against the details provided for the chargepoints or the diagram provided of the car park.</p>

<p>To reduce this need and speed up your application, installers should consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>naming the chargepoint picture files to correspond to the serial numbers of the chargepoint in the picture</li>
  <li>naming the car park picture files to correspond to the parts of the car park they relate to</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, installers may annotate the pictures to aid interpretation.</p>

<h4>2. A diagram of the car park showing chargepoint locations and future connection locations</h4>

<p>You must provide a diagram of the car park showing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the location of the car park with respect to the building(s) it is associated with and any access roads</li>
  <li>the parking spaces in the car park as they are marked</li>
  <li>the location of the metered electricity supply point</li>
  <li>the location of any installed chargepoints and their sockets. The diagram should indicate which parking spaces <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> will use to access the sockets</li>
  <li>the future connection locations and the location of any sockets of any future chargepoints. The diagram should indicate which parking spaces <abbr title="electric vehicles">EVs</abbr> will use to access the sockets</li>
  <li>cable routes and the path they take from the metered electricity supply point to the chargepoints and future connection locations</li>
  <li>a key describing any symbols or abbreviations you use</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram should be representative of the car park and permit a person to readily identify the features identified when visiting the location. It need not be to scale.</p>

<p>Where a chargepoint socket may service more than one parking space, the diagram should indicate this by locating its position on the intersection of those spaces.</p>

<p>For multistory car parks and other similarly complex parking spaces, more than one diagram may be provided. These should be labelled so that it is clear which part of the car park each diagram refers to.</p>

<h4>Example of a car park diagram showing chargepoint locations and future connection locations</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Car park diagram showing 3 chargepoints, 5 chargepoint sockets, 5 future sockets, 3 future connection locations, cable routes and an electricity meter." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/148344/car-park-diagram.jpg"></div></figure>

<h4>3. A copy of the invoice supplied provided to your customer</h4>

<p>The invoice should clearly show the date it was raised, the customer details, the amount charged to the customer and the amount discounted. If more than one invoice was raised, then all the invoices should be provided (preferably in one file). The total cost must match that stated on the grant claim form.</p>

<h4>4. A copy of the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;notification email or monthly spreadsheet listing installations</h4>

<p>The form can be downloaded by installers from the Energy Networks Association (ENA) website. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/assets/images/Resource%20library/Single-Electric-Vehicle-Charge-Point-and-Heat-Pump-Installation-Application-Form.doc" rel="external">single notification form</a> and a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/industry-hub/resource-library/low-carbon-technologies-multi-install-application-form.xlsx" rel="external">multi-notification spreadsheet</a> that must be submitted <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.energynetworks.org/operating-the-networks/connecting-to-the-networks" rel="external">directly to the network operator</a>.</p>

<p>If this is not supplied, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<h4>5. A copy of the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</h4>

<p>If this is not supplied, your claim will be rejected.</p>

<p>The grant submissions must not be combined with claim forms for other chargepoint grants. If they are they will be rejected.</p>

<p>The installer must ensure that parts A and B of the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-staff-and-fleets-installer-guidance">infrastructure grant for staff and fleets installation form</a> are signed and dated by the customer, and part C is signed and dated by the installer. All parts of the&nbsp;form must be completed.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserves the right to seek further information or documentary evidence from relevant parties in support of any individual claim.</p>

<p>Installers may attach their logos to these forms if they choose. Please note that&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;is unable to provide a proofing service to verify if you have completed the form correctly.</p>

<h3>Retention of documents</h3>

<p>Chargepoint installers must retain all documentary evidence for at least 3 years after an installation is completed. This information may be stored electronically or in hard copy and must be available to&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;immediately if requested as part of the grant claim assurance process.</p>

<p>A record must be kept of expenditure funded partly or wholly by grant claims and all income generated by the scheme.</p>

<p>All accounting records relating to that expenditure and income must be retained for a period of at least 6 years after each grant claim.</p>

<p>Accounting records include purchase orders, original invoices, receipts, accounts and deeds, whether in writing or electronic form. Such records must also be kept for any income generated with the help of grant.</p>

<p>The chargepoint installers must make these available at any reasonable time for inspection by officials from the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) or their representatives or by the Comptroller and Auditor General or his representatives.</p>

<h3>Installation requirements</h3>

<p>Chargepoint installations must be carried out in accordance with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr> EN 61851-1:2019</li>
  <li>the current edition of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (<abbr title="Institution of Engineering and Technology">IET</abbr>) Wiring Regulations – currently <abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr> 7671:2018+A1:2020</li>
  <li>the recommendations of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/installer-guidance-electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme/electric-vehicle-homecharge-scheme-guidance-for-manufacturers-and-installers#fn:2"><abbr title="Institution of Engineering and Technology">IET</abbr> Code of Practice for Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment Installations (as amended)</a>
</li>
  <li>the Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>The final installation must meet the electrical safety provisions under relevant building regulations.</p>

<p>Equipment installed must meet the applicable minimum IP ratings set out in <abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr> EN 61851-1:2019 and <abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr> 7671:2018 according to the usage location.</p>

<p>The electrical supply of the final installation should allow the charging equipment to operate at full rated capacity. Where local supply constraints prevent operation at full rated capacity, the charging equipment shall be classified according to actual output capacity.</p>

<p>Charging equipment must be supplied with an on-site 3-year warranty on parts and installation. Should the customer encounter any issues within the warranty period they should contact their chargepoint installer or manufacturer to request rectification of the problem.</p>

<h3>Accessibility needs</h3>

<p>When installing&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoints, it is important to consider who may use them, particularly&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;owners who may be disabled or have mobility issues.</p>

<p>All installation taking place should consider the requirements of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://shop.bsigroup.com/products/design-of-an-accessible-and-inclusive-built-environment-external-environment-code-of-practice" rel="external"><abbr title="British Standards">BS</abbr> 8300-1:2018 (Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment – External environment. Code of practice)</a> and the requirements of disabled people or those with mobility issues.</p>

<h3>Help with wider responsibilities of property owners and managers</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1541/contents/made" rel="external">Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005</a> requires property managers and owners to assess potential fire risks and put in place adequate and proportionate fire protection measures to mitigate against the risk to life from fire and then maintain them. This should be updated when installing&nbsp;<abbr title="electric vehicle">EV</abbr>&nbsp;chargepoints.</p>

<p>The government will produce guidance to aid this assessment for electric vehicle fires, available in 2022. This will identify mitigations and measures that can be taken when installing electric vehicle chargepoints in enclosed car parks. As such it will help building owners meet their existing duties under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.</p>

<h2>Installer responsibilities</h2>

<p>Installers must not charge customers for the grant in advance of payment being made by&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>For each application the installer must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirm your customer meets the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoints are approved</li>
  <li>ensure that the installed chargepoints are tested to verify they are fully functioning and meet safety requirements</li>
  <li>ensure the same chargepoint is not claimed for twice</li>
  <li>ensure there is adequate electrical supply for all the chargepoints installed once any load balancing technology is applied</li>
  <li>retain all documentation pertaining to the installation, including installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates, photographs, customer declarations and signatures, dates of installation and full address</li>
  <li>record photographic evidence that demonstrates that the existing equipment and the installation meet the&nbsp;schemes&nbsp;requirements</li>
  <li>ensure that all relevant fields on the grant application form are completed</li>
  <li>notify the&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;of the installation</li>
  <li>submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interaction with customers</h3>

<p>The installer must make the customer aware of the conditions that need to be met for them to be eligible for the grant.</p>

<p>The customer must sign a declaration in parts A and B of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ev-infrastructure-grant-for-staff-and-fleets-installer-guidance">infrastructure grant for staff and fleets installation form</a> confirming that they understand the conditions of the scheme and that the information supplied is correct.</p>

<p>A third party nominated by the customer may take responsibility for signing part B on the day of installation, confirming the unique chargepoint serial number, the amount charged and that the installation has been completed.</p>

<p>The installer must ensure they have 2 signatures and there are no gaps. If not, the claim will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Penalties for improper conduct</h3>

<p>Where there is reasonable evidence to suggest improper conduct on behalf of an installer,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserves the right to withhold payment pending further investigation.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;reserves the right to withhold payment from the installer where the installer was aware of changes in circumstances that affect the customer’s eligibility and failed to inform&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>.</p>

<p>Any authorised installers or authorised installer representative responsible for chargepoint installations that do not comply with the requirements of the scheme risk being removed from the scheme and their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.electricalcompetentperson.co.uk/" rel="external">competent person schemes (CPS)</a> operator being notified, particularly if there is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>failure to inform the relevant&nbsp;<abbr title="distribution network operator">DNO</abbr>&nbsp;of a chargepoint installation</li>
  <li>failure to submit a BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate</li>
  <li>an installation is found to be unsafe</li>
  <li>an installation does not meet the standards required for the scheme</li>
  <li>a site survey was not conducted, or an installation continued when the survey identified that the existing supply or distribution equipment was not safe</li>
  <li>inflation of costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>How and when to submit a claim</h2>

<p>The grant can only be claimed by&nbsp;<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>&nbsp;approved installers (on behalf of their customers) who are accredited by a CPS at the time of installation.</p>

<p>A claim may comprise an application for a grant for one or more installations.</p>

<p>Claim forms and required documentation should be sent directly to <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://forms.dft.gov.uk/olev-installation-grant/" rel="external"><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;installation grant portal</a>. If for any reason this cannot be used, contact <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you have forgotten your&nbsp;<abbr title="Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme">EVHS</abbr>&nbsp;installer number, contact&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Installer.Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Installers may generate their own electronic versions of the installation form. However, they must be in the same format and contain the same information as the&nbsp;original. Otherwise, they will be rejected.</p>

<p>Chargepoint installers should submit their claim on a monthly basis.&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;is not able to process claims more frequently.</p>

<p>Within a single claim the installations applied for must be for a single month only. Any claims that include applications across more than one month will not be accepted.</p>

<p>Claims must be submitted before the last working day of the month following that in which the installations were carried out. Installers do not have to wait until the last working day of the month to submit a claim – they can be submitted as soon as the claim form is ready.</p>

<p>If installers cannot meet the deadline for submissions, they should make <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;aware as soon as possible by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk">ChargePointGrantApps@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;helpdesk can be contacted for queries relating to your monthly claim using this email address or by calling 0300 123 1343.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Worked examples</h4>

<p>If installations were to occur on 1 February and 13 February, an installer must submit a claim for both installations before 31 March.</p>

<p>If installations were to occur on 28 February and 1 March, an installer must submit a claim for the February installation by 31 March and a second, separate claim for the March installation by 30 April (as it occurred in a different calendar month).</p>

<p>If an installer enters administration, payment will be made by&nbsp;OZEV&nbsp;to its administrator.</p>
</div>

<h3>Resubmissions</h3>

<p>You should resubmit applications as soon as you are confident that you have all the required information for a grant application to be approved.</p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;retains the right to disqualify any resubmission claims not submitted to&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;with the full correct evidence within one calendar year of installation. Such claims received after one year may be processed at our discretion.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to process claims older than one year at the grant rate prevailing at the time the full correct evidence is received if lower than the rate at the time of installation.</p>

<h3>Processing times</h3>

<h4>First time applicants</h4>

<p>First payment(s) may take up to 3 months to process following the first submission of a claim.</p>

<p>When an installer makes a successful claim for the first time, they need to be set up as a vendor on&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s finance system to facilitate payment. The bank account information an installer provided at the time they were authorised will be used for this.</p>

<p>As an installer, you may be asked to verify this information.&nbsp;<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>&nbsp;will aim to do this as quickly as possible, but any inaccuracy in the information provided or delay in responding will result in a delay to this process and payment.</p>

<h4>Subsequent applications</h4>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;aims to process claims within 30 working days.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;will inform chargepoint installers if claims are successful or unsuccessful. If&nbsp;<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency">DVLA</abbr>&nbsp;notifies you that a claim has been successful, payment may take up to a further 10 working days to complete.</p>

<p>This is only a guideline. Circumstances may mean that payments or processing takes longer. Where possible,&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will provide installers with information about any delays.</p>

<h2>Chargepoint audits</h2>

<p><abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, will conduct on-site audits of installed chargepoints to verify the information supplied and ensure the requirements of the grant are met.</p>

<p>If a grant is selected for audit&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>, or its representatives, may contact the installer or applicant for further information, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>installation and commissioning confirmations and certificates (including the BS7671 Electrical Installation Certificate and Building Regulations compliance certificate), including customer signatures, dates of installation and full address</li>
  <li>photographs taken at the time of installation demonstrating that the existing supply, distribution equipment, chargepoint cabling and installation meet&nbsp;<abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Failure to support this activity or provide information may result in your removal from the scheme. <abbr title="Office for Zero Emission Vehicles">OZEV</abbr>&nbsp;will seek to provide feedback on any installations audited.</p>

<h2>Enquiries</h2>

<p>Any queries relating to what your&nbsp;installer&nbsp;number is should be sent to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk">Authorisations@dvla.gov.uk</a>.</p>
