<h2>Routine vaccination update</h2>

<h3>Childhood diseases are making a comeback</h3>
<p>As we return to communities circulating and mixing at the same levels as pre-pandemic, we are seeing outbreaks of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (<abbr title="Respiratory Syncytial Virus">RSV</abbr>) and bronchitis, scarlet fever, chickenpox, hepatitis, and diphtheria. Not all these diseases circulating are vaccine preventable, but for those that are, vaccination is the best protection.</p>

<p>We also need herd protection for those too young or too unwell to be vaccinated. There are many reasons why families and individuals may have missed routine vaccination appointments or have not been able to respond to invitations. Lower vaccine coverage in meningococcal A, C, W and Y (<abbr title="Meningococcal A, C, W and Y">MenACWY</abbr>), measles, mumps and rubella 
(<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr>), pre-school and one-year boosters can lead to outbreaks of these diseases and we cannot afford to be complacent.</p>

<p>Dr Mary Ramsay, Director Public Health Programmes (including Immunisation), says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Families and young people should be encouraged to make routine vaccination a priority before summer travel or attending large events such as festivals.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Vaccine confidence â itâs not all about COVID-19</h3>

<p>Whilst the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programme has increased vaccine health literacy in our population, there is work to do to develop routine vaccine literacy and the importance of the protection that the national routine immunisation schedule provides for infants, children, young people and adults.</p>

<p>An important difference between pandemic vaccines for COVID-19 and vaccines within the national immunisation programme (apart from seasonal flu) is the provision of lifelong protection to help to reduce the burden of disease over a lifetime. Often it is the same underserved communities who have borne the highest burden of COVID-19 infection and mortality, who are at risk of the highest burden of these outbreaks. This places great importance on providing vaccination information tailored to these communityâs needs.</p>

<h3>Family vaccinations â convenience</h3>
<p>Providing families and individuals with invitations to appointments that are convenient is important. We have seen considerable success with vaccinations being offered in the evenings and at weekends, this can be very helpful for parents and carers unable to take time off work to attend.</p>

<p>Make every contact count by checking if children, young people and older adults are up-to-date with their routine vaccinations. We need GPs to vaccinate opportunistically and invite patients with incomplete vaccination histories.</p>

<p>Read on to see a range of resources to support vaccination conversations. It is very valuable to provide the accessible version of the leaflet â such as translated, large print, braille, British Sign Language (<abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr>), audio or Easy Read â with their invitation. Remember to check which language or accessible version of the leaflet would be best.</p>

<h2>Pregnant women</h2>
<p>Flu vaccination in season is offered to all pregnant women and in 2021 to 2022 provisional data (up to 28 February 2022) showed that over 244,000 pregnant women had received a vaccine.</p>

<p>Maternal vaccination against pertussis is needed for every pregnancy. It is important to offer vaccination at every visit to antenatal clinic, at scan, and day assessment.</p>

<p>This gives pregnant women an opportunity to discuss vaccination and the protection it helps to provide during pregnancy and for the baby after birth while they are too young to have their vaccinations.</p>

<p>Exposure to chickenpox, measles or rubella whilst pregnant can be very serious. <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination at one year and again at 3 years, 4 months provides the best protection and pregnant women who have not had their <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccines should be encouraged to have them once they have given birth to protect them and their infants until they are old enough to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthpublications.gov.uk/ViewArticle.html?sp=Squicklinksvaccinationforpregnantwomenposter" rel="external">quick links â vaccination for pregnant women poster</a> is available to download to signpost pregnant women to the COVID-19 guide and the âPregnancy your baby and youâ leaflet which explains pertussis and flu vaccination.</p>

<h2>
<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination</h2>

<h3>Those who have missed their <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination</h3>
<p>The recent European Immunization week news and events emphasised the importance of vaccines to protect people of all ages, and we are also reflecting on the drop in vaccine coverage. More than 1 in 10 eligible children under the age of 5 in England havenât had the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine or are only partially vaccinated.</p>

<p>This leaves these children unprotected and increases the risk of measles outbreaks occurring in nurseries and schools. We are reminding parents, carers or guardians to ensure their children are protected by taking up 2 doses of the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine at the right time.</p>

<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, there has been a significant drop in the number of parents and carers getting their children vaccinated against <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> and taking up other childhood vaccines.</p>

<p>Measles is highly contagious so even a small decline in <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> uptake can lead to a rise in cases. As international travel resumes, there is more chance for measles to be brought in from countries where it is common. Catching-up children who missed out on their <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccines during the pandemic is a priority to help prevent a rise in measles cases.</p>

<p>Vaccinations remain the best defence against infection, so it is very important that children attend their routine vaccination appointments and catch up on any they may have missed. You can see the updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/routine-childhood-immunisation-schedule">routine childhood schedule spring 2022</a> on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>Measles is a very contagious viral illness that used to be common in childhood but is now rare due to the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccination programme.</p>

<p>When you catch it, at first it can feel like you have a cold with a runny nose and a cough, sore red eyes (conjunctivitis) and a fever, but this is followed a few days later by a rash that spreads all over the body.</p>

<p>Most people will feel better after 7 to 10 days, however measles can lead to complications such as ear and chest infections, fits and diarrhoea and dehydration in younger children. On rare occasions measles can also lead to infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or brain itself (encephalitis) which can lead to long term disabilities or even death.</p>

<p>The first <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> dose is offered to infants when they turn one and the second dose to pre-school children when they are around 3 years and 4 months old.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine is the safest and most effective way to protect anyone against measles, mumps and rubella. Over 99% of those who have 2 doses of the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine will be protected against measles and rubella.</p>

<p>Since the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine was introduced in 1988, measles, mumps and rubella have become rare in the UK. However, outbreaks of disease, especially measles, have occurred when the number of people having the vaccine has dropped.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1968, 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been prevented in the UK. However, countries around the world with low <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine uptake continue to experience large measles outbreaks and epidemics.</p>

<h3>Travelling abroad this summer</h3>
<p>It is especially important to check you are up-to-date with your 2 doses of <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> before you travel. Not only would it be unpleasant to become ill whilst abroad, but you may risk bringing the infection back with you and exposing your family and friends.</p>

<p>Anyone who has not had 2 doses of the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine can contact their GP surgery to book an appointment. It is never too late to catch-up.</p>

<p>Itâs important to check youâve had both doses if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are about to start college or university</li>
  <li>are going to travel abroad</li>
  <li>are planning a pregnancy</li>
  <li>are a frontline health or social care worker</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why you should have the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine</h3>
<p>You should have the vaccine to protect yourself against 3 serious infections. By doing so you will also help to protect others who canât have the vaccine. These include unborn babies, infants who are too young to have the vaccine and children or adults who canât have the vaccine because they have weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>You should also have the vaccine if you work with young children or care for people as part of your work. Passing on measles to children who are too young to have the <abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine or to someone who is already ill, can have very serious consequences for their health.</p>

<h2>Chickenpox exposures in pregnant women</h2>

<p>As people have begun to mix more widely, it is inevitable that cases of infectious diseases are on the rise.</p>

<p>Typically, rates of chickenpox infections are highest between the months of March and May. Chickenpox infection is most common in young children, for whom the disease is normally mild. However, certain groups are at risk of severe or even life-threatening disease and therefore should be offered post-exposure treatment if they are susceptible at the time of exposure.</p>

<p>Pregnant women with no previous history of infection or vaccination, immunosuppressed individuals, and neonates in the first week of life (whose mothers are not immune) should be risk assessed to determine if they require post-exposure treatment with either anti-viral medication or varicella zoster immunoglobulin (<abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr>).</p>

<p>After reviews of the effectiveness of antivirals and <abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr> in prevention of chickenpox, antiviral medication is now the post-exposure treatment of choice for all immunosuppressed patients and pregnant women, regardless of stage in pregnancy.</p>

<p>The only group of individuals where <abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr> is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis (<abbr title="post exposure prophylaxis">PEP</abbr>) is those neonates exposed within one week of delivery, either in utero from maternal infection or post-delivery.</p>

<p>The recommend doses of anti-virals are given in the table below, with treatment starting from day 7 after onset of infection or day of exposure. Further doses of antivirals can be given if there is a second or later exposure.</p>

<p><abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr> will only be issued for susceptible neonates exposed within one week of birth (either in utero from maternal infection, or post-delivery) or if oral antivirals are contraindicated due to malabsorption, renal toxicity, or because the patient is less than 4 weeks of age.</p>

<p>If required, <abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr> needs to be given within 7 days of contact (immunosuppressed) or within 10 days (pregnant women and neonates) and can be arranged by contacting the Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service (<abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr>) at the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) on 0330 128 1020 between 9am and 5:30pm, 7 days a week. <abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr> will not be issued outside these hours.</p>

<p>Prior to calling, please make sure you have the following information available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demographic details of the patient (name, date of birth, NHS number)</li>
  <li>any history of chickenpox/shingles infection or vaccination</li>
  <li>date, type, and duration of exposure</li>
  <li>quantitative varicella zoster (<abbr title="varicella zoster">VZ</abbr>) antibody level (mIU/ml)</li>
  <li>reason why antivirals are contraindicated</li>
  <li>details of the healthcare practitioner who will administer the <abbr title="varicella zoster immunoglobulin">VZIG</abbr>
</li>

<h2>Rabies</h2>

<h3>Rabies-like viruses in bats in the UK</h3>

<p>Even in this country, those steps to prevent rabies are not always well understood. Whilst we donât have rabies in terrestrial animals in the UK, risks do exist from contact with bats. Rabies-like viruses (bat lyssaviruses) can be found in many countries around the world, including in the UK.</p>

<p>There is a passive surveillance program of dead bats for lyssaviruses in the UK, and this year alone lyssaviruses have been identified in 4 bats. As rabies can be passed on to people through a bat bite, scratch or contact with the batâs saliva, it is therefore important that all bat bites, scratches or other exposures, whether in the UK or abroad, should be assessed promptly by a health professional so that they can arrange rabies post-exposure treatment if needed.</p>

<p>This time of year, as the evenings are becoming longer and weather is getting warmer, bats have mainly come out of hibernation and are hungry and active. It is a perfect time for spotting bats. However, if the nights are cold they may become cool and inactive again. Bat bites can occur if someone handles a bat without wearing appropriate protective gloves, so never pick up a bat with bare hands, even if it appears inactive. Bat bites in the UK are felt rather than seen and may not always bleed or leave an obvious mark on the skin.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> has developed a leaflet for the public and health professionals explaining the rabies risks from bat contact. This covers what people should do if they find an injured or grounded bat as well as what to do if they come into contact with a bat. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-risks-from-bat-bites">Further information</a> is available and copies of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthpublications.gov.uk/ViewArticle.html?sp=Sbatcontactandrabiesriskleaflet-484" rel="external">leaflet can be ordered</a> through the Health Publications website.</p>

<p>Patients with confirmed or suspected contact with a bat should be started on a course of rabies vaccines, which should be available in all NHS Trusts, and the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> team based at Colindale contacted during working hours to arrange the rest of the course of treatment. Any rabies vaccine used locally for post-exposure treatment will be replaced, provided <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> is notified by the end of the next working day.</p>

<h3>Actions following an animal bite anywhere in the world</h3>
<p>If someone is bitten, scratched or licked by any animal, they should immediately wash and thoroughly flush the area with soap and lots of water. Medical attention should be sought locally and travellers overseas should not wait until they return to the UK to start a course of rabies post-exposure treatment if it is required.</p>

<p>For some animal bites, a course of antibiotics may be required and for puncture wounds an assessment of their tetanus risk should be undertaken with a tetanus booster if indicated.</p>

<p>Information on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-risks-by-country">country risk for rabies</a> and the need for rabies post-exposure treatment is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Overseas travellers</h3>
<p>After the lockdowns last year, more people are beginning to travel overseas again, and it is important that all travellers check whether rabies is present in the place they are visiting. This information can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries" rel="external">TravelHealthPro country information pages</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-exposure rabies vaccination may be appropriate for some travellers depending on where they are travelling to and what activities they will be doing there. Further information is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-the-green-book-chapter-27">Green Book</a>.</p>

<p>Travellers should be reminded to avoid contact with animals while they are abroad. They should be advised not to touch, feed or pat wild or domestic animals, even within temples, zoos or sanctuaries. Children are at greatest risk of exposure to rabies as they are more likely to touch animals and may not then tell their parents or guardians.</p>

<p>A leaflet with further advice for overseas travellers can be ordered for GP surgeries, hospitals, travel clinics or other locations through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthpublications.gov.uk/ViewArticle.html?sp=Sbatcontactandrabiesriskleaflet-484" rel="external">Health Publications website</a>.</p>

<h3>Rabies guidelines and advice</h3>
<p>Updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-post-exposure-prophylaxis-management-guidelines">guidelines on managing rabies post-exposure treatment</a> was published by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> in September 2021.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Rabies and Immunoglobulin Service">RIgS</abbr> team is based in <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>âs National Infection Service at Colindale and is available to assist health professionals with enquiries and rabies post-exposure risk assessments between 9am and 7pm on 0330 128 1020.</p>

<p>Outside of these hours, if there is a potential rabies exposure, patients should be started on a course of rabies vaccine.</p>

<p>Rabies vaccine should be available in all trusts in England for prompt initiation of post-exposure treatment if needed (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rabies-post-exposure-prophylaxis-management-guidelines">Letter to A&amp;E consultants and pharmacists: important information regarding rabies post-exposure treatment</a>.</p>

<h2>Health Publications survey</h2>

<p>The aim of this exploratory study is to gather insights into how healthcare practitioners currently experience using the healthpublications.gov.uk website and service or what they might expect from this website.</p>

<p>Should you agree to join this study, you will be asked to respond to a few general questions concerning publications search and the overall use of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.healthpublications.gov.uk/Home.html" rel="external">Health Publications</a> website. After this, at the end of the survey, you will be asked to complete one task on the Health Publications website and answer additional usability-related questions.</p>

<p>Finally, optionally, you will be asked to leave your email address should you wish to join future user tests. Please note, there will not be any difficult questions, we just want to understand what you think about the service and how it could be improved.</p>

<p>It will not require any special preparation, just your honest thoughts. This will help us to improve the service to support the recovery of the national immunisation programme.</p>

<h3>Availability of VaxelisÂ® vaccine as an alternative to Infanrix hexaÂ®</h3>
<p>Since 31 January 2022, as part of the current vaccination programme, VaxelisÂ® has been available to order via ImmForm. VaxelisÂ® is an alternative hexavalent vaccine to Infanrix hexaÂ® (<abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>) for routine infant primary immunisations scheduled at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age. Vaxelis protects against the same 6 diseases as Infanrix hexaÂ® and has been licensed in Europe for more than 5 years.</p>

<p>Infanrix hexaÂ® will also continue to be available via ImmForm.</p>

<p>VaxelisÂ® and Infanrix hexaÂ® vaccines are interchangeable, but where possible and if local stock allows, it is preferable that the same <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr>-containing vaccine be used for all 3 doses of the primary course. However, vaccination should never be delayed because the vaccine used for previous doses is not known or unavailable.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hexavalent-vaccine-dtapipvhibhepb-infanrix-hexa-pgd-template">hexavalent vaccine <abbr title="diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis/inactivated polio/haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B">DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB</abbr> Patient Group Direction (<abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr>) national template</a> (version 03.00, valid from 1 September 2021) includes use of both Infanrix hexaÂ® and VaxelisÂ®.</p>

<p>Ordering controls for VaxelisÂ® will be in place to balance incoming supply with demand. Customers in England and Wales may order up to 10 packs of VaxelisÂ® per ImmForm account per week. Orders for Infanrix hexaÂ® remain unrestricted. Customers in Scotland should refer to their local ordering restrictions. Providers should not order more than 2 weeksâ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures.</p>

<p>Further details can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/12264/smpc" rel="external">VaxelisÂ® Summary of Product Characteristics</a> â Vaxelis suspension for injection in pre-filled syringe.</p>

<h3>Supply of vaccines with reduced shelf life</h3>
<p>Vaccines supplied via ImmForm for the routine immunisation programme will usually have at least 3 months of shelf-life remaining at the time of delivery. To help reduce wastage, vaccines with reduced shelf life will occasionally be supplied. ImmForm customers will be informed of vaccines which have reduced shelf life via ImmForm news articles, updates on the particular ImmForm product page, or a click-thru pop-up message at the time of ordering.</p>

<p>ImmForm customers should order no more than 2 weeksâ worth of stock to minimise wastage due to fridge failures or failure to use stock before expiry. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/storage-distribution-and-disposal-of-vaccines-the-green-book-chapter-3">chapter 3 of the âGreen Bookâ (Immunisation against infectious disease)</a> for further details on the storage and supply of vaccines.</p>

<p>To minimise wastage, please use all locally held stocks of in-date VIPERFAVÂ® to treat eligible patients, before switching to ViperaTAbÂ®.</p>

<h3>Update to Bexsero Patient Information Leaflet</h3>
<p>Every pack of Bexsero (Meningitis B vaccine; 10 doses) is supplied with a pad of 10 Patient Information Leaflets (<abbr title="Patient Information Leaflets">PILs</abbr>), as well as there being a single <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> inside each Bexsero pack. Since September 2020, an updated version of the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> pad has been distributed with Bexsero orders. Please dispose of the single <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> from inside the pack, as it will be out-of-date.</p>

<p>We will advise further when the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> supplied in the pack is in line with the <abbr title="Patient Information Leaflet">PIL</abbr> pad.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="measles, mumps and rubella">MMR</abbr> vaccine ordering</h3>

<p>Customers in England and Wales who require PriorixÂ®, for example because you serve communities that do not accept vaccines containing porcine gelatine, may order up to 6 packs of PriorixÂ® per ImmForm account per week.</p>

<p>For assistance please contact the ImmForm Helpdesk at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:helpdesk@immform.org.uk">helpdesk@immform.org.uk</a>. Customers in Scotland should refer to their local ordering restrictions.</p>

<p>Please note that Movianto UK drivers delivering centrally supplied products are not able to phone a delivery point upon arrival at the delivery location. Customers are expected to make arrangements ahead of the scheduled delivery day to receive their deliveries.</p>

<h3>ImmForm customers should report long-term changes to opening hours for deliveries</h3>
<p>Customers should report long-term changes to the days and times when they can accept deliveries, such as routine training days and closures, by contacting Movianto UK Customer Care (<a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:MoviantoUK.NHSCC@movianto.com">MoviantoUK.NHSCC@movianto.com</a>; 01234 587207).

<h3>The EU Falsified Medicines Directive (<abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>) and Delegated Regulation as applicable to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>-supplied vaccines for the national immunisation programme</h3>
<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2016-11/dir_2011_62_en_0.pdf" rel="external">EU Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU (<abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>)</a> and Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2016/161) (The Delegated Regulation) impose legal obligations on the EU medicines supply chain to prevent entry of falsified medicinal products into the supply chain.</p>

<p>The Delegated Regulation was implemented in all EU Member States on 9 February 2019. Following the UKâs departure from the EU, the Delegated Regulation ceased to apply in Great Britain from 31 December 2020, but continues to apply in Northern Ireland.</p>

<h3>Information for customers in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p><abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>-barcoded packs of routine immunisation programme vaccines that are centrally supplied by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> continue to be supplied with active <abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr> serialisation, and should be decommissioned by end users in Northern Ireland. Customers in Northern Ireland who access centrally supplied vaccines are encouraged to review local guidance on implementation of the EU Falsified Medicines Directive.</p>

<p>To date, COVID-19 vaccines have so far been exempt from the requirements of <abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr>, however <abbr title="Falsified Medicines Directive">FMD</abbr> compliant packs are in place for Moderna (now named Spikevax) COVID-19 vaccine batch 3005688 with expiry date 14 February 2022.
