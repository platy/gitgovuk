<h2>Main changes to the previous version</h2>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changes to daily contact testing advice</li>
  <li>the rollout of testing to primary school staff</li>
  <li>further guidance on the different approaches to testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is for leaders and others involved in the asymptomatic testing programme in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special academies</li>
  <li>maintained special schools</li>
  <li>alternative provision (<abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>) academies, including hospital schools</li>
  <li>registered independent <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr>, including hospital schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units (PRUs)</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions</li>
  <li>non-maintained special schools</li>
  <li>independent special schools</li>
</ul>

<p>This guidance may also be useful for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>local authorities</li>
  <li>clinical commissioning groups</li>
  <li>community health staff working with children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (<abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Parents and carers of children and young people in the settings in this list may also find this guidance helpful.</p>

<p>This guidance supplements the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges">mass asymptomatic testing for schools and colleges</a>, recognising that there are distinct issues for settings in the special school, specialist college and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> sectors. It is part of guidance and resources for schools and colleges to support preparations for coronavirus (COVID-19) asymptomatic testing in education settings.</p>

<h2>Importance of testing secondary age pupils and students</h2>

<p>It is crucial that action continues to be taken to break the chains of transmission of the virus and safeguard the health of the staff of education settings and their pupils and students wherever face-to-face education occurs.</p>

<p>Settings will have received an initial delivery of lateral flow device test kits to support asymptomatic testing from the start of the spring term.</p>

<p>Up to one-third of people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic. By rapidly identifying and containing any asymptomatic cases, we can reduce the spread of transmission. Testing does not replace existing protective measures such as handwashing, and settings should continue to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings#the-system-of-controls-protective-measures" class="govuk-link">system of controls</a>.</p>

<p>Settings should not make it a requirement to have been tested in order to attend their setting. Testing is voluntary and no child or young person will be tested unless informed consent has been given by the appropriate person and the child and young person is willing to be tested. If assisted swabbing is required, the willingness and feasibility to swab should be reviewed and risk-assessed every time before swabbing. Further guidance is available in the <a href="#consent" class="govuk-link">informed consent to testing</a> section.</p>

<p>However, we strongly encourage all children and young people who are receiving face-to-face education to have the test, wherever it is possible to do so, to help identify asymptomatic positive cases and support appropriate self-isolation to break the chain of transmission.</p>

<p>Testing is similarly voluntary for members of staff and they are encouraged to participate.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been extremely challenging for many families of children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>. Supporting them is a priority for this government and their wellbeing remains central to our response.</p>

<p>We recognise that settings in the special school, special post-16 institution and <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> sectors are diverse and there will be a wide range of challenges in delivering effective testing to their pupils and students. This guidance, which has been drawn up with the help of representatives of these sectors, is intended to give leaders in these settings a framework within which they can devise and deliver an approach that is effective in their particular context.</p>

<p>This testing is only for people without symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). Those with symptoms should follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">book a test</a>.</p>

<h2>Working with children and young people and their parents</h2>

<p>We recognise that self-swabbing may cause significant concerns for some children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>. Some of these concerns may be alleviated by discussing them with the child or young person and their family, agreeing strategies to help reduce anxiety and putting in place any reasonable adjustments (if the individual has a disability). There may for example be a set of simple, practical steps that the settingâs staff and parents can co-produce to smooth the testing process.</p>

<p>With careful and sensitive management, we are confident that the asymptomatic testing programme can be rolled out to most children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>. However, where this is not the case, it is crucial that there is no disadvantage to their education.</p>

<p>Testing technology is developing all the time. We are continuing to work proactively on other approaches to testing for children and young people who are unable to self-administer a throat or nasal swab.</p>

<h2>The staff, children and young people who are eligible for testing</h2>

<p>Settings are encouraged to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>test staff on a twice-weekly basis, with tests 3 to 4 days apart</li>
  <li>offer one-off testing (only to those who have yet to return to their institution) of pupils and students of secondary school age and those aged 19 to 25 with education, health and care (EHC) plans when they return to their setting</li>
</ul>

<p>Any staff working on a settingâs site can be offered lateral flow device (LFD) tests at the settingâs discretion. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teachers</li>
  <li>teaching assistants</li>
  <li>clinical staff employed by the school</li>
  <li>other support staff (including therapists)</li>
  <li>those involved in cleaning testing sites</li>
</ul>

<p>Settings can offer others testing too, for example, school nurses or drivers or escorts, liaising as appropriate with both the individuals and their employers. Some staff, particularly those employed through the NHS, may have separate arrangements for regular testing. Testing should be offered and undertaken in line with the standard operating procedure and the how to guide on the secure digital platform.</p>

<p>Where a child or young person routinely attends more than one setting on a part-time basis, for example, because they are dual registered at a mainstream school and an <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> setting or special school, those settings should work together to determine where the pupil should receive the testing and share the outcomes of the testing with the other settings. However, as a general guide, we would usually expect the setting where the pupil spends most of their time to take responsibility for the administration of the testing.</p>

<p>Schools or local authorities that commission placements in unregistered <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> (any <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> setting that is not a pupil referral unit, an <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> academy, an <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> free school, or a registered independent school) should aim to ensure pupils accessing this provision are offered testing, for example via the mainstream school who commissioned the place or working with the local authority to identify appropriate testing if the local authority commissioned the place. They should assure themselves that any unregistered <abbr title="alternative provision">AP</abbr> they commission have taken appropriate steps to ensure their institutions are following suitable coronavirus (COVID-19) protective measures.</p>

<p>Primary aged pupils should not be offered testing. Further announcements will be made for testing other age groups in due course.</p>

<h3>All through specialist settings</h3>

<p>Settings which are all-through should have received sufficient test kits to test their entire workforce as part of the secondary schools and colleges rollout. They should follow the guidance on testing in the how to guide on the secure digital platform.</p>

<p>These settings should not expect an additional delivery of test kits for their primary teaching workforce as sufficient test kits should have already been provided.</p>

<p>If an all through school does receive a delivery of primary test kits they are advised not to open them and to <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Primary specialist settings</h3>

<p>Primary specialist settings should follow the guidance on testing their staff on the secure digital platform.</p>

<h2>Different approaches to testing</h2>

<p>Settings may want to consider updating risk assessments to understand which of their pupils or students are unlikely to be able to self-swab and therefore are likely to require additional support or reasonable adjustments, if they are disabled, to be put in place. The standard operating procedures available on the secure digital platform provides guidance on ensuring risks are identified, recorded and managed.</p>

<p>Self-swabbing should be supervised. In some cases, the individual may wish to have a particular trusted adult from the setting to supervise the self-swab of the test. The setting may also wish to consider whether it would agree in exceptional circumstances to a parent coming into the setting to support their child to self-swab or to swab their child. This might be a reasonable adjustment for the testing of a child or young person with a disability, for example. Settings will need to put in place suitable measures to manage the infection risk to staff and other children and young people of a parent being present.</p>

<p>We recognise that self-swabbing may not be possible for a wide range of children and young people with <abbr title="special educational needs and disabilities">SEND</abbr>, for example, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they lack the fine motor skills to do so</li>
  <li>the process of their inserting the swab into the mouth and nostrils would cause great anxiety (because, for example, they have an aversion to such touch or they are not comfortable with a gagging reflex)</li>
  <li>their level of learning difficulty affects their ability to fully understand, and therefore co-operate with, the testing process</li>
  <li>the child or young person has medical needs such that this process would present a disproportionate risk given the benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>Assisted swabbing (such as performing the swab for someone who is unable to self-swab) does not need to be done by a clinician. Special schools and special post-16 institutions already have a range of staff to meet the health needs of children and young people. These staff members have undertaken a variety of training to support health needs and it might be appropriate for them to swab individuals who cannot self-swab, once they are confident in doing so and familiarised with how to perform assisted swabbing via the training detailed in the training guide on the secure digital platform.</p>

<p>Those assisting with swabs should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and read the PPE guidance on the secure digital platform.</p>

<p>Settings will wish to assess risks when considering whether it is appropriate for a parent to swab their child when other options are not possible, and what mitigations should be put in place in that eventuality.</p>

<p>If a parent is to swab their child, then the setting should consider providing them with guidance on swabbing as they would do for those self-swabbing and the parent should be supervised by a person appropriately trained to supervise swabbing.</p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, schools or special post-16 institutions may not have enough staff to undertake assisted swabbing, for example, due to staff absence. In these instances, additional capacity for assisted swabbing may be available. <a href="#contact" class="govuk-link">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Where possible a combined nose and throat swab should be taken. However, a person-centred approach should be used to assess which sample to take from each child or young person. A child or young person may find it difficult to take a throat swab due to their having difficulty in understanding instructions, needing to keep their mouth open during the period of swabbing or they are having a strong gag reflex. In such cases, where a combined nose and throat swab is not possible, a nose swab from both nostrils can be taken. Similarly, if for some reason a nasal swab is not feasible, a throat swab alone will suffice.</p>

<p>Swabbing should be carried out in line with the standard operating procedure which is available on the secure digital platform.</p>

<h4>Example from a school who have implemented asymptomatic testing successfully</h4>

<p>Castle Hill High School in Stockport is a secondary special school with 300 pupils on roll. The school caters for a range of SEN, including moderate learning difficulties, autism, social, emotional and mental health difficulties, and severe learning difficulties.</p>

<p>They have implemented asymptomatic testing successfully. This involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying a medium-sized room to be used exclusively for testing</li>
  <li>the head and deputy head doing the online training</li>
  <li>a team of 4 non-teaching members of staff volunteering to create a dedicated team to deliver the testing system for pupils - they received initial training from the head and deputy head followed by the online training modules</li>
  <li>one member of the team doing the paperwork, one collecting each pupil when their time is ready to be tested and ensuring they are registered, one demonstrating to the pupil how to do the test or assisting the pupil with the test and the final member of the team doing the test analysis and recording</li>
  <li>the deputy head overseeing the testing</li>
</ul>

<p>When assisting pupils with swabbing, the team reports that it has been straightforward. Older, more confident, pupils tend to self-swab.</p>

<p>Some pupils have been nervous, but this has been easily overcome. All pupils were shown a video of the process and told what to expect prior to their first routine test.</p>

<h2>Informed consent to testing</h2>

<p>Testing is voluntary, but those who are eligible for tests are strongly encouraged to participate to reduce the risk of transmission within schools and colleges.</p>

<p>The person giving the consent (parent or legal guardian or the young person) needs to have a sound understanding of the risks and benefits of testing. The setting is responsible for communicating the purpose of the testing.</p>

<p>Even if the child or young person or the parent or legal guardian has given consent, if the individual at any point is not willing to participate in testing then that choice should be respected.</p>

<p>Young people aged 16 or over do not need parental or legal guardian consent provided that they are able to make the decision for themselves. However, the setting will need to decide whether the young person can reasonably provide informed consent themselves and may exceptionally need to consider undertaking a mental capacity assessment (<abbr title="mental capacity assessment">MCA</abbr>). Young people themselves should be given the opportunity to express their views and preferences to the extent that they are able. Settings should keep a record of how the decision on consent was made. There is further guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-looking-after-people-who-lack-mental-capacity/the-mental-capacity-act-2005-mca-and-deprivation-of-liberty-safeguards-dols-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-additional-guidancea" class="govuk-link">Mental Capacity Act 2005 and deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) during the coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> outbreak.</p>

<p>It is important that the willingness of the child or young person and the risk posed to them and the staff or parent assisting the test is always considered. The school or special post-16 institution should exercise due care and judgement and, in appropriate circumstances, may choose not to test a child or young person, even when consent has been given. Settings should not make it a requirement to have been tested in order to attend.</p>

<p>For a looked after child or young person in local authority care, such as those from childrenâs homes, including secure settings, or some pupils in residential special schools, individuals would need to agree to be tested, where age-appropriate. Where parental consent is required this would need to be secured through the childâs or young personâs social worker unless existing arrangements are in place which covers this.</p>

<p>For a looked after child or young person from a fostering or kinship care household, in most circumstances local authority (via a social worker) or birth family consent would be required to allow foster or kinship carers or schools and colleges to assist swabbing.</p>

<h2>Safeguarding</h2>

<p>Schools and colleges must comply with their legal duties as appropriate regarding pre-appointment checks when utilising agency staff, contractors and volunteers to support testing schools and colleges, including having regard to the statutory safeguarding guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2">keeping children safe in education</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-best-practice-in-colleges">safeguarding in colleges</a>.</p>

<h2>Managing the anxiety of pupils and students</h2>

<p>School and college staff know the children and young people in their settings well and will be able to put in place an approach that helps reduce any anxiety as much as possible. They will also need to consider whether there are reasonable adjustments that they would need to make to the context in which the tests were conducted for disabled children and young people while maintaining the integrity of the testing process.</p>

<p>Where a setting has concerns about the anxiety levels of a child or young person, it will often be helpful to talk the issues through with them and their parents.</p>

<h3>Areas staff may wish to consider</h3>

<p>These questions are based on feedback from the sector.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can staff help ensure that the child or young person knows what is involved and the reasons for it? What methods of communication work best for them?</li>
  <li>How can parents help their child know what testing will involve and what advice can they provide to the setting as to what might work best?</li>
  <li>Would it be helpful by exception for a parent, with appropriate measures in place to manage infection risk, to accompany the pupil or student as they self-swab when taking the test, or to assist their swabbing during the test? For more information, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#variants">different approaches to testing</a>
</li>
  <li>Would it be helpful to have someone on the staff who has a good relationship with the child or young person present during the testing?</li>
  <li>Would it be helpful for the child or young person to be familiarised with the site to be used for testing and how it will be set up?</li>
  <li>How can the site being used for testing be made as calm an environment as possible?</li>
  <li>Will it help to offer the child or young person a relaxing activity after testing or refreshments to help make it as positive an experience as possible?</li>
  <li>If the child or young person stims to relieve their anxiety, then will it help to allow them to have their stimming toy with them throughout the test?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Practicalities of testing</h2>

<p>We recognise that some settings may not have rooms that meet the requirements set out in the how to guide on the secure digital platform, for example, because otherwise suitable rooms have a carpet or other porous floor covering. Settings are encouraged to be pragmatic. We have provided additional funding that can be used to help equip rooms for these purposes.</p>

<p>Guidance on managing the testing process is available on the secure digital platform, including how to register the tests. A school or college may additionally wish to record when a child or young person has required assistance with swabbing and a parent or member of staff has assisted or performed the swabbing, in order to comply with any school and college insurance requirements.</p>

<h3>Financial and workforce support</h3>

<p>We will support schools and colleges with the costs of testing. Funding will be paid retrospectively. We expect the main cost incurred to be workforce costs, but schools and colleges will have the discretion to spend this in order to meet other reasonable testing costs.</p>

<p>We have accounted for different staffing levels needed in special schools, APs and specialist colleges to deliver testing. Non-maintained special schools and independent special schools will also receive funding to support them with testing costs.</p>

<p>In the exceptional circumstances where schools or special post-16 institutions may not have the capacity to deliver assisted swabbing (due to, for example, staff sickness) then further support may be available. <a href="#contact" class="govuk-link">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Residential special schools and special post-16 institutions</h3>

<p>The guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe">safe working in education, childcare and childrenâs social care settings</a> includes the actions to be taken in the event of a child or young person being tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Further information on what to do if a child or young person tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) using a lateral flow device (LFD) can be found within the how to guide on the secure digital platform.</p>

<p>Due to the high prevalence of coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in England, the government is temporarily removing confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) testing for LFD tests taken at test sites, such as those situated in some workplaces, universities, secondary schools and colleges. This follows advice from Public Health England that, when coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence rates are high, the performance of lateral flow devices and PCRs are broadly comparable when used at testing sites with systematic operating procedures, significantly reducing the need for routine confirmatory testing.</p>

<h3>Transport</h3>

<p>Where a child or young person has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), they need to be sent home. The setting should contact the parent or carer who should make arrangements for the child or young person to journey home as soon as possible. They may walk or cycle if it is possible for them to do so and they are able to wear a face covering and keep a safe distance from others. They must not travel on public transport. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible for the parent or carer to make arrangements for the childâs or young personâs journey home, home to school transport may be provided.</p>

<p>Further information on what to do if a pupil or student tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) using a lateral flow device can be found in the how to guide on the secure digital platform. Those affected should self-isolate immediately and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection</a>.</p>
