<p><strong>How to use this factsheet:</strong></p>
</div>

<p>This factsheet is for tied pub tenants who want to know more about the Market Rent Only (MRO) option and their related rights under the Pubs Code.</p>

<p>It provides information to support tenant understanding. It is not a substitute for the Pubs Code legal framework.</p>

<p>Our <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/pca">website</a> also contains other useful information about accessing your Pubs Code rights, including the PCA’s published advice on Code matters.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Check this factsheet is right for you:</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The Pubs Code was amended from 1 April 2022, including changes to the MRO procedure.</p>

<p>The MRO procedure in this factsheet applies if the MRO event happened 1 April 2022 onwards.</p>

<p>If the event happened before 1 April 2022, you should read the PCA’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/market-rent-only-mro-rights">factsheet</a> on the MRO procedure for events before 1 April 2022.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Part 5 of the Pubs Code</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>What is the MRO Option?</h2>

<p>The MRO option is the right for you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>choose to occupy the tied pub under a <strong>tenancy that is MRO-compliant</strong> - see section: What is a MRO-compliant tenancy?</li>
</ul>

<p>and pay either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>rent agreed</strong> between you and the POB in line with the MRO procedure; or</li>
  <li>the <strong>market rent</strong> (if you cannot agree the rent)</li>
</ul>

<p>The MRO option is also known as the choice to go <strong>‘free of tie’</strong>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>When can I ask for the MRO Option?</h2>

<p>There are <strong>four</strong> circumstances under the Pubs Code where you can ask for the MRO option. The Code calls these <strong>MRO events</strong> (also known as MRO gateways).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>You receive a rent assessment proposal</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Pubs Code - Regulation 27</p>
</div>

<p>A Rent Assessment Proposal (RAP) is the document in which the POB proposes and explains the new rent you will pay in relation to your existing tenancy. When you receive a RAP, this starts the rent assessment (or assessment of money payable instead of rent).</p>

<p>The <strong>MRO event occurs</strong> when you receive the RAP.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A RAP is different to a rent proposal.</p>
</div>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>For more information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Rent assessments</strong> (including when the POB must send you a RAP and the difference between this and a rent proposal) see the PCA’s factsheet: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rent-assessments-and-rent-assessment-proposals">What Tied Pub Tenants Need to Know – Rent Assessments and Rent Assessment Proposals</a>

</li>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Renewal of your pub arrangement (e.g. your tenancy)</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Pubs Code - Regulation 26</p>
</div>

<p>Your pub arrangement is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tenancy under which you occupy the tied pub; and</li>
  <li>any other contractual agreement, which includes an obligation that the landlord supplies some or all the alcohol to be sold at the premises<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The MRO event occurs when your pub arrangement (e.g. your tenancy) is renewed.</p>

<p><strong>When is my tenancy renewed?</strong></p>

<p>For a MRO event, the Code treats renewal of a tenancy as the first day the tenancy may be renewed under its terms. This applies unless it is a protected tenancy under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (“1954 Act”).</p>

<p>A protected tenancy generally gives you the right to occupy the premises after the lease expires, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>

<p>If you have a <strong>protected tenancy</strong> under the 1954 Act, the Code treats renewal of the tenancy as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the day you receive the POB’s notice under section 25(1) of the 1954 Act, proposing to end the tenancy; or</li>
  <li>the day the landlord receives your request under section 26 of the 1954 Act for a new tenancy</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>If the MRO event is the renewal of your pub arrangement or you have received a RAP, you cannot send a MRO notice if the investment exception applies.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

</div>

<p>The <strong>MRO event occurs</strong> when you receive the invoice that shows there has been a significant increase in the price at which a tied product or tied service is supplied to you. Once you receive the invoice, you are treated as having been notified.</p>

<p>An increase must meet specific requirements for it to amount to a <strong>significant increase in price</strong>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.4 </span>You send a relevant analysis to the POB which demonstrates that a trigger event has occurred that will have a significant impact on trade</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Pubs Code - Regulation 25</p>
</div>

<p>To show there has been a trigger event you must send the POB a written analysis of the forecasted level of trading in each month from the day the trigger event occurred to at least 12 months later. This is your <strong>relevant analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>You have <strong>56 days</strong> to send your relevant analysis to the POB, starting the day after the trigger event.</p>

<p>The <strong>MRO event occurs</strong> when you send your relevant analysis to the POB.</p>

<p>When something happens that will affect trade, it must meet specific requirements for it to amount to a <strong>trigger event</strong>.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>MRO Procedure</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>See Parts 5 and 6 of the Pubs Code</p>
</div>

<p>The Pubs Code sets the procedure to be followed in connection with the offer of a market rent only option. This is the <strong>MRO Procedure</strong>.</p>

<p>It is important to note in this factsheet the circumstances under which the MRO procedure will end. When this happens, you can no longer continue with the MRO option in connection with that particular MRO notice (unless it has ended because you have entered into a MRO tenancy).</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>How do I ask for the MRO Option?</h2>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">

</div>

<p>You must first notify the POB that you want it to offer you the MRO option. This is your MRO notice.</p>

<p>Your MRO notice must be in writing.</p>

<p>You can find a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pubs-code-market-rent-only">template MRO notice</a> on our website.</p>
