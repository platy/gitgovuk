<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: pupil premium reporting</h2>

<p>In October 2021 we set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools">PE and sport premium guidance</a> an intention to monitor compliance with the requirement to publish PE and sport premium reports online. Over the past academic year, DfE officials have been checking compliance of a randomised representative sample of schools. We have recently written to those schools from this sample where we have identified no online report has been published.</p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to remind all schools in receipt of the PE and sport premium that reports must be published by 31 July 2022 for the 2021 to 22 academic year. Further details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools">what must be included in your report</a> can be found on GOV.UK. If you choose to, you can use the recommended reporting template produced by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.afpe.org.uk/physical-education/evidencing-the-impact-guidance-template/" rel="external">Association for PE</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/resources/primary-pe-sport-premium" rel="external">Youth Sport Trust</a>. DfE officials will commence checks of PE and sport premium reports for the 2021 to 2022 academic year shortly after 31 July.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: announcement of the next round of schools selected for the School Rebuilding Programme (SRP)</h2>

<p>On Tuesday 12 July, we announced the next group of schools which will have buildings replaced or refurbished as part of the School Rebuilding Programme. The programme addresses buildings in the worst condition across England. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme/school-rebuilding-programme">A list of the schools and further information</a> is available  on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The School Rebuilding Programme is a 10-year programme that was announced by the Prime Minister in 2020. It is carrying out major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at 500 schools and sixth-form colleges across England, prioritised according to condition need. Investing in our school buildings is vital to support schools and teachers in delivering high-quality education, so that pupils gain the knowledge, skills and qualifications they need to succeed.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, we expect to prioritise up to 300 schools in total. We are announcing a smaller group of schools now to maintain the pace of delivery and address some of the poorest condition buildings as soon as possible. We are still assessing all other nominations received and have not ruled out any nominated school at this point. We plan to make another announcement later this year to confirm further schools selected.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: IFRS 16 leases - delay to new lease approvals approach</h2>

<p>In March, we provided information about changes to the departmentâs approach to leasing following the implementation of IFRS 16 leases (subject to the outcome of the CIPFA consultation).</p>

<p>Once IFRS 16 is adopted, the distinction between operating and finance leases will end which could radically increase the number of leases requiring Secretary of State consent as they will become the equivalent of a finance lease and generate borrowing. We want to continue to allow local authority-maintained schools and academies to use leases to support their operation, maintaining the status quo without additional administrative burdens. Therefore, the new approach involves creating a General Consent Order, for particular classes of leased asset (formerly accounted for as operating leases).</p>

<p>Whilst academies will not be adopting IFRS 16, to ensure parity across the sector, the new lease approvals approach will also apply to academies.</p>

<p>As you will be aware, implementation of IFRS 16 Leases is delayed for local authorities until 1 April 2024, although they can adopt earlier should they wish to. We are therefore postponing implementation of the new lease approvals approach for both local authority-maintained schools and academies.</p>

<p>Please continue to adhere to the terms set out in the Education Act 2002 until IFRS 16 leases is adopted by your local authority.</p>

<p>If you have already adopted the standard or are considering adopting it earlier than 1 April 2024, please do let us know by sending an email to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:IFRS16.ENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk">IFRS16.ENQUIRIES@education.gov.uk</a> by 21st July 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: change to payment dates from August 2022</h2>

<p>From August 2022 we are combining the payment dates for the grant funded adult programmes and 16 to 19 funding. Currently adult grants are paid on the 14th working day and they will move to the 18th calendar day or first working day prior.</p>

<ul>
  <li>adult education budget (grant funded)</li>
  <li>advance learner loans bursary (grant funded)</li>
</ul>

<p>In August 2022, payments will reach bank accounts on the same date (18 August), however, in September adult grant funding will paid on 16 September instead of 20 September.</p>

<p>If you are in receipt of both adult funding and 16 to 19 funding these will be paid together and if applicable will be offset against one another when payments are processed.</p>
