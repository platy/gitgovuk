<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Reminder: complete the educational setting status form for school-led tutoring this week</h2>

<p>To help us support schools with tutoring, it is important that we understand how you are using your 2021 to 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-grant">school-led tutoring</a> grant.</p>

<p>Please complete the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://onlinecollections.des.fasst.org.uk/fastform/educational-setting-status" rel="external">educational setting status form</a> published on 14 July which includes three questions on school-led tutoring.</p>

<p>We have also published guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form">how to complete the form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Reminder: complete the year-end statement for school-led tutoring</h2>

<p>All schools, local authorities and virtual school heads that received the school led tutoring (SLT) grant must complete the relevant year-end statement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/mQGSRslJ90/start" rel="external">form for schools, academies and independent special schools</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://digital-forms.education.gov.uk/1iXoqU0XTs/start-page" rel="external">form for local authorities including virtual school heads</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We have published full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-led-tutoring-year-end-statement">how to complete the forms</a> and tutorial videos.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OYRpNpyna4" rel="external">Tutorial videos</a></p>

<p>To enable schools to include tuition during the summer holidays, you are required to complete the year-end statement by 16 September 2022.</p>

<p>You should only complete the form once you have delivered all SLT for the 2021 to 2022 academic year. The final date to deliver SLT is 31 August 2022.</p>

<p>If your school is not providing SLT in the summer holidays, we strongly recommend that you complete the year-end statement by the end of July.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Information: academy general annual grant allocation guides for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<p>Weâve now published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-general-annual-grant-allocation-guides-2022-to-2023/mainstream-academies-and-free-schools-opening-after-1-september-2022">2022 to 2023 general annual grant allocation guide for mainstream academies and free schools open from 1 September 2022.</a></p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Information: pupil premium reporting</h2>

<p>In October 2021 we set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools">PE and sport premium guidance</a> an intention to monitor compliance with the requirement to publish PE and sport premium reports online. Over the past academic year, DfE officials have been checking compliance of a randomised representative sample of schools. We have recently written to those schools from this sample where we have identified no online report has been published.</p>

<p>We would like to take this opportunity to remind all schools in receipt of the PE and sport premium that reports must be published by 31 July 2022 for the 2021 to 22 academic year. Further details of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pe-and-sport-premium-for-primary-schools">what must be included in your report</a> can be found on GOV.UK. If you choose to, you can use the recommended reporting template produced by <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.afpe.org.uk/physical-education/evidencing-the-impact-guidance-template/" rel="external">Association for PE</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youthsporttrust.org/resources/primary-pe-sport-premium" rel="external">Youth Sport Trust</a>. DfE officials will commence checks of PE and sport premium reports for the 2021 to 2022 academic year shortly after 31 July.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information: announcement of the next round of schools selected for the School Rebuilding Programme (SRP)</h2>

<p>On Tuesday 12 July, we announced the next group of schools which will have buildings replaced or refurbished as part of the School Rebuilding Programme. The programme addresses buildings in the worst condition across England. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-rebuilding-programme/school-rebuilding-programme">A list of the schools and further information</a> is available on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The School Rebuilding Programme is a 10-year programme that was announced by the Prime Minister in 2020. It is carrying out major rebuilding and refurbishment projects at 500 schools and sixth-form colleges across England, prioritised according to condition need. Investing in our school buildings is vital to support schools and teachers in delivering high-quality education, so that pupils gain the knowledge, skills and qualifications they need to succeed.</p>

<p>In 2022 to 2023, we expect to prioritise up to 300 schools in total. We are announcing a smaller group of schools now to maintain the pace of delivery and address some of the poorest condition buildings as soon as possible. We are still assessing all other nominations received and have not ruled out any nominated school at this point. We plan to make another announcement later this year to confirm further schools selected.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Information: IFRS 16 leases - delay to new lease approvals approach</h2>

<p>In March, we provided information about changes to the departmentâs approach to leasing following the implementation of IFRS 16 leases (subject to the outcome of the CIPFA consultation).</p>

<p>Once IFRS 16 is adopted, the distinction between operating and finance leases will end which could radically increase the number of leases requiring Secretary of State consent as they will become the equivalent of a finance lease and generate borrowing. We want to continue to allow local authority-maintained schools and academies to use leases to support their operation, maintaining the status quo without additional administrative burdens. Therefore, the new approach involves creating a General Consent Order, for particular classes of leased asset (formerly accounted for as operating leases).</p>

<p>Whilst academies will not be adopting IFRS 16, to ensure parity across the sector, the new lease approvals approach will also apply to academies.</p>

<p>Following the CIPFA consultation, implementation of IFRS 16 leases is now delayed for local authorities until 1 April 2024 although they can adopt earlier should they wish to. We are therefore postponing implementation of the new lease approvals approach for both local authority-maintained schools and academies. We expect to implement the new approach from 1st September 2024 for academies however will keep this under review.</p>

<p>Please continue to adhere to the terms set out in the Funding Agreement and Academy Trust Handbook where finance leases remain subject to the restriction on borrowing.</p>

<span class="number">7. </span>Information: using Twitter to contact ESFA</h2>

<p>The ESFA Enquiry Service is currently running a pilot to explore the use of Twitter as a channel in which to engage customers. The pilot has recently been extended for a further 12 months to better understand the potential and suitability of twitter as a contact channel.</p>

<p>We are asking for support from our customers with testing this out, and can now offer the option of contacting us with general funding/operational enquiries privately via the direct messaging (DM) function on twitter for enquiries throughout the pilot, as well as to provide us with feedback and tips to help us improve the service. This would be the kind of enquiries that customers would usually submit via the online form.</p>

<p>We hope that for simple enquiries you will receive a faster response on Twitter as opposed to the traditional enquiry form route into our advisors. The Twitter channel on which we would like you to contact us through the direct DM function is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/esfagov/" rel="external">@esfagov</a>. If you have questions about the pilot, please get in touch on Twitter via DM.</p>

<p>You will still also be able to contact us via the ESFA online enquiry form if you would prefer.</p>
