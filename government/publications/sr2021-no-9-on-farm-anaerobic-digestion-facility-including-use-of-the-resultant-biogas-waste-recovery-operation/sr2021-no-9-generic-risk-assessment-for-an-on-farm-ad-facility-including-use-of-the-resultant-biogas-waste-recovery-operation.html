<p>The facility must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a treatment capacity less than 100 tonnes each day</li>
  <li>only accept waste where the site has the capacity to store and treat that waste</li>
  <li>accept less than 35,000 tonnes a year</li>
</ul>

<p>The Environment Agency produces the generic risk assessments for all standard rules permits. These list the potential risks and how to manage them.</p>

<p>Check this generic risk assessment to understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the potential risks of operating an anaerobic digestion facility which includes using and storing the resultant biogas</li>
  <li>if your proposed activity has the same risks and you can apply for the standard rules permit</li>
  <li>how to manage the risks effectively</li>
</ul>

<p>Each risk comprises:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>information about the source, pathway and receptor – and the potential harm to that receptor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a judgement of the level of risk and justification of that judgement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>actions for managing the risk (through permitting) and a residual risk rating after managing it</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Risk management involves breaking or limiting the source-pathway-receptor linkage to reduce the risk. If we set minimum distances we explain the basis of the distance, for example by modelling.</p>

<p>We will control the residual risk (after risk management) when we assess compliance.</p>

<p>If you need to check the meaning of any terms we have used (in the context of this risk assessment), see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#terms">explanation of terms</a>.</p>

<p>This generic risk assessment is based on the following parameters.</p>

<p>Parameter 1</p>

<p>Permitted activities are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the storage and recovery of waste (R13, R1, R3)</li>
  <li>incineration on land (D10)</li>
</ul>

<p>Parameter 2</p>

<p>The permitted wastes are manures, slurries and biodegradable wastes produced from on-farm and dairy wastes. They must be suitable for digestion.</p>

<p>Parameter 3</p>

<p>The maximum quantity of waste received on site each day, including solids and liquids, must not exceed the designed storage and treatment capacity and cannot exceed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>100 tonnes in treatment at any one time</li>
  <li>35,000 tonnes a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parameter 4</p>

<p>Except for the auxiliary flare, the aggregate rated thermal input of all appliances used to burn biogas must be less than 5 megawatts.</p>

<p>Parameter 5</p>

<p>These rules do not allow any point source emission to land, surface waters or groundwater.</p>

<p>Parameters 6 to 14</p>

<p>The activities shall not be carried out within:</p>

<ul>
  <li>200 metres of the nearest receptor as measured from any combustion stack or stacks, unless the stacks are at least 7 metres high and the effective stack height of each stack is greater than 3 metres</li>
  <li>250 metres of the nearest sensitive receptor where any further treatment takes place by composting digestate fibre in the open</li>
  <li>500 metres of a European site (within the meaning of Regulation 8 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017) or a Site of Special Scientific Interest, including candidate or proposed sites</li>
  <li>a groundwater source protection zone 1 or 2, or if a source protection zone has not been defined then within 50 metres of any well, spring or borehole used for the supply of water for human consumption (including private water supplies)</li>
  <li>250 metres of the presence of great crested newts, where it is linked to the breeding ponds of the newts by good habitat</li>
  <li>10 metres of any watercourse</li>
  <li>50 metres of a Local Nature Reserve, Local Wildlife Site, Ancient Woodland or Scheduled Monument</li>
  <li>50 metres of a site that has species or habitats of principle importance (as listed in Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006) that the Environment Agency considers at risk to this activity, these are also often referred to as priority habitats and species</li>
  <li>a specified Air Quality Management Area</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Risk to local human population</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Releases of emissions <abbr title="nitrogen oxides">NOx</abbr>, <abbr title="sulphur oxides">SOx</abbr>, <abbr title="carbon monoxide">CO</abbr> and other gases</h3>

<p><abbr title="nitrogen oxides">NOx</abbr>, <abbr title="sulphur oxides">SOx</abbr>, <abbr title="carbon monoxide">CO</abbr> and other gases travel through the air and can be inhaled.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm to human health as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory irritation</li>
  <li>illness</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because there is potential for exposure to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone living close to the site</li>
  <li>members of the public at locations to which they could be regularly exposed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>The following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set back distances apply for effective stack height and open processing of waste</li>
  <li>new sites – lagoons must be covered with a fixed cover and an appropriately designed air abatement and gas capture system</li>
  <li>existing sites – lagoons must either be allowed to develop a crust or have floating covers</li>
  <li>monitoring of emission levels from biogas driven combined heat and power plants and specified generators as required by the permit and in accordance with guidance ‘Monitoring stack emissions: environmental permits’ (formerly M2) and ‘Monitoring Stack emissions: low risk MCPs and specified generators’ (formerly M5)</li>
  <li>activities shall be managed and operated in accordance with a management system (including the inspection and maintenance of equipment and engines) and the point source emissions to air with emission limits requirement</li>
  <li>other monitoring shall be reported as permit requirements</li>
  <li>the activities shall not be carried out within a specified Air Quality Management Area for <abbr title="nitrogen oxides">NOx</abbr>
</li>
  <li>leak detection and repair programmes will be in place to mitigate and prevent methane emissions</li>
  <li>gas pressure will be monitored to minimise the release of biogas and all pressure relief systems will be inspected and calibrated as required by the permit</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Release of micro-organisms (bioaerosols)</h3>

<p>Bioaerosols travel through the air and can be inhaled.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm to human health as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory irritation</li>
  <li>illness</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as low</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as low</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as low</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because there is potential for release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when waste is received</li>
  <li>because digestate fibre can be treated by open composting</li>
  <li>during storage of digestate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>The following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the permit does not allow anaerobic digestion activities to be carried out within 200 metres of the nearest sensitive receptor</li>
  <li>open composting of digestate fibre is not permitted within 250m – set back distances are sufficiently precautionary so that bioaerosols are at background level</li>
  <li>open composting can only be done where the windrows are covered or where there is static aeration with appropriate filters or a scrubbing system</li>
  <li>air abatement needs to be deployed to mitigate channelled emissions</li>
  <li>bio-filters are monitored for efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Odour</h3>

<p>Odour travels through the air and can be inhaled.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential risk to the local population as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nuisance</li>
  <li>loss of amenity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because local residents are sensitive to odour. Odour can result from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a wide range of waste, particularly when the site receives it</li>
  <li>the release of biogas</li>
  <li>digestate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>The following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an odour management plan is required</li>
  <li>fugitive emissions from slurry and digestate storage must be prevented or minimised and other fugitive emissions are not permitted</li>
  <li>all waste is stored for the minimal time and treated as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>new lagoons must have a fixed cover with a designed and maintained abatement system</li>
  <li>lagoons on existing sites must either allow a natural crust to form or install a cover as soon as is reasonably practicable or at the latest by 2027</li>
  <li>all channelled emissions will be treated before release</li>
  <li>operators will take additional measures to ensure ammonia release is controlled</li>
  <li>fugitive source emissions of biogas shall be minimised by implementing a leak detection and repair programme</li>
  <li>all appropriate measures shall be implemented</li>
  <li>stored digestate will be stable</li>
  <li>all abatement systems are designed, monitored and maintained to treat specified emissions and off-gases</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Noise and vibration</h3>

<p>Noise travels through the air and vibration through the ground.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential risk to the local population as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>nuisance</li>
  <li>loss of amenity</li>
  <li>loss of sleep</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because local residents can be sensitive to noise and vibration. However, there is low potential for exposure.</p>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>The following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>noise and vibration shall be minimised and not cause nuisance</li>
  <li>fans and condensate traps will be checked for water</li>
  <li>fans and extraction systems will be checked and maintained</li>
  <li>flares must be kept to a minimum to reduce noise impact and a record of use kept and reported</li>
  <li>a noise and vibration management plan may be required</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Risk to local human population, livestock and wildlife</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Gaining unauthorised access to site</h3>

<p>There is a risk of direct physical contact with all on-site hazards such as wastes, machinery and vehicles.</p>

<p>There is a risk of causing injury to humans or livestock.</p>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as low</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as low</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as low</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because it is carried out within enclosed digesters so physical contact is minimised.</p>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>The following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>activities shall be managed and operated in accordance with a management system which includes site security measures to prevent unauthorised access</li>
  <li>all sites will have a <abbr title="The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002">DSEAR</abbr> assessment which covers unauthorised access to site</li>
  <li>maintenance workers or contractors are not permitted on site without a suitable qualification and they must have permission to do the work</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking this action will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Risk to local human population and local environment</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Arson and vandalism</h3>

<p>Arson and vandalism risk causing the release of polluting materials to the air (smoke or fumes), water or land.</p>

<p>Arson and vandalism can cause:</p>

<ul>
  <li>smoke to travel through the air</li>
  <li>spillages and contaminated firewater to run-off from the site and through surface water drains and ditches</li>
</ul>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory irritation, illness and nuisance to local population</li>
  <li>injury to staff, fire fighters, arsonists or vandals</li>
  <li>pollution of water or land</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as medium</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>biogas is flammable</li>
  <li>the risk of direct physical contact is reduced by the activity being carried out within enclosed systems</li>
  <li>the consequences of an incident may be serious, including risk to the safety and wellbeing of people and loss of containment causing releases to the environment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Managing the risk</h4>

<p>As risk 2.1 plus the following manages the risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an accident management plan is required as part of the management system (covers fire and spillages)</li>
  <li>all areas of risk are identified in the <abbr title="The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002">DSEAR</abbr> assessment</li>
  <li>a Hazard &amp; Operability Study (<abbr title="Hazard and Operability Study">HAZOP</abbr>) or similar risk identification technique is done to produce a schedule of planned maintenance (as identified by the <abbr title="Hazard and Operability Study">HAZOP</abbr> or risk assessment or suppliers), and is documented  </li>
  <li>warning signs are clearly displayed and personnel know gas alarm procedures</li>
  <li>visitors shall be accompanied</li>
  <li>repair and maintenance can only happen if the plant manager gives permission and signs to the effect</li>
  <li>fire control processes and procedures as set out in the <abbr title="The Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations 2002">DSEAR</abbr> plan and they shall be communicated to the local fire service</li>
  <li>leak detection schemes are in place to prevent and minimise fugitive biogas release</li>
  <li>the site shall be secure</li>
  <li>any breaches shall be reported</li>
  <li>contingency measures must be in place in the event of loss of plant</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking these actions will control the risk and rate it as ‘low’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Accidental explosion of gas</h3>

<p>An explosion of biogas risks causing fire and smoke to travel through the air.</p>

<p>We have assessed the potential harm as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>respiratory irritation, illness and nuisance to the local population</li>
  <li>injury to staff or fire fighters</li>
  <li>air, water or land pollution</li>
</ul>

<h4>Judgement of risk</h4>

<p>We have judged the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>likelihood of the hazard affecting the receptor as low</li>
  <li>overall severity of potential consequences as medium</li>
  <li>overall risk rating as medium</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for giving the activity this rating is because the risk is reduced by an effective management system being in place, as required by the permit.</p>

<p>However, biogas is flammable, and the consequences are likely to be serious, including risk to:</p>

<ul>

<h2>Explanation of terms</h2>

<h3>Receptor</h3>

<p>The things at risk and that need protecting.</p>

<p>Receptors considered include: atmosphere, land, surface waters, groundwater, humans, wildlife and their habitats.</p>

<p>A single receptor may be at risk from several different sources and all must be addressed.</p>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The agent or process that has the potential to cause harm.</p>

<p>A contaminant or pollutant (a hazard) that has the potential to cause harm. For example, the activity or operation taking place for which a particular hazard may arise.</p>

<h3>Harm</h3>

<p>The harmful consequence to the receptor if the hazard is realised.</p>

<h3>Pathways</h3>

<p>The route or means by which a defined hazard may affect a receptor.</p>

<h3>Source-pathway-receptor linkage</h3>

<p>There has to be a link between the source, pathway and receptor for there to be a risk.</p>

<h3>Likelihood of exposure</h3>

<p>This is the likelihood of the receptors being exposed to the hazard. The meaning of the definitions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high – exposure is probable – direct exposure is likely with no or few barriers between the hazard source and the receptor</li>
  <li>medium – exposure is fairly probable - feasible exposure is possible as the barriers to exposure are less controllable</li>
  <li>low – exposure is unlikely – several barriers exist between the hazard source and receptor to reduce exposure</li>
  <li>very low – exposure is very unlikely – effective, multiple barriers are in place to reduce exposure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall magnitude of potential consequence</h3>

<p>This is the severity of the consequence if the hazard is realised and may cause actual or potential harm.</p>

<p>This will have a high, medium, low or very low rating using attributes and scaling to consider ‘harm’.</p>

<h3>Risk rating</h3>

<p>We work out the risk rating by combining the likelihood of exposure with the magnitude of the potential consequences.</p>

<p>We assign these ratings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>high risk – requires additional assessment and active management</li>
  <li>medium risk – requires additional assessment and may need active management and, or monitoring (or both)</li>
  <li>low and very low risks will require a periodic review</li>
</ul>
