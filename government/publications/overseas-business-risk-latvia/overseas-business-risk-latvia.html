<p>Information on key security and political risks which UK businesses may face when operating in Latvia.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Political and Economic</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Overview</h3>

<p>The Republic of Latvia is located in North Eastern Europe. Latvia borders Estonia to the north, Russia and Belarus to the east and Lithuania to the south, and has a maritime border with Sweden to the west. The strategic location of Latvia has been a major influence on the country’s diverse history and culture.</p>

<p>Latvia first gained its independence in November 1918. From 1940 to 1941 it was occupied by the Soviet Union under the provisions of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, then by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944, and again by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1991.</p>

<p>Latvia once again proclaimed its independence on 4 May 1990, but it was not until 21 August 1991, that Latvia approved its constitutional law and proclaimed itself a fully independent country once again.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Political and Economic</h3>

<p>Latvia is a unitary parliamentary republic. Following the administrative territorial reforms in June 2021, Latvia is now divided into 42 regions. The capital and largest city, both in Latvia and in the Baltic states, is Riga. With a population of 1.9 million Latvia is one of the least-populous members of the European Union. Latvia has been a member of the United Nations since 17 September 1991; of the European Union since 1 May 2004 and of NATO since 29 March 2004. On 28 July 2016, Latvia became a member of the OECD. The 100 seat unicameral Latvian parliament, the Saeima, is elected every 4 years. The last elections were on 6 October 2018, with the next scheduled to take place October 2022.</p>

<p>The President is elected by the Saeima every four years. The current President of Latvia is Egils Levits who took office on 8 July 2019. The President nominates a Prime Minister whose appointment, together with the cabinet, must be approved by a vote in the Saeima. Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins was appointed Prime Minister of Latvia in January 2019. The most senior civil servant in Latvia is the Director of the State Chancellery, and the most senior civil servants in each of the Government ministries are known as State Secretaries.</p>

<p>After years of economic stagnation in the early 1990s, Latvia enjoyed a period of record-breaking growth following its accession to the EU in 2004.  Latvia’s GDP growth peaked at 12.2% in 2006, and the average annual wage increased by 19.9% in 2007. But domestic demand grew excessively, especially private consumption and real estate investment, fuelled by cheap credit. The economy developed dangerous imbalances that were exacerbated by the global financial crisis. GDP growth became negative in 2008 and a contraction of 18% in 2009 was recorded as the highest in Europe. In December 2008, the Latvian Government secured a €7.5 billion loan from the IMF/EU and began measures to stabilise the economy, including structural reforms. In the first quarter of 2010, after exports and industrial production picked up, Latvia’s GDP recorded its first quarter-on-quarter growth in nearly two years. In 2014 Latvia joined the Eurozone. In 2019, GDP growth reached 2.2% (y-o-y). In 2020 due to the global Covid-19 pandemic Latvia experienced a GDP decline of 3.6% (y-o-y). GDP is projected to grow by 4.3% in 2021, 3.6% in 2022 and 4.8% in 2023, according to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/latvia-economic-snapshot/#:~:text=Strong%20economic%20growth%20is%20projected,2022%20and%204.8%25%20in%202023." rel="external">OECD</a>.</p>

<p>Historically, Latvia has been one of the main transit points for east-west trade flows. Its geographical location remains central to strategic transportation flows connecting major world economies like the EU, the CIS, China and the Far East. The main sectors of the Latvian economy have been timber processing and trade services. Other major sectors in Latvia are: chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, electronics and electrical engineering, agriculture and food processing, telecommunication and travel services, and the textile and clothing sector.</p>

<p>According to the Latvian Central Statistical Bureau, the UK was Latvia’s seventh largest foreign trade partner. In terms of the UK’s trading partners, Latvia was ranked at 61 from Q4 FY 2020 up to the end of Q3 FY 2021, accounting for 0.1% of total UK trade. In the same period, the total value of trade in goods and services (exports and imports) between the UK and Latvia was £1.8 billion.</p>

<p>In 2021, the main exports to the UK are wood products and the main imports from the UK were alcoholic beverages, cars, refined oil, aircraft and specialised machinery. The main services exported from the UK to Latvia were telecommunications, transportation, travel, and other business services. Key services imported to the UK from Latvia were manufacturing, travel, transportation and other business services.</p>

<p>In the World Bank <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings" rel="external">Ease of doing Business</a> list Latvia is ranked 19th (out of 190 countries).</p>

<p>The UK government can provide finance or credit insurance specifically to support UK exports through UK Export Finance – the UK’s export credit agency.

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Business and Human rights</h2>

<p>As a member state of the EU, OSCE and the UN, Latvia is actively engaged on human rights issues within those organisations. Freedom House ranked Latvia as a “Free” consolidated democracy with a score of 89 out of 100 in its 2021 report. Latvia has been a Member State of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) since 1991 and has ratified 47 ILO International Labour Standards (Conventions), including the eight fundamental Conventions.</p>

<p>Latvian law entitles all workers, except members of the armed forces, to form and join independent unions and recognises the right to strike, subject to limitations related to public safety. The law provides for collective bargaining and prohibits anti-union discrimination or employers’ interference in union functions. However, union membership rates are relatively low.</p>

<p>Latvian law prohibits forced or compulsory labour, including by children, and the government generally enforces such laws effectively. Women enjoy the same rights as men.  However in practice women may face hiring and pay discrimination, particularly in the private sector despite a law prohibiting employment discrimination. According to the 2021 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index, Latvia ranks 20 out of 156 countries. Whilst the majority of employers believe in equal opportunities for all employees regardless of their religious beliefs, citizenship, place of residence, gender or knowledge of the official state language, there are some cases of bias.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Bribery and Corruption</h2>

<p>Under the UK Bribery Act 2010, it is a UK criminal offence to offer, promise, give, agree, receive or accept bribes. The UK can prosecute British Nationals, UK residents, UK Corporate Bodies and Scottish Partnerships irrespective of whether the offending took place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition, a commercial organisation carrying on a business in the UK can be prosecuted for failing to prevent bribery. This can be the conduct of any person linked to the organisation, whether a UK national, and would include for example employees, intermediaries and consultants. It does not matter whether the acts or omissions which form part of the offence take place in the UK or elsewhere.</p>

<p>According to Transparency International’s <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview" rel="external">Corruption Perception Index</a> (CPI), Latvia was ranked in 36th place in 2021. Latvia is represented in Transparency International by the local NGO Delna. Transparency International Latvia/Delna promotes an open, just and democratic society, free from corruption in politics, in business and interpersonal relations.</p>

<p>The main anti-corruption authority in Latvia is the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB). KNAB regularly collects information about progress achieved in implementation and reports to the Cabinet of Ministers. For more information on KNAB responsibilities and activities, see <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.knab.gov.lv/en/" rel="external">here</a>. To report any corruption, please use the free hotline number: +371 8000 2070.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Terrorism Threat</h2>

<p>There is a low threat from terrorism. But you should be aware of the global risk of indiscriminate terrorist attacks which could be in public areas, including those frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers.

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Protective Security Advice</h2>

<p>There have been reports of petty theft and robbery. Beware of pickpockets, avoid unlit streets and parks at night, and be extra vigilant if walking alone. Most thefts have been reported in Riga Old town, Central Market, central train and bus stations. You should remain particularly vigilant in these areas.

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>IP rights are territorial, that is they only give protection in the countries where they are granted or registered. If you are thinking about trading internationally, then you should consider registering your IP rights in your export markets.</p>

<p>Several government institutions are responsible for the protection of intellectual property rights in Latvia. The Economic Police, reporting to the Ministry of the Interior, deal with infringements of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Justice is in charge of the Patent Office which is responsible for the protection of industrial property rights: the protection of trademarks, brands, industrial designs, semiconductor topography and indications of geographical origin. The Patent Office shall admit and examine applications for the legal protections of inventions, industrial designs and trademarks, grant patents and certificates of trademark registration. The Patent Office shall adopt regulations, advise legal entities and natural persons, compile and publish its official publication and cooperate with foreign and international organizations involved in the legal protection of industrial property.</p>

<p>Copyrights and related rights fall within the competence of the Ministry of Culture and non-governmental organisation Copyright and Communication Consulting Agency/ Latvian Authors Association (AKKA/LAA) Copyright and Communication Consultations Agency/ Latvian Copyright Agency.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the protection of plant varieties and the geographical indications of foodstuffs and agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Cases of unfair competition are reviewed by the Ministry of Economics and the Competition Council.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transport is responsible for issues related to domains, servers and downloads.</p>

<p>The State Revenue Service deals with cases of infringement, seizure of fake goods and industrial intelligence.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor’s Office and courts take charge of the investigation and trial of infringement cases.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Organised Crime</h2>

<p>Criminal groups active in the Baltic countries work as a bridge between criminals operating, in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine and the EU criminal environment. They look towards both the west and the rest of the EU, and towards the east and beyond the borders of the EU.</p>

<p>Cross-border law enforcement cooperation can be lengthy and cumbersome due to the different types of legislation on either side of Latvia’s border. As a result, cross-border operations can occur by certain organised crime groups and markets. A large volume of transport across the borders and other vulnerabilities of the logistics sector can lead to further trade fraud in this region.</p>

<p>The main institutions in Latvia which fight against various forms of organised crime include the Tax and Customs Police Department, the State Border Guard, the State Police and the Latvian State Security Service.</p>
