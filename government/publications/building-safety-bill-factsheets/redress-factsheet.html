<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The government is clear that those responsible for shoddy workmanship that has caused homes to be unsafe bear the responsibility to put those problems right.</p>

<p>While some parts of industry have done the right thing and funded the remediation of serious defects, too many seek to avoid their responsibilities.</p>

<p>That is why we are taking action to extend legal rights to redress for shoddy workmanship and unacceptable defects. The changes we are making will enhance the ability of building owners, homeowners, and leaseholders to seek compensation for defective work carried out on their properties.</p>

<p>The first part of this factsheet is about the changes we are making to the Defective Premises Act 1972. 
The second part of this factsheet is about section 38 of the Building Act 1984.</p>

<h2>Defective Premises Act 1972</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972 requires those involved in constructing a dwelling to ensure that the dwelling is ‘fit for habitation’ when the work is completed. The courts have held that dwellings need to remain fit for habitation for a reasonable period thereafter.</p>

<p>If the work is completed to an unacceptable standard, a claim for compensation can be brought by the person who originally commissioned the dwelling, or any person subsequently acquiring a ‘legal or equitable interest’ in the dwelling, such as the freeholder of a block, a homeowner, or a leaseholder.</p>

<p>Currently, a claim for compensation can only be brought for unacceptable work related to the ‘provision’ of a dwelling, for example building a new house or converting offices or a large house to flats. Refurbishment works (such as repairing a roof, installing new insulation, or fitting external cladding) are not normally within scope.</p>

<p>A claim for compensation for unacceptable work must currently be brought within six years of the completion of the work.</p>

<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We are substantially increasing the period of time in which building owners, homeowners and leaseholders can make a claim for compensation following the completion of defective work.</p>

<p>Through the Building Safety Bill, we are extending the limitation period for claims brought under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act 1972.</p>

<p>The limitation period will be extended retrospectively (i.e. for work already completed) from 6 to 30 years. This means that claims will be able to be brought for work that was completed up to 30 years prior to the relevant provision of the Bill coming into force (i.e. back to mid-1992 if the Bill completes its passage as expected in the middle of this year).</p>

<p>The limitation period will be extended prospectively (i.e. for work completed in the future) from 6 to 15 years.</p>

<p>Going forward, we are also significantly expanding the type of work that is subject to the duty under the Defective Premises Act 1972. We are expanding the Defective Premises Act to include refurbishment and other work to an existing dwelling. This means that contractors who undertake any work on any dwelling (or any building containing a dwelling, such as a block of flats, even if the work is done to a non-residential part of the building) will be required to ensure it is fit for habitation when that work is completed with respect to that work. If they do not do this, a claim for compensation can be brought.</p>

<p>This change will allow homeowners to seek compensation through the civil courts for unacceptable work undertaken on their properties. As this is a new provision, this change will only apply prospectively (i.e. only to work completed following commencement of the Bill).</p>

<h2>Who can claim compensation?</h2>

<p>Compensation can be claimed by the person who originally commissioned the work, or by any person with a ‘legal or equitable interest’ in the dwelling. This would include the freeholder of a block of flats, a person who subsequently buys a house, as well as leaseholders of flats.</p>

<h2>Who can compensation be claimed from?</h2>

<p>Compensation can be claimed from anyone responsible for the defective work, such as builders and other contractors, architects or designers.</p>

<h2>Who is expected to take this legal action?</h2>

<p>Building owners are responsible for ensuring their buildings are safe, and they should meet the costs of remediation without passing them on to leaseholders wherever possible - through their own resources or by recovering costs from applicable warranty schemes, or from the developers or contractors who were responsible for the defects. Making a claim under the Defective Premises Act will be one measure that we expect building owners to explore.</p>

<h2>What if a building owner does not explore whether the provisions of the Defective Premises Act are applicable?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Bill creates a legal requirement for building owners to prove they have tried all routes to cover the cost of essential safety works, along with evidence that this has been done. If this does not happen, leaseholders will be able to challenge these costs in the courts.</p>

<h2>Does this just apply to flats in high-rise buildings?</h2>

<p>The Defective Premises Act applies to all dwellings in England and Wales, not just to flats in high-rise buildings.</p>

<h2>Who will decide if a house or flat is fit for habitation or not?</h2>

<p>It is for a court to decide on the facts of the specific case whether a dwelling was fit for habitation at the time the work was completed.</p>

<p>In order for a dwelling to be fit for habitation, it must be capable of occupation for a reasonable time without risk to the health or safety of the occupants, and without undue inconvenience or discomfort to the occupants.</p>

<p>A dwelling can be unfit for habitation even if the defect which has made it so is not evident at the time of completion.</p>

<h2>What about wear and tear?</h2>

<p>Under the Defective Premises Act, fitness for habitation is judged at the time of the completion of the work.</p>

<p>However, a dwelling can still be unfit for habitation even if the defects which has made it so is not evident at the time of completion, e.g. where inadequate materials were used.</p>

<h2>What if the developer claims that they were just following established practice at the time?</h2>

<p>Liability under the Defective Premises Act is ‘strict’. This means that no fault or negligence has to be shown in a claim.</p>

<p>If a building is not fit for habitation due to defective work, then a claim can be brought - there is no space within the Act to consider whether the defendant was at fault, and there is no burden on the claimant to prove that.</p>

<p>It is also not a valid defence in a Defective Premises Act case for the defendant to claim to have followed established practice at the time. What needs to be shown to the court is that the dwelling was not fit for habitation as a result of the work that was done.</p>

<h2>How long do I have to bring a claim?</h2>

<p>The limitation period under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act will be extended retrospectively to 30 years, meaning that claims in relation to work completed prior to commencement of the provision must be brought within 30 years of the completion of the defective work<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The limitation period will be extended prospectively to 15 years, meaning that claims in relation to work completed after commencement must be brought within 15 years of the completion of the defective work.</p>

<h2>Do the changes apply to work already completed?</h2>

<p>The extension of the limitation period under section 1 of the Defective Premises Act as it currently applies will be retrospective. This means that where the defective work was completed in relation to the ‘provision’ of a dwelling, the extended limitation period applies to work already completed.</p>

<p>The inclusion of refurbishment works in the Defective Premises Act will only apply to work completed following the Building Safety Bill becoming law.</p>

<h2>What if the 30 years runs out while legal proceedings are still ongoing?</h2>

<p>As long a claim is started within the 30-year time frame, legal action will be able to continue.</p>

<h2>Do the refurbishment changes apply to work I do on my own home?</h2>

<p>The changes to the Defective Premises Act to include refurbishments only apply to work done on a dwelling as part of a business. This means that an individual doing work on their own or friends’ homes (e.g. DIY) is not within scope of the changes.</p>

<h2>When will the changes come into effect?</h2>

<p>The changes will come into effect two months after Royal Assent, which is when the Bill has passed through all the Parliamentary stages.</p>

<p>Section 38 of the Building Act 1984 has not been brought into force, meaning that, although it was approved by Parliament as part of the 1984 Act, it has never taken effect.</p>

<p>It allows a claim for compensation to be brought for physical damage (e.g. injury or damage to property) caused by a breach of building regulations. For example, if a fire is caused in a property, or if a child living in a flat develops a respiratory condition because a property is damp, due to building work not meeting building regulations at the time the work was done, section 38 will allow the homeowner to seek compensation from those responsible for the damage caused.</p>

<p>Purely financial loss is not covered by section 38, although it is in scope of a Defective Premises Act claim.</p>

<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We will be commencing section 38 of the Building Act 1984 alongside the Defective Premises Act changes, meaning we will be bringing this part of the legislation into force.</p>

<p>We are also legislating to extend the limitation period for section 38 of the Building Act to 15 years. This means that homeowners will be able to bring a claim up to 15 years after the work was completed.</p>

<p>As this provision has not yet been commenced, the provision, including the extended limitation period, will apply prospectively, meaning that it will apply to work done after the section comes into force.</p>

<h2>Who can claim compensation?</h2>

<p>The person who has suffered damage (either injury or damage to property) as a result of the breach of building regulations can claim compensation.</p>

<h2>Who can compensation be claimed from?</h2>

<p>Compensation can be claimed from the person whose breach of building regulations caused the damage. This will vary depending on the facts of the case, but could include, for example, a builder whose work breached building regulations.</p>

<h2>Which buildings does this apply to?</h2>

<p>Section 38 of the Building Act applies to all buildings in England and Wales, not just dwellings.</p>

<h2>How long do I have to bring a claim?</h2>

<p>A claim must be brought within 15 years of the completion of the work, providing the work was done after the section is commenced.</p>

<h2>Do the changes apply to work already completed?</h2>

<p>No – section 38 of the Building Act 1984 will only apply to work done after it is brought into force.</p>
