<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Bill establishes new legal duties for landlords and building owners of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/buildings-included-in-the-new-more-stringent-regulatory-regime-factsheet">high rise residential buildings of 18 metres or at least 7 storeys</a> to keep their building safe. There will be a cost associated with some of these duties, which can be passed to leaseholders through a new Building Safety Charge.</p>

<h2>Who will pay for the Building Safety Charge?</h2>

<p>Leaseholders with leases over 7 years or more, regardless of whether they are an owner occupier or renting to a tenant, in a high-rise multi-occupied building covered by the Bill will be liable to pay the Building Safety Charge.</p>

<p>This charge will apply to a leaseholder regardless of whether their landlord is a private landlord, local authority or housing association.</p>

<h2>What does the Building Safety Charge cover?</h2>

<p>A list of the costs that can be passed through the Building Safety Charge are narrowly defined in the Bill as ‘relevant building safety measures’. These measures include, for example, appointing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/building-safety-manager-factsheet">Building Safety Manager</a> or preparing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/residents-voice-factsheet">residents’ engagement</a> strategy.</p>

<h2>What does this mean for landlords and building owners?</h2>

<p>There are a number of requirements around how the Building Safety Charge  is raised, collected and accounted for. Those responsible for buildings will need to familiarise themselves with the new arrangements.</p>

<p>Landlords and building owners need to be aware of a new statutory definition that identifies Accountable Persons for occupied higher-risk buildings. Accountable Persons are landlords and freeholders who are in charge of repairing the  of the building.</p>

<p>Landlords will be able to charge leaseholders for the costs of a narrowly defined set of safety measures. Other costs related to remediation, including capital costs   cannot be passed to leaseholders using the Building Safety Charge.  The charge cannot be levied to short-term renters or to social tenants. As with existing duties to maintain buildings for social tenants, local authorities and housing associations will need to fund the cost of fulfilling their obligations under the Building Safety Bill via existing revenue streams.</p>

<h2>What are landlords and building owners required to do for the Building Safety Charge?</h2>

<p>Where the activities defined by the Bill as a “relevant building safety measure” the Bill proposes that they will be collected as a Building Safety Charge. There are also some costs that cannot be passed to leaseholders; these include the cost of penalties from enforcement action against an Accountable Person and costs incurred because of negligence.</p>

<p>There will be certain obligations on landlords and building owners, where we will set out the details in secondary legislation. This includes calculating and apportioning the Building Safety Charge, providing a budget of estimated costs, and giving leaseholders a written demand. Leaseholders will have the right to challenge the reasonableness of the Building Safety Charge, in the same way service charges can be challenged.</p>

<p>Further information about the frequency of billing will be provided for in secondary legislation, but the government intends that building owners have the flexibility to bill leaseholders to tie into their existing service charge arrangements. The government intends that leaseholders must be given the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what building safety measures have been carried out and the costs</li>
  <li>the charges payable by and received from the individual leaseholder billed</li>
  <li>any financial contributions towards the costs received or made by building owners</li>
  <li>any remaining balance in the account, which must be used towards charges in the next annual accounting period</li>
</ul>

<p>Landlords and building owners should familiarise themselves with the Building Safety Charge provisions in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/building-safety-bill">Bill</a>. You can access a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3021/publications" rel="external">detailed explanation of the clauses in the Bill</a>. You should consider how best to communicate this charge to leaseholders and prepare them for the new arrangements.</p>

<h2>How much will the Building Safety Charge cost?</h2>

<p>The estimated average monthly cost to a leaseholder is estimated to be between £9 and £26 via the Building Safety Charge. You can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/impact-assessment-factsheet">more information on costs</a>.</p>

<p>We would expect many building owners to already be undertaking a robust assessment and management of risk, engaging residents effectively, and managing information about their building well. Therefore, some of the costs illustrated in the Building Safety Charge that the Bill now requires may already be incurred as part of standard practice.</p>

<p>In such cases, these costs will be recategorized as costs payable as a Building Safety Charge and be partially offset by a corresponding reduction in service charge costs.</p>

<h2>When will the Building Safety Charge come into force?</h2>

<p>The changes are intended to come into effect after the Building Safety Bill has been passed by Parliament and become law. Building owners can find out <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-transition-plan">more about when the changes will come in</a>.</p>

<p>In any event, the mechanism to collect the Building Safety Charge will come into force before the legal requirement to undertake any new duties. This means that building owners will be able to recover any costs incurred in undertaking their building safety duties as soon as the provisions of the Bill come into effect.</p>
