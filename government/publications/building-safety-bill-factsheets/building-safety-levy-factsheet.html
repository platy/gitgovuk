<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>As part of government’s commitment to ensure that the industry plays its part in contributing towards costs towards remediation, we are introducing a levy on developers when they apply for building control approval in respect of higher-risk residential buildings in England. It is only right that the residential developers, who construct new higher-risk residential buildings and so will gain from the restoration of confidence in the housing market, should help fund the significant costs associated with fixing them when they’re unsafe.</p>

<h2>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>Clause 57 of the Building Safety Bill gives the Secretary of State powers to impose a new Building Safety Levy   in England, that will contribute towards the government’s costs for remediating historical building safety defects. This will apply to developers making an application to the Building Safety Regulator for building control approval, the new “<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/building-control-regime-for-higher-risk-buildings-gateways-2-and-3-factsheet">Gateway  two</a>” process to be introduced in building regulations.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This is a new levy on developers. In addition to the new Residential Property Developer Tax (which will tax the profits of larger developers for at least 10 years), the levy will contribute towards fixing historical fire safety defects, including unsafe cladding.</p>

<p>We will establish three regulatory “Gateways” at key stages in design and construction, and introduce new requirements during construction, that will apply to higher-risk buildings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Planning Gateway one – at the planning application stage</li>
  <li>Gateway two – before building work starts</li>
  <li>Gateway three – when building work is completed</li>
</ul>

<p>These are stop/go decision points that must be passed before a development can proceed to the next stage, strengthening regulatory oversight of design and construction. At Gateway two, construction cannot begin until the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/building-safety-regulator-factsheet">Building  Safety Regulator</a> approves the building control application.</p>

<p>There will be sanctions for failure to pay the levy which will be defined in regulations. This will result in the Gateway two application not being approved by the Building Safety Regulator.</p>

<h2>Who will have to pay the building safety levy?</h2>

<p>The levy will apply to developments within scope of the Gateway 2 regulatory process, unless otherwise excluded. That means residential buildings or care homes over 18m or 7 storeys – but subject to exclusions, which we are consulting on.</p>

<p>The powers in the Building Safety Bill allow the Secretary of State to specify who is to pay the levy. <br>
Our consultation launched on 21 July proposes that the Client of a project within scope of the prospective Building Safety Regime is responsible for paying, or ensuring payment of, the levy.</p>

<h2>Will the levy apply to the devolved administrations?</h2>

<p>The levy will apply only when developers seek building control approval to develop certain higher-risk buildings in England. Housing and building safety are devolved matters, with each of the four nations responsible for developing and enforcing their own regulations.</p>

<h2>How much will the levy cost developers and how will it be calculated?</h2>

<p>On 21 July, the government launched a consultation seeking views on the design of the levy, including how it will be calculated.</p>

<p>The government will make a decision on the eventual levy rate, informed by the evidence received from our consultation, and balancing revenue raised with potential impacts on housing supply and developers. The levy rate will be set out in regulations and may be varied over time.</p>

<h2>How much will the levy raise?</h2>

<p>A decision on how much the levy will seek to raise from the sector will be informed by responses received to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-building-safety-levy">Building Safety Levy consultation</a>, launched on 21 July.</p>

<h2>Will the levy increase costs and mean fewer homes are built?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Levy consultation, launched on 21 July seeks evidence of potential housing supply impacts.
In designing the levy, we will seek to balance raising revenue to support remediation of historical building safety defects and minimising the impact on housing supply, whilst ensuring the impact on developers is appropriate – including avoiding unnecessary complexity or delays for developers.</p>

<h2>Who will collect the levy?</h2>

<p>A decision on the administrative body for the levy will be made in due course.</p>

<h1>Won’t developers just pass this on to leaseholders? Isn’t this just another tax on residents?</h1>

<p>The levy will be charged to developers on new higher-risk residential buildings before there are residents of these properties.</p>

<h2>Won’t this process just slow down development?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Regulator will need to determine building control applications at Gateway 2 within 12 weeks, and we expect the levy process to take place within that timescale, except where a review or appeal occurs.</p>

<h2>Exactly how are you going to protect SME builders? Won’t the levy just mean that only the largest builders can afford to build the larger buildings?</h2>

<p>The Secretary of State was clear in his announcement in February that our small and medium-sized builders would be protected.</p>

<p>The Levy Consultation, launched on 21 July seeks views on how the design of the levy might protect SMEs, for example through the ability to agree payment schedules if a SME could not pay the levy in full upfront.</p>

<h2>What will the money from the levy be used for?</h2>

<p>It will be used for the purpose of meeting the government’s building safety expenditure (such as providing assistance for the purpose of removing unsafe cladding).</p>
