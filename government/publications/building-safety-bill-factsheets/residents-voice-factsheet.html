<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>Every resident of a multi-occupancy building should expect that their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/accountable-persons-factsheet">Accountable Person</a> is managing their building to be safe and that they are informed about the measures being taken. The Bill places requirements on the Accountable Person to ensure this happens and empowers residents to raise safety concerns and be taken seriously by those responsible for managing the safety of their building.</p>

<p>The Accountable Person must ensure the effective assessment and management of their building’s safety. They must also inform and include residents in any decision- making about their building’s safety, as well as providing further information to residents.</p>

<p>The Bill also recognises that in multi-occupancy buildings residents have an important role to play in keeping their building safe for all its residents. Within the Bill, residents have three safety-related obligations to help them to play their part. Where residents fall short of their obligations the Accountable Person has the ability to pursue compliance through the county courts.</p>

<p>Residents also have the right to escalate complaints to the new Building Safety Regulator, where the Accountable Person has not resolved their safety concerns. This additional process will ensure that their concerns are addressed and not dismissed.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this factsheet, any reference to ‘residents’ is to be regarded as referring to all resident tenures, including owners and renters of residential units in a high-rise building, whether they live there or not.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Dame Judith Hackitt’s Independent Review found that residents did not have a strong enough voice in the management of their buildings. They often:</p>

<ul>
  <li>did not have the chance to offer views and participate in the decision-making process about the management of safety in their building;</li>
  <li>lacked access to key building safety information</li>
  <li>struggled to get their complaints addressed</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bill provides clear routes to resolve issues, raised by residents, about the assessment and management of building safety risks.</p>

<h2>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<h3>The Accountable Person</h3>

<p>Residents will have a stronger voice in the management of their building, ensuring that they have an important role in the safety of their building, including in identifying when things have or are going wrong and being able to hold those responsible for their safety to account.</p>

<p>The Accountable Person will have a legal obligation to ensure residents are informed about, and are involved in decisions that concern the safety of their building. They will also be required to provide, upon request, information that helps to ensure that residents are able to better understand and be able to be further informed about how the safety of their building is managed.</p>

<p>They will be legally responsible for ensuring that the fire and structural safety of high- rise buildings are properly managed. They will be accountable to residents and to the newly appointed Building Safety Regulator which has powers to require compliance and sanction the Accountable Person.</p>

<p>The Principal Accountable Person in any building will be required to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Produce a Residents’ Engagement Strategy that promotes residents’ engagement and involvement in decision-making about the management of their building in relation to the risks of fire and structural failure. It will also explain how residents will be consulted and how the effectiveness of the strategy will be measured; and</li>
  <li>Establish a complaints system that ensures residents’ safety concerns are heard and dealt with. 
The requirements on the Accountable Person ensure that residents are informed about the management of their safety, are able to have a strong voice in their safety, have their complaints heard and for things to be put right when they go wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure residents’ complaints are taken seriously, the regulator will have a complaints system, where residents can escalate their complaints further if they feel they are not being addressed by the Accountable Person. We will set out, through regulations, more detail on how a complaint can be made to the regulator. However, we are clear that it will provide residents with the assurance that their concerns will be taken seriously.</p>

<p><strong>The Duties of Residents</strong></p>

<p>Residents have an important part to play in the safety of their building, with a responsibility to make sure their actions do not undermine the safety of others. The majority of residents already fulfil their obligations and work with their landlord.</p>

<p>We expect that the combination of better information and improved engagement by the Accountable Person will increase residents’ cooperation with the Accountable Person and help ensure that all residents understand the important role they can play in keeping their home, surroundings near to their homes and the building they live in safe.  </p>

<p>To ensure the safety of residents and that the Accountable Person is able to effectively assess and manage their building’s safety risks, we are placing three, clear and proportionate obligations on residents. The obligations are intended to foster and promote the safety of residents and will complement the work of the Accountable Person, helping them to ensure the safety of the building and that all residents are safe.
Residents must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not act in a way that creates a significant risk of fire or structural failure</li>
  <li>not interfere with a relevant safety item</li>
  <li>comply with a request by the Accountable Person for information reasonably required to perform their duties to assess and manage building safety risks</li>
</ul>

<p>For the majority of residents these duties will be a formalisation of what they already do.</p>

<p>To ensure the safety of all residents we are also providing the Accountable Person with the power to ensure compliance with the obligations. In the case where a resident falls short of their obligations, the Accountable Person can issue a contravention notice. An accountable person may also require access to a residents’ premises, strictly to fulfil their duties relating to building safety or to determine whether a residents’ duty has been contravened.</p>

<h2>What are the benefits residents will see?</h2>

<p>Residents will have confidence in the safety of their building and will have a greater say in how their buildings are being managed. This will involve greater accountability on those that manage the building:  the Accountable Person will have clear responsibilities overseen by the Regulator. A new engagement strategy will be mandatory, requiring Accountable Persons to promote the participation of all residents in the decision-making about their building and, residents will be able to receive further information about the safety measures in place for their building upon request from the Accountable Person. Residents will be able to hold their Accountable Person to account, being able to have their complaint heard by the regulator if they are not satisfied that their issue has been resolved.</p>

<h2>How will the Residents’ Engagement Strategy work?</h2>

<p>Residents will be at the heart of the decisions being made about their safety. The Principal Accountable Person must produce a strategy that promotes the participation of residents in the decision-making process about the building safety risks in their building. Every resident will be provided with a copy of the strategy.</p>

<p>The strategy will contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what information will be provided to residents</li>
  <li>what residents will be consulted on</li>
  <li>how residents’ views will be sought</li>
  <li>how the effectiveness of the strategy will be measured</li>
</ul>

<p>We are continuing work, engaging with the representatives of residents, on guidance for the Accountable Persons about the content of the Residents’ Engagement Strategy to ensure that it is clear for all residents.</p>

<h2>What information can residents request?</h2>

<p>Residents will be kept informed about the safety of their building, receiving mandatory information about their building’s safety and will also be able to request further information from their Accountable Person (so long as its disclosure would not contravene data protection legislation).</p>

<p>We are continuing work, working with the representatives of residents, on the further information that can be provided on request. We are clear that the additional information should help residents to better understand the assessment and management of safety in their building.</p>

<p>If a request is ignored, residents will be able to use the complaints system.</p>

<h2>How will you ensure that residents have their concerns and complaints effectively resolved?</h2>

<p>To ensure that residents are able to hold their Accountable Person to account, the Principal Accountable Person will be responsible for ensuring they have a clear and effective building safety complaints process for residents. We are also requiring the new Building Safety Regulator to have its own complaints system, which provides a further protection for residents and ensures their concerns and safety are taken seriously.</p>

<p>We are continuing work on both the Accountable Persons and Building Safety Regulator’s complaints systems. We are working with representatives of residents to design the process for raising safety concerns, the timescales for dealing with a complaint, as well as when a referral or direct complaint to the Building Safety Regulator should be made.</p>

<p>When can a resident escalate a complaint to the Building Safety Regulator, and can they go straight to them?
Residents are encouraged to raise their concerns with the appropriate Accountable Person in the first instance. We are continuing work on the process for complaints going to the regulator, which will be set out in due course.</p>

<h2>What is a relevant safety item?</h2>

<p>A ‘relevant safety item’ means anything which forms part of the common parts of the building that improves that building’s safety, for example signage, sprinklers, fire extinguishers etc.</p>

<h2>How will the Accountable Person pursue resident compliance with their duties?</h2>

<p>To ensure that residents don’t put others or their own safety at risk, the Accountable Person will have the power to issue contravention notices where it appears to them that the resident has not adhered to, or is not adhering to, their obligations. The notice will be clear on what the contravention is, the actions the resident should take, and steps the Accountable Person may take on non-compliance.</p>

<p>In the case where a resident has interfered with a relevant safety item, they can be asked to pay a reasonable sum for its repair or replacement. The Accountable Person will be able to escalate the notice to the county court if the resident continues not to comply.</p>

<h2>Why are you allowing the Accountable Person to access someone’s home?</h2>

<p>To ensure the safety of residents and the building, the Accountable Person may request access to a residential unit or other premises in the building for the purpose of assessing or managing building safety risks or determining whether a residents’ duty has been contravened.</p>

<p>To ensure residents are aware of any access and that the Accountable Person carries this out in an appropriate manner, we have set out that they must provide a written request setting out the purpose and an explanation of why access is required, providing at least 48 hours’ notice with access required at a reasonable time. Where a resident refuses access, the Accountable Person is able, as long as they have followed the correct procedure, to apply to the county court for an order to gain access.</p>

<h2>What measures are in place to oversee the Accountable Person’s actions in relation to residents?</h2>

<p>We expect the Accountable Person to be proportionate in ensuring residents’ compliance with their duties. The Building Safety Regulator, in consultation with the residents panel, is able to issue guidance to Accountable Persons about the actions they take in relation to residents.</p>

<p>If a resident does not agree with the Accountable Person’s use of a contravention notice or request for access they can refuse to comply. If the Accountable Person applies to the county court, the resident will be able to set out their position to an independent judge. They are also able to formally raise an issue concerning the Accountable Person’s action through the Accountable Person’s complaints process and escalate it to the Building Safety Regulator.</p>

<p>We will work with representatives of residents on how a contravention notice can be given and residents will have recourse to the Building Safety Regulator and the judgement of the county court.</p>
