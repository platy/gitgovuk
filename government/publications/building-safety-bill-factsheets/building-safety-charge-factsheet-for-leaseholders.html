<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Bill establishes new legal duties for landlords and building owners of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/buildings-included-in-the-new-more-stringent-regulatory-regime-factsheet">high rise residential buildings of 18 metres or at least 7 storeys</a> to keep their building safe. There will be a cost associated with some of these duties, which can be passed to leaseholders through a new Building Safety Charge.</p>

<h2>Who does the Building Safety Charge apply to?</h2>

<p>Leaseholders with leases over 7 years or more, regardless of whether they are an owner occupier or renting to a tenant, in a high-rise multi-occupied building covered by the Bill will be liable to pay the Building Safety Charge.</p>

<p>This charge will apply to a leaseholder regardless of whether their landlord is a private landlord, local authority or housing association.</p>

<h2>What does the Building Safety Charge cover?</h2>

<p>A list of the costs that can be passed through the Building Safety Charge are narrowly defined in the Bill as ‘relevant building safety measures’. These measures include, for example, appointing a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/building-safety-manager-factsheet">Building Safety Manager</a> or preparing a [residents’ engagement]
(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/residents-voice-factsheet) strategy.</p>

<h2>How much will it cost?</h2>

<p>The average monthly cost to a leaseholder is estimated to be between £9 and £26 via the Building Safety Charge. You can find <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/impact-assessment-factsheet">more information on costs</a>.</p>

<p>We would expect many building owners to already be undertaking a robust  assessment and management of risk, engaging residents effectively, and managing information about their building well. Therefore, some of the costs illustrated in the Building Safety Charge may already be incurred as part of standard practice. Those costs will be re-categorised as payable through the Building Safety Charge and will be partially offset by a corresponding reduction in service charge costs.</p>

<h2>Why are leaseholders paying for the Building Safety Charge?</h2>

<p>It is common for leaseholders to contribute to routine maintenance costs, building repairs and refurbishments through the service charge. Leaseholders will directly benefit from the Building Safety Charge, ensuring that their building is safe.</p>

<h2>Why are leaseholders paying for the Building Safety Charge?</h2>

<p>It is common for leaseholders to contribute to routine maintenance costs, building repairs and refurbishments through the service charge. Leaseholders will directly benefit from the Building Safety Charge, ensuring that their building is safe.</p>

<h2>What routes to redress are there for leaseholders?</h2>

<p>Leaseholders will have the right to challenge the reasonableness of the Building Safety Charge, in the same way service charges can be challenged.</p>

<h2>What protections are there for leaseholders?</h2>

<p>The Building Safety Charge increases transparency on the costs charged in relation to building safety. It is intended that landlords must provide leaseholders with information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>what building safety measures have been carried out and the costs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the charges payable by and received from individual leaseholders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any financial contributions towards the costs received or made by the landlord</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any remaining balance in the account, which must be used towards charges in the next annual accounting period</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are also rights for leaseholders to request further information about the charge. Leaseholders will be able make a written request to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/accountable-persons-factsheet">Accountable Person</a> (or to any <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/special-measures-factsheet">special measures manager</a> to supply them with a summary of the relevant building safety costs.</p>

<p>The Bill sets out what costs can and cannot be passed on in the Building Safety Charge. For example, the costs of enforcement action against a building owner by the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/building-safety-regulator-factsheet">Building Safety Regulator</a> can never be passed to leaseholders, either through this charge or any other service charge.</p>

<p>This will mean there is a clear audit trail flowing from the statutory duties through the measures taken and the associated costs incurred. Leaseholders will be able to interrogate charges, voice their opinion on proposed contracts and challenge the reasonableness of costs incurred.</p>

<h2>What happens if leaseholders don’t pay the Building Safety Charge?</h2>

<p>Leaseholders who struggle to pay their Building Safety Charge will be encouraged to speak to their landlord as soon as possible. Unless an individual lease provides otherwise, leaseholders may be pursued for payment in the same way as they can be pursued for non-payment of their service charge.</p>
