<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>To ensure that the Architects Registration Board (ARB) has the resource to deliver its services and to minimise impact on the annual retention fee, in particular for those architects that do not utilise additional services relating to the regulation of architects, the government will amend the Architects Act 1997 to enable the ARB to charge for additional services.</p>

<p>An example of a potential additional charge would be for a UK architect who wishes to register abroad. This charge will cover, on a cost recovery basis, the provision of evidence for registration and the ARB’s liaison with international regulators.</p>

<h2>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<p>The government will introduce a power in the Building Safety Bill to allow the ARB to charge for additional services. This will extend the currently limited list of chargeable services the ARB can administer, as set out in the Architects Act 1997.</p>

<p>The government wishes to minimise the impact on the annual retention fee so this extended charging regime is intended to ensure the ARB has the resources it needs to deliver additional services. As stated in the government response to the consultation, fees would be designed to recover full costs and not intended to make a profit.</p>

<p>The government will implement this charging regime in secondary legislation, providing clarity on the additional services for which the ARB may charge. This will mean that the ARB would only be able to charge for services listed in the legislation.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Part A of the consultation on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-architects-act-1997/proposed-amendments-to-the-regulation-of-architects">proposed amendments to the regulation of architects</a> built on the recommendations from Dame Judith Hackitt’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-hackitt-review">Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety</a>. The government accepted all the independent review’s findings and recommendations and is bringing forward fundamental reforms of the entire regulatory system through the Building Safety Bill, which places greater accountability and responsibility for fire and structural safety issues throughout the lifecycle of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/building-safety-bill-factsheets/buildings-included-in-the-new-more-stringent-regulatory-regime-factsheet">buildings in scope of the new regulatory regime for building safety</a>, including in the building’s design phase.</p>

<p>Currently there is a limited list of services for which the Architects Registration Board’s (ARB) Board can charge. These are set out in the Architects Act 1997. The cost of the majority of the ARB’s functions is currently met by registration and annual retention fees for the architects register under section 8 of the Architects Act 1997. This is charged by the ARB to all architects to maintain regulated status.</p>

<h2>How will the list of additional services be determined?</h2>

<p>The list of additional services will be set out in regulations.</p>

<p>We will work closely with the ARB and consult the sector when finalising the list of chargeable services.</p>

<p>We have previously consulted with the sector, both through formal consultation and a number of roundtables. These discussions will inform policy and future proposals.</p>

<h2>How will the costs be determined?</h2>

<p>The fees will be on a cost recovery basis only, and will not create a profit. The ARB will be responsible for determining the level of the fees.</p>

<p>These fees will be subject to oversight by the department, as part of our business-as-usual sponsorship role.</p>
