<p>Seasonal labour has always played a vital part in bringing home the horticulture harvests each year in the UK.</p>

<p>From 2019 to 2021 the government ran a series of annual pilots of an immigration visa route that provided 6-month visas for seasonal horticultural workers.</p>

<p>In December 2021 the government decided to expand and extend the visa route until the end of 2024. At that point, the government will assess the visa route again.</p>

<p>Due to the extension, the visa route is no longer a pilot. It will now be referred to as the Seasonal Worker visa route or ‘visa route’.</p>

<h2>About the Seasonal Worker visa route</h2>

<p>The visa route will run from 2022 to 2024 and currently allows up to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>38,000 temporary migrants to work in the UK edible and ornamental horticulture sectors</li>
  <li>2,000 visas for temporary migrants to work in the UK poultry sector</li>
</ul>

<p>The government announced this on 13 June 2022 in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-food-strategy">Government food strategy</a>. The quota for the Seasonal Worker visa route can change each year.</p>

<h3>The purpose and aims of the visa route</h3>

<p>The purpose of the visa route is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide an immigration route for workers in the horticulture and poultry sectors</li>
  <li>reduce shortages of seasonal workers in the horticulture and poultry sectors during seasonal peaks of demand</li>
</ul>

<h2>Allocating operators to deliver the visa route</h2>

<p>An operator is an organisation that has a licence to sponsor migrants for temporary work in the UK through this visa route.</p>

<p>The government has concluded that the appropriate number of operators for the visa route is 5 horticultural operators and 2 poultry operators. These operators will manage the recruitment of seasonal workers through this visa route.</p>

<p>The current operators are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Concordia (current licence expires at the end of 2022)</li>
  <li>Pro Force Limited (current licence expires at the end of 2022)</li>
  <li>Fruitful Jobs (licence continuing)</li>
  <li>AG Recruitment and Management Ltd (licence continuing)</li>
</ul>

<p>Defra will now complete a ‘request for information (<abbr title="request for information">RFI</abbr>) process’ to tender new licences to achieve these numbers. Through this process, Defra will select:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3 organisations as horticultural operators – 2 licences to refresh expiring licences and 1 new licence</li>
  <li>2 organisations as poultry operators – 2 new licences</li>
</ul>

<p>Subject to Home Office approval, these organisations will join the 2 continuing operators, Fruitful Jobs and AG Recruitment and Management Ltd.</p>

<p>Operators cannot source workers for their own use, only as a third-party provider. Operators will source workers that qualifying farms or businesses can then seek access to. This will make sure access to seasonal workers is fair and equal.</p>

<h2>Schedule for appointing operators</h2>

<p>This timetable may be subject to change.</p>

<p>11 July 2022 – Deadline to request clarification of questions</p>

<h3>Poultry</h3>

<p>18 July 2022 – Deadline for poultry potential operator responses</p>

<p>19 – 31 July – Defra assesses responses</p>

<p>1 August 2022 – Defra sends recommendations to Home Office for due diligence</p>

<h3>Horticulture</h3>

<p>8 August 2022 – Deadline for horticulture potential operator responses</p>

<p>9 – 21 August – Defra assesses responses</p>

<p>22 August 2022 – Defra sends recommendations to Home Office for due diligence</p>

<h2>Operator selection process</h2>

<p>Defra will select and endorse 5 operators. The Home Office will then consider their applications for a sponsor licence.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Defra identifies the operators</h3>

<p>Organisations that want to operate the visa route should complete the <abbr title="request for information">RFI</abbr> form. <a class="govuk-link" href="/government/publications/seasonal-worker-visa-route-request-for-information-rfi/how-to-submit-a-response-for-the-request-for-information-rfi">Read guidance on how to complete the <abbr title="request for information">RFI</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>Defra will then assess whether the organisation meets the minimum standards, including whether they can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deliver the visa route</li>
  <li>meet the immigration control criteria the Home Office requires</li>
  <li>provide an effective service to the sector</li>
</ul>

<p>A panel of Defra officials will score the <abbr title="request for information">RFI</abbr> responses. Defra will endorse operators whose <abbr title="request for information">RFI</abbr> responses score the highest. Defra will then multiply the scores for the questions by the weighting to give a weighted score for each question.</p>

<p>Defra will recommend the highest scoring applications to the Home Office for approval.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Allocation of certificates of sponsorship</h3>

<p>Approved operators will receive a sponsor licence that allows them to issue Certificates of Sponsorship (<abbr title="Certificates of Sponsorship">CoS</abbr>) to seasonal workers. Those workers can use the sponsorship when they apply for visas under the visa route.</p>

<p>The allocation of <abbr title="Certificates of Sponsorship">CoS</abbr> between the operators is determined when operators are granted a licence.</p>

<h2>The jobs seasonal workers can do</h2>

<p>Operators can only use the visa route to recruit workers for certain activities in specific sectors.</p>

<p>Seasonal workers must only be employed for seasonal roles. For this visa route, seasonal work is defined as ‘employment which fluctuates or is restricted according to the season or time of the year.’</p>

<h3>Sectors seasonal workers can work in</h3>

<p>The visa route will only cover certain work in the edible horticulture, ornamental horticulture and poultry sectors. This is where significant seasonal labour shortages are being reported.</p>

<p>Defra defines the horticulture sector as work relating to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>protected vegetables grown in glasshouse systems</li>
  <li>field vegetables and tubers grown outdoors, including vegetables, herbs, leafy salads, and potatoes</li>
  <li>soft fruit grown outdoors or under cover, for example, in glasshouses or polytunnels, including strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants, blueberries, and all ribes and rubus species</li>
  <li>top fruit (orchard fruit), trees that bear fruit, for example, apples, plums, cherries, and apricots</li>
  <li>vine and bines, both twining or climbing flexible stems of certain plants, for example, hops and grapes</li>
  <li>mushrooms, this typically covers Agaricus bisporus but can also include more exotic species, usually grown indoors</li>
  <li>bulbs and cut flowers, such as daffodils, grown outdoors and indoors</li>
  <li>pot plants, such as seasonal bedding plants like pansies, violas, germaniums, and poinsettias</li>
  <li>hardy ornamental nursery stock such as Christmas trees, shrubs, roses, ornamental trees, and perennials</li>
  <li>tree and forest nurseries</li>
</ul>

<p>Defra defines the seasonal poultry sector as work related to poultry slaughtered and processed in the pre-Christmas period.</p>

<h3>Activities seasonal workers can do</h3>

<p>For the edible and ornamental horticulture sector, operators can use the visa route to recruit seasonal workers for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>crop maintenance</li>
  <li>crop harvesting</li>
  <li>tunnel construction and dismantling</li>
  <li>irrigation installation and maintaining</li>
  <li>crop husbandry</li>
  <li>packing and processing of crops on employer’s premises</li>
  <li>preparing and dismantling growing areas and media</li>
  <li>general primary production work in edible and ornamental horticulture</li>
  <li>activities relating to supervising teams of horticultural workers</li>
</ul>

<p>For the poultry sector, operators can use the visa route to recruit seasonal workers for the role of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>butcher</li>
  <li>bird or game dresser</li>
  <li>killer or plucker</li>
  <li>poulterer</li>
  <li>poultry processor</li>
  <li>poultry sticker</li>
  <li>trusser</li>
  <li>food operative</li>
  <li>poultry catcher or handler</li>
  <li>poultry vaccinator</li>
  <li>poultry meat packer</li>
</ul>

<p>Operators cannot hire a seasonal worker for work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>that requires labour all year round</li>
  <li>in offices or other administrative spaces</li>
</ul>

<h2>UK numbers of seasonal workers</h2>

<p>Defra has conducted extensive research on the demand for seasonal workers in the sector and has identified that approximately 50,000 workers are employed seasonally on UK farms.</p>

<p>The government believes it is crucial that the sector must show greater urgency in modernising its business practices through automation for labour substitution and the recruitment of domestic UK workers. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting travel restrictions led to the increased recruitment of UK workers in 2020. This must continue as the UK moves to a high wage, high skilled economy and away from a heavy reliance on overseas workers.</p>
