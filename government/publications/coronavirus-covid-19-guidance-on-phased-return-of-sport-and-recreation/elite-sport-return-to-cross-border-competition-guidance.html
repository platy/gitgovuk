<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following guidance covers Stage Four of the proposed five stage framework for returning to full unrestricted elite sporting Competition and has been produced by a working group of leading sports Chief Medical Officers and partner organisation representatives across Olympic, Paralympic and professional sports on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS).</p>

<p>Stage Four provides a set of minimum standards to progress from Return to Domestic Competition – No Spectators (RTDC - detailed in Stage Three) to Return to Cross Border Competition – No Spectators (RTCBC). Its purpose and expectation is that guidelines are considered by Competition Delivery Partners and Elite Sport Organisations, and applied to their events to deliver a controlled RTCBC for all Competition User Groups, including those requiring cross-border travel.</p>

<p>It also includes guidance for UK based Elite Sports Organisations and Individuals travelling to Competition or training outside the UK.</p>

<p>The guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation" class="govuk-link">Stage One, Two and Three</a> activity remains in place during delivery of Stage Four and this document must be read in conjunction with the Stage Three guidance.</p>

<p>All existing government and Public Health England (PHE) guidance continues to apply and takes precedence over any other standards (e.g. any specified by international Competition Organisers, International Federations or governments) unless otherwise specified. This guidance does not constitute legal advice or replace any government or PHE advice; nor does it provide any commentary or advice on health-related issues. Competition Delivery Partners and other User Groups should seek independent advice prior to implementing any RTCBC plan.</p>

<p>When considering any RTCBC, and where travelling within the UK (outside England), it is important that Competition Organisers, Competition Delivery Partners, Elite Sport Organisations and all User Groups comply with any government guidance or legislation implemented by the government authorities of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly developing situation and it is likely that this guidance and the reference sources it refers to will be regularly updated.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>All definitions in Stages One, Two and Three continue to apply, with the addition of those below:</p>

<p><strong>Cross border competition – no spectators:</strong> Competition exclusively involving Elite Athletes, hosted within the UK, where cross border travel (from outside the UK and Ireland) is permitted for individuals essential to the delivery of the Competition.</p>

<p><strong>Elite Sport Organisations and Individuals:</strong> The definition remains the same as in Stage Three, with the inclusion of overseas National Governing Bodies of sport. Where an individual elite athlete is independently attending an event, and is unable to fulfil the responsibilities that would otherwise be expected of the Elite Sport Organisation, they should consult with the Competition Organiser and/or their relevant International Federation (either global or continental) to agree how those responsibilities can be met.</p>

<p><strong>International Federation:</strong> The international/continental organisation responsible for governing one or more sports at world/continental level. For some Competitions, an International Federation may be responsible for sanctioning the Competition and/or areas of Competition delivery.</p>

<p><strong>International User Groups:</strong> Any personnel that form part of the essential groups in attendance during the Competition that have travelled from outside the UK and Ireland. This may include, but is not limited to, the Competition Delivery Partners, teams/athletes, team support staff, competition officials, contractors/suppliers, anti-doping officers, medical providers and media and broadcast.</p>

<h2>Key Principles</h2>

<p>Competitions are typically delivered in partnership by multiple organisations. Complexity is increased when International Elite Sports Organisations, International Federations and other International User Groups are introduced to the Competition environment. It is important that all User Groups work collectively to ensure that the Competition can be staged safely. It is critical that the roles, responsibilities and command, control and coordination arrangements between the Competition Delivery Partners and the Elite Sport Organisation(s) are agreed at the outset, including consideration of the role of the International Federation(s) where appropriate, and any requirements of International Elite Sport Organisations/Individuals.</p>

<p>In some instances, the Competition Organiser may contract directly with the International Elite Athletes. When this occurs, the Competition Organiser must communicate with each Elite Athlete individually to ensure that: (a) the guidelines are clearly communicated to individual Elite Athletes and that they fully understand their responsibilities, and; (b) Elite Athletes are appropriately educated about the risks associated with attending the Competition (in advance of travelling) and the mitigation measures which have been put in place by Competition Delivery Partners (before the Competition).</p>

<p>As with the Stage Three guidance, the following key principles continue to apply for Stage Four:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Social distancing (SD) as reflected in government guidance should be maintained at all times between the competing athletes, their support staff and personnel from all other User Groups in the Competition Venue. Where SD is not possible, including on the field of play and in team areas, additional risk and mitigation strategies must be put in place</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attendance at the Competition should be restricted to those individuals that are essential to the delivery of the Competition, and which are accredited by the Competition Organiser. Spectators will not be permitted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All User Groups, including any attendees from outside of the UK, should be appraised of risk and mitigation plans and given the opportunity to actively ‘opt in’ to RTCBC by way of written consent</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Competition Delivery Partners retain the right to remove any individuals from the Competition Venue if their actions are viewed to breach any health and safety protocols (COVID-19 related or otherwise) and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Appropriate risk mitigation through screening of individuals prior to entry into the Competition Venue must be implemented and this may include, but not be limited to, COVID-19 symptom questionnaires. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 testing prior to entry to the UK</a> is mandatory.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Stage Four guidance places no additional requirements, particularly in relation to the testing and screening processes, on International User Groups attending the Competition over and above the requirements of entry to the UK, as supplemented by the UK government’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/568" rel="external">Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020</a> (as amended, “the Regulations”). There is a general obligation for people who arrive in England to self-isolate for 10 days.</p>

<p>Competition Organisers may seek to be listed as a “specified competition” where, subject to meeting strict criteria, accredited attendees may be exempt from self-isolation requirements to enable them to participate in or help deliver the specified competition. It will be the responsibility of the Competition Organiser to agree any listing of their event as a “specified competition” directly with the UK government (DCMS). This must be done at the event planning stage, and DCMS requires at least 6 weeks’ notice of any event taking place for due consideration as to whether legislation should be amended so that the event becomes a “specified competition” for the purposes of the Regulations. All other Competitions, and attendees of other competitions, must continue to adhere to the Regulations in full.</p>

<h2>General guidance</h2>

<p>In addition to the measures defined in the Stage Three guidance, Competition Delivery Partners and Elite Sport Organisations must implement the following (a) when assessing the viability of whether a Competition can be safely hosted, (b) throughout the duration of its planning, and; (c) during the Competition Period:</p>

<p>Make early contact with the International Elite Sports Organisations/Individuals, International Federations (where appropriate) and other International User Groups to discuss:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Current UK COVID-19 status, risk levels and government policy - including the existence of any relevant restrictions implemented at a local, regional or national level and consideration of how these may impact entry to the UK/England, planned accommodation, training, transportation, and match fixtures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If local or regional lockdowns are in place, a further discussion with relevant local and regional Directors of Public Health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elite sport guidance (Stages One to Four).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 plans and policies of National Governing Bodies of visiting international sportspersons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID-19 plans, policies and risk assessment/mitigation for the Competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational and safety plans for the Competition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any cultural, language, religious or vulnerability considerations associated with the current COVID-19 regulations and guidance, as well as any medical requirements which international attendees may have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement for Elite Sports Organisations to appoint a COVID-19 Medical Officer(s) to liaise with the Competition Delivery Partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID-19 medical protocols for the Competition and screening requirements for entry into the Competition Venue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The requirement for international attendees to have in place appropriate medical insurance and/or funding to cover routine medical and performance related healthcare such as musculoskeletal injuries, including outpatient investigation.  Insurance must include COVID-19 care if reciprocal home country arrangements do not apply. This will include the whole delegation for the duration of their stay in the UK, in order that all such medical care is provided outside the NHS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any PPE (equipment and training) that will be required for International User Groups to fulfil their role in the Competition, noting that it must comply with PPE standards as set by HSE, for use in situations as described by PHE, irrespective of whether it is provided by the Elite Sport Organisation, User Groups or the Competition Delivery Partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel arrangements to the UK, including: <br><br>- The country of embarkation of International User Groups and any entry requirements, such as visas, screening, isolation or proof of a recent negative test result, to enter the UK. <br>- All countries that the individual(s) have been in within the 10 days preceding entry. <br>- Travel and transit through international airports and specific COVID-19 risks associated with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any equipment (sporting or non-sporting) that will be required to deliver the competition and will be imported from outside the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures for arrivals/departures, accommodation and ground transport within the UK for all User Groups to ensure adherence with the law and current PHE guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirement to adhere to a code of behaviour and any sanctions in place for breaches of protocols, guidance and laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the above should be incorporated into the Competition operational plans, and risk assessments and mitigation plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The COVID-19 Officer(s) for each party should develop a risk assessment and mitigation strategy for Stage Four RTCBC, which should build upon the Stage Three risk assessment and mitigation plans. This should include the following considerations:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Ensure that all incoming User Groups and individuals have undertaken an effective educational programme to enable informed assessment and delivery of the essential training and competition components in Stages One-Three. An emphasis on the maintenance of strict and frequent personal hygiene measures will be included in all educational resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the Competition medical plans and isolation areas for suspected or positive COVID-19 cases consider the medical care and health care requirements for International User Groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that all plans, signage and instruction support the cultural and language requirements of International User Groups.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The following considerations should be made when arranging travel and accommodation for International User Groups:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>User Groups / individuals may have to remain in isolation for a prolonged period due to potential COVID-19 viral spread, local or national viral resurgence and further restrictions and/or changes in international travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User Groups / individuals may be unable to return to their home / household. As a result, isolation will need to take place in hotels / shared accommodation. Considerations including ventilation / air flow need to be taken into account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transportation of User Groups should be risk assessed and travel between the point of entry, the Competition Venue and accommodation should minimise the use of public transport in line with wider government guidance.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Additional guidance for international Elite Sport Organisations/Individuals and International User Groups</h2>

<p>International Elite Sport Organisations/Individuals and User Groups should:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Work in conjunction with Competition Delivery Partners to establish private medical pathways of care and be mindful of the impact on NHS resources and reciprocal healthcare arrangements between countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abide by the law, and comply with government and PHE guidelines at all times.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Where there is a known or suspected COVID-19 case, international Elite Sport Organisations/ Individuals and User Groups must:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Immediately inform the Competition COVID-19 Medical Officer who should have oversight of all individuals with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and ensure any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are managed in line with COVID-19 case management protocols and latest government guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competition COVID-19 Medical Officer to inform local PHE Health Protection Team and ensure that NHS Test and Trace procedures can be followed and complied with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure any individuals are placed in complete isolation and follow additional Competition COVID-19 protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that personnel report any signs of ill-health before leaving home and do not travel to the Competition Venue unless and until cleared by phone by the Competition COVID-19 medical officer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where international Elite Sport Organisations do not have a medical officer to cover the COVID-19 case response, secure appropriate medical advice to oversee these processes prior to arrival in the UK. Individual Athletes should discuss with the Competition Organisers the COVID-19 protocols and requirements that will be in place for the Competition – and ensure that they are fully understood – before travelling to the UK.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Guidance for England-based Elite Sports Organisations and Individuals travelling to competition or training outside the UK</h2>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Foreign and Commonwealth and Development Office advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Foreign Travel</a> should be followed, and periodically reviewed prior to travel to ensure that the latest COVID-19 related information is appropriately incorporated into travel plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plans prior to travel should take account of all relevant laws and guidance on return to the UK, such as a required period of isolation or self-isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 Officer and COVID-19 Medical Officer responsible for the Elite Sports Organisation or Individual(s) should liaise with the organisers of any competition to be held outside the UK in a sufficiently timely manner in order to comply with the entry requirements of the country, including any quarantine / isolation laws or guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The travelling athletes and support staff will be expected to abide by the laws and guidelines of the host country and organisation for the duration of their stay in the host country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plans should be in place, should any travelling athlete develop symptoms and/or test positively for COVID-19, to keep that individual isolated, to maintain relevant test and trace procedures, and to plan their appropriate return to the UK (when it is safe to do so in line with wider travel and public health guidelines - both in the UK and in the country in which they are competing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On return, travelling athletes and support staff should return to following protocols as agreed within their sport as per the Stages One to Three Guidance.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Annex A: Considerations for hosting elite sporting events in line with Coronavirus England border health requirements from 7 July 2020</h2>

<p>English law currently requires arrivals into the country to self-isolate. They may be able to reduce the 10 day self-isolation period through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">test to release scheme</a>. There are additional restrictions in place in respect of countries from which travel to the UK is banned (referred to as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19#travel-bans-to-the-uk---banned-countries" class="govuk-link">‘red list’</a> of countries). British and Irish Nationals, or third country nationals with residence rights in the UK, will be able to enter the UK, but they must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival along with their household. <strong>The elite sport exemptions to self-isolation requirements do not apply in relation to persons who have been in or through any of the ‘red list’ countries in the 10 days preceding their arrival in England. You can check if this applies to you in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on UK travel bans</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The law currently allows international elite sportspersons and essential ancillary organisational or support staff (e.g. coaches, medical and technical staff, and essential broadcast staff for the event) to participate in a <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/568/schedule/3/2020-07-31">specified list of UK-based elite sport competitions</a> (as listed in Schedule 3 of the Regulations, as amended from time to time) without having to self-isolate, provided they comply with certain conditions. This is in recognition that public health risks associated with these events will be very low as a result of meticulous planning and mitigation strategies, effectively operating so far as possible within a distinct bubble, or footprint.</p>

<p>The events are required to develop plans, including for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an appropriate testing regime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a clear statement on minimising or eliminating any unavoidable encroachment of social distancing within the event environment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>restricting movement to designated accommodation, training and competition sites</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact only with other accredited event participants unless for other exceptional reasons such as medical need or legal requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>presentation of accreditation to support exemption from self-isolation where required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Under the Regulations, all international elite sportspersons and ancillary support staff coming to the UK for a listed elite sport competition are required to complete the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk" class="govuk-link">public health passenger locator form</a> in advance of their arrival in England (which requests passenger and journey details, as outlined in the Regulations). They are also required to take a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-people-travelling-to-england" class="govuk-link">coronavirus test</a> before travelling to England.</p>

<p>All international elite and ancillary sportspersons are also required to provide written evidence from a relevant UK or English sport national governing body of their status as an international elite sportsperson or, as the case may be, an essential specialist (an international ancillary sportsperson) attending a specified competition. Any person who is unable to provide this written evidence will be obliged to self-isolate.</p>

<p>On arrival in England, international elite sportspersons and ancillary staff are required to proceed directly to the event site and remain in isolation with other people within that sporting bubble, or may proceed to other accommodation and self-isolate outside the sporting bubble, until they leave England. The Regulations recognise that the competitions (or training for the competitions) may be taking place on multiple sites, and travel between them and any place where the sportsperson may be self-isolating is permitted. Once the event or competition has concluded, should the athlete remain in the UK they will be required to self-isolate for whatever period remains up to 10 days from when they entered the country.</p>

<p>The Regulations also exempt domestic elite sportspersons and essential sport ancillary staff (not including domestic broadcast staff and journalists) from the duty to self-isolate on their return to England from an elite sports event after travelling to or through a non-exempt country. This is in recognition that they will be operating under the government’s Stages One to Four elite sport guidance (including appropriate testing and monitoring health protocols). UK elite sportspersons based abroad returning to England for elite sport training or competition are also exempt from the requirement to self-isolate, in recognition that they will also be operating under the Stages One to Four guidance.</p>

<p>The non-exhaustive list of ancillary sportspersons includes: operational staff essential to the running of an elite sports event; event officials and referees; sports team medical, logistical, technical and administration staff; individual sportsperson medical and technical support staff; horse grooms and trainers; motorsport mechanics and technical staff; and the parent or carer of an elite sportsperson under the age of 18. The Regulations explicitly include incoming international media who are accredited to cover specified competitions in the UK, but do not include domestic media looking to cover overseas events which take place in (or involve travelling through) a non-exempt country or territory.</p>

<p>The Regulations have been updated (from 10 February 2021) so that domestic elite sportspersons (and their essential ancillary support) continue be exempt from the duty to self-isolate on return to England, if they have been overseas to participate in training for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. Training for any other purpose (apart from for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games) is no longer covered by this exemption.</p>

<p>The Regulations have also been updated (from 10 February 2021) to remove previous provisions allowing for exemptions in respect of new signings to elite sports clubs; medicals; and multinational ancillary sportspersons.</p>

<h2>For Event Organisers</h2>

<h3>Principles</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>All participants must be accredited and identifiable. This is particularly important should NHS test and trace protocols  and the sports own protocols need to be engaged. Confirmation of their accreditation will also be required at various points in their journey including at their point of entry to the event footprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement of participants should be strictly limited. Participants are expected to only move between event travel hubs, accommodation, training, and competition venues - this will effectively be a ‘bubble’ environment. Where this transit is lengthy, steps should be taken to carefully limit contact with anyone beyond the event staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to all elements of the bubble should be strictly controlled. This should be in line with the government’s Stage Three guidance on the return to competition behind closed doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehensive guidance (more details below) for each specific event must be produced and reviewed by the relevant local <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directors-of-public-health-in-england--2/directors-of-public-health-in-england" class="govuk-link">Director of Public Health</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear communication of the requirements imposed by the law and guidance must be provided to all participants so they are in no doubt about their responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plans for rapid curtailment or cancellation of an event should either the overarching threat level increase, or a local concern arise.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Guidance</h3>

<p>Events must have established their own protocols, in line with published government <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-phased-return-of-sport-and-recreation">elite sport guidance</a> and any relevant sport specific protocols issued by their national, or international, governing body.</p>

<p>Event-specific protocols must set out how accredited participants entering the country will be expected to act in accordance with general travel health requirements.</p>

<p>This should include detail on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>an appropriate testing regime</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a clear statement on minimising or eliminating any unavoidable encroachment of social distancing within the event environment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>restricting movement to designated accommodation, training and competition sites</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact only with other accredited event participants unless for other exceptional reasons such as medical need or legal requirements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>presentation of accreditation to support exemption from self-isolation where required</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accountability</h3>

<p>As per elite sport guidance, each event should appoint a COVID-19 Officer to deliver against the event protocols. Event-specific protocols must set out an approach to accountability that will be applied to everyone connected with that event, including all athletes, teams and event staff. There must be clear sporting repercussions for any accredited participants acting contrary to the event-specific protocols, and commitment to referring accredited participants to the relevant authorities if appropriate.</p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>

<p>Event-specific protocols must be clearly communicated to accredited participants before they travel to the event. Events must set out an appropriate way in which to seek compliance from individuals. Individuals must indicate to event organisers their awareness of sporting, and legal, repercussions of acting contrary to the event-specific protocols and wider public health restrictions in place at the time.</p>

<h3>Notification of events to DCMS</h3>

<p>In order for DCMS to consider whether to list an elite sports event hosted in England in the Regulations as a ‘specified competition’, to allow for exemptions to the requirement to self-isolate for attending international sportspersons, the event organiser is required to contact DCMS at least 6 weeks in advance of the event’s start date. The event organiser should confirm that they are in discussion with their local Director of Public Health on their event planning, and are following the protocols outlined in this guidance. The contact point for DCMS is <a href="mailto:sportscovid19@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sportscovid19@dcms.gov.uk</a>. Additional contact points for any queries are Duraid Silarbi, DCMS Head of International Sport <a href="mailto:duraid.silarbi@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">duraid.silarbi@dcms.gov.uk</a> and Amy Pendleton <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:amy.pendleton@dcms.gov.uk">amy.pendleton@dcms.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Monitoring and reporting</h3>

<p>NGBs and Event Organisers must routinely report on the number of exemptions they have issued for elite sports events and elite sportspersons. Please get in touch with DCMS through the contact details above if you intend to issue an exemption, and the NGB or Event Organiser can be added to the reporting cycle</p>

<h2>Annex B: frequently asked questions</h2>

<p><strong>How does my event become a ‘specified competition’?</strong></p>

<p>If you have international elite sportspersons coming from abroad to participate in your event, unless your event is a specified competition, any international elite sportspersons attending your event will need to self-isolate for 10 days before they can participate. You will need to adhere to the government’s Stages One to Four Guidance for the safe return of elite sport, and the protocols outlined above (including ensuring your event plans and guidance are reviewed by your local Director of Public Health) for your event to be listed.</p>

<p>You should contact DCMS as soon as possible when your event is confirmed. Please note that DCMS requires at least 6 weeks’ notice before your event’s start date to allow time for DCMS to consider whether to list your event, and for the necessary updates to be made to the Regulations.</p>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:sportscovid19@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">sportscovid19@dcms.gov.uk</a>. Additionally, you may contact <a href="mailto:duraid.silarbi@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">duraid.silarbi@dcms.gov.uk</a> or <a href="mailto:amy.pendleton@dcms.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">amy.pendleton@dcms.gov.uk</a> in the DCMS Sport Team for any queries.</p>

<p><strong>I am a domestic elite sportsperson, and I want to attend an elite sport training camp abroad - can I be exempt from 10 day self-isolation on return to England?</strong></p>

<p>Domestic elite sportspersons and their essential ancillary support may continue to travel abroad to train for the Tokyo Olympic or Paralympic games, and will remain able to claim the exemption from the duty to self-isolate on their return. However, from 10 February 2021, other domestic elite sportspersons and essential domestic ancillary sportspersons are no longer exempt from that duty if they travelled overseas for training purposes only (rather than also for competition).</p>

<p><strong>I am a UK based journalist who wants to attend an elite sports event in a non-exempt country - can I be exempt from the duty to self-isolate on my return to England?</strong></p>

<p>No. The Regulations explicitly include an exemption for incoming international media who are essential to the running of specified competitions in England. This is to allow behind closed doors elite sports events in England to be broadcast. This does not allow an exemption for domestic media looking to cover overseas events which take place in (or involve travelling through) a non-exempt country.</p>

<p><strong>I am a UK sportsperson, but I live overseas. I want to participate in an elite sport competition or training in England - do I have to self-isolate on arrival?</strong></p>

<p>UK sportspersons not habitually resident in the UK are exempt from the requirement to self-isolate when coming to England to compete or train in elite sport. You will need to provide written evidence from your sport’s National Governing Body confirming your status as an elite UK sportsperson who has travelled to England to compete in or train for an elite sports event. This is in recognition that you will be operating under the Stages One to Four guidance when in England.</p>

<p><strong>Can elite sports coaches or other technical support staff go abroad to support non-UK elite sportspeople at events, as well as domestic elite sportspeople?</strong></p>

<p>The regulations were amended (on 10 February 2021) to remove the provision for ‘multinational ancillary sportspersons’. These were persons based in England currently providing medical or technical support (e.g. coaching or physiotherapy) to elite sportspersons in the UK, who also provide support to other elite sportspersons abroad (but not as a domestic ancillary sportsperson).</p>

<p>Domestic ancillary sportspersons are now only exempt on return to England if they have been supporting a domestic elite sportsperson at an elite sports event overseas, or if they were essential to the running of an elite sports event.</p>
