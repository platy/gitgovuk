<p>The COVID support schemes helped millions of people and businesses through the pandemic.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme helped to pay the wages of people in 11.7 million jobs and nearly 3 million self-employed workers received a Self-Employment Income Support Scheme grant.</p>

<p>The total value of claims made for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme was £28.1 billion: across the five grants, 2.9 million individuals have received a grant and 10.4 million total grants have been claimed. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme supported employers across the UK with claims totalling £70 billion.</p>

<p>Our priority was to get vital money to people quickly, to support people, businesses and the economy. We launched the schemes at unprecedented pace: just 4 weeks for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>

<h2>Compliance activity</h2>

<p>From the beginning we were clear that the schemes would be targets for fraud and that customers operating at pace and under pressure would make mistakes: that’s why we designed the schemes in such a way as to minimise fraud and error while not unnecessarily delaying payments.</p>

<p>The speed of the government’s response and how the eligibility criteria were set helped ensure that organised criminals had very limited opportunity to exploit the schemes. As a result, the assessment of losses from organised crime are low.</p>

<p>We risk-assessed every single claim before they were paid: these pre-payment checks included matching lists of known suspect organisations and devices against claims. We looked at a variety of factors, including comparing the claims to historic data (for example, pre-pandemic payroll data), third-party information and other intelligence (like calls to our Fraud Hotline).</p>

<p>HMRC blocked more than 65,000 claims worth a total of £425 million via pre-payment checks. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measuring-error-and-fraud-in-the-covid-19-schemes">Revised estimates based on new data</a> suggest our pre-payment checks were even more effective than originally anticipated in preventing grants being lost to organised crime. Other claims that were flagged as high risk were subject to post-payment compliance activity.</p>

<p>Since the start of the schemes, we have prevented more than £762 million from being lost through error and fraud in the COVID-19 financial support schemes, either by preventing losses through compliance activity or by recovering overclaimed grants.</p>

<p>This work means that, as of July 2022, the total amount of money we have either blocked from being paid out or recovered through our compliance work sits at more than £1.2 billion, with compliance activity still ongoing.</p>

<p>In addition to this figure,&nbsp;customers have made unprompted decisions to repay £970 million, either because they decided they no longer needed the money claimed, even though they were entitled to it, or because they recognised an error and returned the money.</p>

<p>Our Fraud Investigation Service investigates the most egregious abuses of the Covid-19 financial support schemes. These criminal and civil investigations are at various stages of development, and in 2021 to 2022 we made a total of 26 arrests involving the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme and Eat Out to Help Out.</p>

<h2>Taxpayer Protection Taskforce</h2>

<p>The government has invested over £100 million in a Taxpayer Protection Taskforce to combat fraud in the HMRC-administered Covid-19 schemes. To the end of March 2022, we have opened nearly 41,000 one-to-one compliance interventions and contacted over 63,000 people via one-to-many campaigns.</p>

<p>The Taxpayer Protection Taskforce is made up of tax specialists who are highly experienced in responding to error and fraud. Tackling fraud in COVID-19 support schemes is a major priority, which is why we redeployed highly skilled and experienced staff from tax compliance and recruited externally to backfill those roles.</p>

<p>The £100 million in new funding allowed us to replace those who went to work on the taskforce. The importance of a rapid response meant that transferring experienced staff was the best approach and, as of July 2022, more than 1,100 colleagues are deployed to the Taskforce.</p>

<p>We are confident that we have the right mix of experience in the Taskforce and across our compliance teams to address the types of error and fraud we have seen, which are primarily customer mistakes and opportunistic fraud.</p>

<p>We are absolutely dedicated to tackling error and fraud in the Covid support schemes. We are not writing anything off and will continue to prioritise the most serious cases of abuse. HMRC has legal powers to recover this money up to 20 years after the event.</p>

<p>Our role is to protect taxpayers’ money, create a level playing field and build public trust. That is achieved by taking action against those who have deliberately sought to cheat the system, while recognising there will be people who have made honest errors despite trying their best to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Throughout our compliance response, we’ve taken a reasonable and supportive approach to those who have made genuine mistakes - and have given these customers the opportunity to correct errors without fear of sanctions.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measuring-error-and-fraud-in-the-covid-19-schemes">Recent analysis</a> shows a pattern across the schemes of lower value risks and overall lower levels of error and fraud than expected.</p>

<h2>Error and fraud estimates</h2>

<p>We were clear when <a class="govuk-link" href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220627160855/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measuring-error-and-fraud-in-the-covid-19-schemes" rel="external">we published our provisional estimates last year</a> that we would be able to refine our estimates as we gathered more information. New data from compliance cases and a Random Enquiry Programme has given us more certainty and means we can revise our error and fraud estimates.</p>

<p>The Random Enquiry Programme covered the period from March 2020 to October 2020 and a further study is underway for the remaining period, through to September 2021. For completeness, we will then publish our final Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme error and fraud estimates alongside HMRC’s 2022 to 2023 Annual Report and Accounts. At this stage, there is no reason to expect that the Random Enquiry Programme for the later period of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will give significantly different results.</p>

<p>The most likely estimate for the value of error and fraud in the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme and Eat Out to Help Out during 2020 to 2021 is now £3.9 billion (estimated range between £2.8 billion and £5.5 billion), down from the previously published most likely estimate of £5.8 billion. Our most likely estimate of the rate of error and fraud in the schemes in 2020 to 2021 is 4.8%, whereas our previously published estimate was 7.2%.</p>

<p>Across the full lifecycle of the schemes, the total value of error and fraud is estimated to be within the range of £3.2 billion to £6.4 billion with a most likely estimate of £4.5 billion (an error and fraud rate of 4.6%). The revised estimate of error and fraud across the lifetime of the schemes is now less than the provisional estimate for 2020 to 2021 alone.</p>

<h2>Estimates methodology</h2>

<p>The estimates were put together by experienced statisticians, with input and peer review from the UK’s Office for National Statistics and international colleagues. In the interest of transparency, we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measuring-error-and-fraud-in-the-covid-19-schemes">the methodology</a> behind our estimates, as we did last year when we published provisional figures, and we will do next year when we publish the final estimates.</p>

<p>For the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, new data from the Random Enquiry Programme and compliance cases shows that the overall level of error and fraud is down, and the proportion attributed to error is higher. We’ve also found the value of error and fraud in claims made by individual employers is generally low.</p>

<p>As we said last year, a Random Enquiry Programme is not as useful for assessing numbers who may have worked while their employers claimed from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Estimating this is inherently difficult and comes with a greater level of uncertainty, which is why we have set out wide ranges around our ‘most likely’ estimates.</p>

<p>In estimating how many people may have worked while their employers claimed from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, we have used modelling techniques and drawn on analysis of our own compliance data and a range of outside evidence.</p>

<p>All estimates, by their very nature, come with a degree of uncertainty. We have recognised this uncertainty by using recognised statistical techniques to determine ranges for&nbsp;our estimates, rather than using single figures. This has allowed us to account for the uncertainty involved in estimating how many employees were working while their employers claimed from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, as well as any measurement or sampling error in the Random Enquiry Programme.</p>

<p>The National Audit Office’s detailed testing of a sample of our Random Enquiry Programme cases identified a small number of measurement errors, but our analysis of these showed that they did not have a significant impact on our estimates of the overall level of error and fraud.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the available evidence supports our estimates, which were put together using best practice analytical methods. We are confident they are as accurate as they can possibly be given the data available, and we stand by them.</p>
