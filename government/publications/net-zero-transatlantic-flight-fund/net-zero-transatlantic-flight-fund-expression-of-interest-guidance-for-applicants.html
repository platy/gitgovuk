<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) in partnership with Innovate UK has launched a competition to support industry to meet the government’s ambition to achieve the first ever net zero transatlantic flight on a commercial aircraft using 100% sustainable aviation fuels (<abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>) within one year.</p>

<p>Up to £1 million in funding will be made available from 2022 to 2023 to support the testing, research and personnel costs of the initiative.</p>

<p>An initial expression of interest will be used to inform the programme’s timescale and delivery and preselect proposals that will progress to the full competition stage to determine award of funding.</p>

<h2>Objectives of the flight</h2>

<p>Building on previous research and demonstration events, this flight will further the understanding of the technical and operational feasibility of using 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> in a commercial setting and how this can be coupled with greenhouse gas removals to deliver net zero flight.</p>

<p>It will play an important role in supporting the global <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> market, in the transition towards using higher blends, as countries around the world seek to maximise the greenhouse gas emissions savings achieved using <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Specifically, this flight will aim to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prove feasibility of running a commercial aircraft on 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> for a sustained period of time and across a transatlantic route</li>
  <li>gather meaningful data that can accelerate existing fuel certification processes and scientific research in the <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>, emissions, contrails and routes management area</li>
  <li>demonstrate options available for and feasibility of greenhouse gas removals, while that market develops, to ensure the flight is net zero</li>
  <li>prompt domestic and international industry collaboration</li>
  <li>provide a positive news story about the transition to <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> to increase consumer confidence in the safety and environmental benefits of <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expression of interest</h2>

<p>This competition is open to any airline interested in delivering a net zero transatlantic flight between the UK and the US running on 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> within the next year, regardless of where the airline is based.</p>

<p>The expression of interest (<abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr>) is the first phase of the 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> flight competition. Airlines must have a successful application in this phase before they are invited to apply to the full stage competition.</p>

<p>Only EOIs that align with the objectives of the initiative and present a credible plan to deliver a net zero transatlantic flight running on 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> within the expected timescale will progress to the full competition stage, where funding decisions will be made.</p>

<p>This means that applicants that do not participate to the <abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr> or that will not be successful at the <abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr> stage will not be able to compete for the funding available.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>There is no funding in the EOI phase.</p>
</div>

<p>At this stage, we are looking for draft proposals from parties (primarily airlines, alongside aircraft and engine manufacturers, fuel producers and suppliers) interested in delivering a transatlantic flight departing the UK using 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>.</p>

<p>Each <abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr> will be assessed by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> against a defined list of criteria.</p>

<p>At the second and final competition stage, Innovate UK will conduct an independent assessment to finalise funding decisions.</p>

<h2>Delivery and timescales</h2>

<p>To deliver this initiative, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> will be responsible for running the <abbr title="expression of interest">EOI</abbr> and shortlisting applicants. Innovate UK has been appointed as delivery partner of the initiative and will proceed to run a closed competition on behalf of <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Innovate UK will be responsible for setting up and running the competition, handling contracting and commercial aspects, addressing any issues with project progress, releasing competition funding and managing parties to ensure milestones are met.</p>

<p>Innovate UK will monitor progress throughout the initiative and conduct a post-project monitoring exercise.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The deadline for applications is 11:59pm on 12 June 2022. Send your completed application to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:saf@dft.gov.uk">saf@dft.gov.uk</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> officials will conduct a review, scoring and shortlisting process to assess whether the EOIs received align with the objectives of the initiative and have a credible plan ahead of the full competition. This will determine which parties will proceed to the closed competition run by Innovate UK.</p>

<p>We expect the closed competition to run as follows, although deadlines, eligibility and assessment criteria will be confirmed in due course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Innovate UK will run a closed competition with shortlisted parties, which will last 4 weeks and followed by a 3-week assessment phase – we expect the closed competition to open by the end of June 2022</li>
  <li>once a winner has been identified and announced, Innovate UK will enter agreements to provide funding, which we expect can take up to 3 months</li>
  <li>once the appropriate agreements between Innovate UK and the relevant parties have been signed, the project can begin – accounting for the regulatory approval and planning required, it is estimated that at best this will take 6 months</li>
</ul>

<p>The Civil Aviation Authority (<abbr title="Civil Aviation Authority">CAA</abbr>) and other regulatory bodies will need to be involved to ensure the flight can take place due to the current blending limits imposed by fuel specifications. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> will play a supportive role in connecting relevant parties to those involved in the project.</p>

<h2>Data protection</h2>

<h3>Fair processing notice</h3>

<p>The purpose of this fair processing notice is to inform you of the use that will be made of your personal data, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> is the data controller in respect of any personal data that you provide when you compete for the ‘net zero transatlantic flight fund’ application forms.</p>

<p>Innovate UK is <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s appointed agent for the purposes of administering the scheme, and it will process the data on our behalf. Some information may be shared with other government departments, their agencies and appointed agents to inform sustainable aviation fuels policy development.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> may be required to release information, including personal data and commercial information, on request under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 or the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>

<p>However, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> will not permit any unwarranted breach of confidentiality nor will we act in contravention of our obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The UK government is keen to build a world-leading <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> industry that can bring about significant greenhouse gas emission savings, as well as green jobs across the UK.</p>

<p>When fully replacing kerosene, <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> can achieve lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions savings of over 70% compared to conventional jet fuel.</p>

<p>While other aviation decarbonisation technologies, such as electric and hydrogen aircraft, may require engines or aircraft redesign, <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> can be easily blended with conventional jet fuel without requiring substantial modifications to engines, aircraft or refuelling infrastructure.</p>

<p>However, current jet fuel specifications only allow <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> to be blended up to 50% in volumes, limiting the greenhouse gas emissions savings that <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> can deliver for an individual flight.</p>

<p>While this blend limit is not the primary barrier to scaling up <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> uptake at this stage, the UK government is keen to accelerate work to support higher <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> blends to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> and achieve higher carbon savings more quickly.</p>

<p>An increasing number of research and demonstration events surrounding 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr> have already taken place in 2021 and early 2022. Primarily led by industry, these events aimed to inform existing certification efforts and proved the technical and operational feasibility of using 100% <abbr title="sustainable aviation fuels">SAF</abbr>.</p>

<p>However, many of these activities used 100% in only one engine and none of the events have travelled as far as a transatlantic flight.</p>
