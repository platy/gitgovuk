<p>If you live in the same household as a person who has symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) or who has received a positive test result, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at Home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If you have been in close contact with, but do not live with, a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, follow the guidance below.</p>

<h2>What has changed</h2>

<p>This guidance has been updated to reflect changes to self-isolation requirements for contacts of people who have been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. These contacts must stay at home and self-isolate even if they are fully vaccinated or aged under 18 years and 6 months. As with other contacts required to self-isolate, they must complete their full isolation period even if they receive a negative test result during this period. The public health advice for people with symptoms of, or a positive test result for COVID-19 remains the same for everyone.</p>

<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for people who have been notified by NHS Test and Trace<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> that they are a contact of a person who has had a positive test result for COVID-19 and who is not from that person’s household.</p>

<p>There is separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance for those working in health and social care settings</a>.</p>

<p>Contacts of a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 need to follow this advice because they are at risk of developing COVID-19 themselves in the next 10 days. They could spread the virus to others, even before any symptoms begin.</p>

<h2>What is meant by a contact</h2>

<p>A contact is a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can be a contact any time from 2 days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms (or, if they did not have any symptoms, from 2 days before the date their positive test was taken), and up to 10 days after, as this is when they can pass the infection on to others. A risk assessment may be undertaken to determine this, but a contact can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone who lives in the same household as another person who has COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>anyone who has had any of the following types of contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19:
    <ul>
      <li>face-to-face contact including being coughed on or having a face-to-face conversation within one metre</li>
      <li>been within one metre for one minute or longer without face-to-face contact</li>
      <li>been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A person may also be a close contact if they have travelled in the same vehicle or plane as a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you have been identified as a contact, you have been assessed as being at risk of developing COVID-19, even if you don’t currently have symptoms. You should follow all the guidance in this document.</p>

<p>An interaction through a Perspex (or equivalent) screen with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 is not usually considered to be a contact, as long as there has been no other contact such as those in the list above.</p>

<p>If you are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 you will be notified by the NHS Test and Trace service via text message, email or phone and should follow this guidance closely.</p>

<h2>Main messages</h2>

<p>If you have been informed by NHS Test and Trace that you are a contact of a person who has had a positive test result for COVID-19, you must stay at home and self-isolate. Your isolation period includes the date of your last contact with the person who had a positive test result for COVID-19 and the next 10 full days. This means that if, for example, your last contact with them was at any time on the 15th of the month, your isolation period ends at 23:59 on the 25th.</p>

<p>Do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, the person you had close contact with will have a follow-up <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and may be advised that they can stop self-isolating. If this happens, NHS Test and Trace will contact you and advise that you can stop self-isolating too.</p>

<p>You may not be required to self-isolate if you are notified that you are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, for example if you are fully vaccinated. There is further information on <a href="#exempt" class="govuk-link">when you may not be required to self-isolate later in this guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you are notified that you are a contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 you must stay at home and self-isolate even if you are vaccinated or under the age of 18.</p>

<p>If you develop any of the following symptoms: a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia), you should self-isolate and arrange to have a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test"><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test for COVID-19</a> either online or by phone by calling 119, even if your symptoms are mild.</p>

<p>If you do not have any of these symptoms, other people in your household do not need to self-isolate with you.</p>

<h2>How you will be told if you are a contact</h2>

<p>NHS Test and Trace will get in touch with anyone who is a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 by text message, email, phone or the NHS COVID-19 app.</p>

<h2>What to do if you are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19</h2>

<p>If you have been informed that you are a contact of a person who has had a positive test result for COVID-19, you must stay at home and self-isolate unless you meet one of the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are fully vaccinated</li>
  <li>you are below the age of 18 years 6 months</li>
  <li>you have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID-19 vaccine trial</li>
  <li>you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you have been informed that you are a contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, these conditions do not apply, and you must stay at home and self-isolate. NHS Test and Trace will contact you if this is the case.</p>

<p>Fully vaccinated means that you have been vaccinated with an MHRA approved COVID-19 vaccine in the UK and at least 14 days have passed since you received the recommended doses of that vaccine.</p>

<p>If you are required to self-isolate your isolation period includes the date of your last contact with the person who had a positive test result for COVID-19 and the next 10 full days. This means that if, for example, your last contact with them was at any time on the 15th of the month your isolation period ends at 23:59 on the 25th.</p>

<p>Self-isolation means you must stay at home and not leave the house. Do not go to work, school, or public areas, and do not use public transport or taxis.</p>

<p>Do not go outside even to buy food or other essentials, except in certain specific circumstances. Any exercise must be taken within your home, garden or private outdoor space.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, the person you had close contact with will be asked by NHS Test and Trace to take a follow-up COVID-19 test.  If this second test result is negative it is unlikely that they have COVID-19.  If this happens NHS Test and Trace will contact you to let you know that you can stop self-isolating.</p>

<p>You can only stop your self-isolation before 10 full days have been completed if you have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace and advised to do so.  Otherwise, you must continue to self-isolate and follow this guidance.</p>

<p>Ask friends or relatives to help with buying groceries, other shopping or picking up medication, or walking a dog. You can also order your shopping online and medication by phone or online. Delivery drivers should not come into your home, so make sure you ask them to leave items outside for collection.</p>

<p>Following expert clinical advice and the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, people previously considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable will no longer be advised to shield. Some people are still at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19 and may have been advised by their health professional to consider taking additional precautions. If someone in the household has been advised to take these precautions, such as maintaining a distance from others, you should stay away from them as much as possible.</p>

<p>You can arrange to have a single <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test whether or not you have symptoms. This is because you are at a higher risk of being infected. The results of the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test will help NHS Test and Trace contact people who may have caught the virus from you. They can then self-isolate and avoid passing it on to others.</p>

<p>You should arrange to have this test as soon as possible within your 10 day isolation period, so that NHS Test and Trace can identify the people that you have been in contact with. You can order a home test kit, book an appointment at a test site or by phone by calling 119. To reduce the risk to others you should only use a test site if you are unable to use the home <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing service. If you go to a test site, stay at least 2 metres apart from other people who you do not live with, and return home immediately afterwards. If you order a home test kit you should use it and return it within 48 hours of receiving it.</p>

<p>Taking a test will help find as many people with COVID-19 as possible and, by tracing your contacts, help reduce the spread of infection to others.</p>

<p>If your test result is positive, follow the advice for people with COVID-19 to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home</a> and start a further full 10 day isolation period. This begins from when you took the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, regardless of where you are in your original 10 day isolation period. This means that your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/961291/Stay_at_home_illustration_Feb_2021.pdf" rel="external">total isolation period</a> will be longer than 10 days.</p>

<p>If you have a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result during your 10 day isolation period, you must continue to self-isolate as you could still become infectious and pass the infection onto others. Stay at home for the full 10 days to avoid putting others at risk.</p>

<p>If you have previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result you are not usually advised to be re-tested within 90 days of this result. However, you should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of a previous positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>you are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</li>
  <li>you are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are tested within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result for any of these 3 reasons, and the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, you must stay at home, self-isolate and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Your household does not need to self-isolate with you if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19 or have not received a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result, but they should take extra care to stay safe and help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is very important that you follow this advice even if you feel well, as symptoms can take up to 10 days to appear from your last contact with the person who has tested positive for COVID-19. This will help protect your family, friends and the NHS. Self-isolation protects the most vulnerable in society by reducing the chance of spread of COVID-19 in the wider community.</p>

<p>If you are living with children, keep following this guidance to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.</p>

<p>People who live on a traveller site, in a vehicle or on a canal boat may have added difficulties in accessing water and sanitation. You should aim to do all that you can to reduce the spread of COVID-19 with the space available to you and your household. Further support and practical advice are provided below.</p>

<p>Not all these measures will be possible if you, or those you are living with, have conditions such as learning disabilities, autism or serious mental illness. Please keep following this guidance to the best of your ability, while keeping yourself and those close to you safe and well, ideally in line with any existing care plans.</p>

<p>Staying at home for a prolonged period can be difficult, frustrating and lonely for some people. The <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/">Every Mind Matters</a> website contains information and tips to help you look after your mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you are identified as a contact and asked to self-isolate by <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/nhs-test-and-trace-if-youve-been-in-contact-with-a-person-who-has-coronavirus/">NHS Test and Trace</a>, including by the <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01339/en-us" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS COVID-19 app</a>, you may be entitled to a payment of £500 from your local authority under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support/claiming-financial-support-under-the-test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme">Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a>. You may also be eligible for this payment if you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>You could be fined if you do not stay at home and self-isolate if you are notified by NHS Test and Trace that you need to self-isolate.</p>

<h3>Contacts who are not required to self-isolate</h3>

<p>If you are not required to self-isolate NHS Test and Trace will contact you and provide you with advice on testing and guidance on preventing the spread of COVID-19. You will be advised to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test as soon as possible. Children aged 4 and under will not be advised to take a test unless the positive case was someone in their own household.</p>

<p>If you have previously received a positive COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result you are not usually advised to be re-tested within 90 days of this result. However, you should have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 90 days of a previous positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you develop any new symptoms of COVID-19</li>
  <li>you are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19</li>
  <li>you are required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test upon entry into the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are tested within 90 days of a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result for any of these 3 reasons, and the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, you must stay at home, self-isolate and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you are vaccinated, you can still be infected with COVID-19 and pass it on to others. If you are identified as a contact of someone with COVID-19 but you are not required to self-isolate, you can help protect others by following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do#keeping-yourself-and-others-safe">guidance on how to stay safe and help prevent the spread</a>.</p>

<p>As well as getting a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>limit close contact with people outside your household, especially in enclosed spaces. Consider taking an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test beforehand if you do need to be in close contact with others</li>
  <li>wear a face covering in enclosed spaces and where you are unable to maintain social distancing</li>
  <li>limit contact with anyone who has an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19. Consider taking an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test beforehand if you do need to meet with them</li>
</ul>

<p>This advice applies until 10 full days after your most recent contact with the person who has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Taking an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test before meeting with others can help to identify whether you are infectious with COVID-19. If your <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result is negative, it is likely that you were not infectious at the time the test was taken. However, you should continue to follow the advice above as it is still possible that you are infected with COVID-19.</p>

<p>If you are a health or social care worker who has been identified as a close contact and are exempt from self-isolation, there is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">additional guidance available</a> that you should follow to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19 in these settings.</p>

<p>Children and young people aged under 18 years 6 months who usually attend an education or childcare setting and who have been identified as a close contact should continue to attend the setting as normal unless they are a close contact of someone who has been identified as a suspected or confirmed case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, in which case they must self-isolate. They should continue to follow guidance on the use of face coverings.</p>

<p>If you develop symptoms at any time, even if these are mild, self-isolate immediately, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a COVID-19 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> and follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection#symptoms">guidance for people with COVID-19 symptoms</a>. If you take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the result is positive, you should also self-isolate and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a>.</p>

<h2>I think I have had contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, but I have not been notified and advised to self-isolate. What should I do?</h2>

<p>Contacts who need to self-isolate will usually be notified and advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace, including by the NHS COVID-19 app. If you believe that you are a contact of someone with COVID-19 but have not yet been notified by NHS Test and Trace, you should carefully follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">how to stay safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>. In this circumstance you can arrange to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, even if you do not have symptoms, because you may be at higher risk of being infected.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that you may have symptoms of COVID-19, or you live with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">Stay at Home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do if you develop symptoms of COVID-19 during your 10 days of self-isolation</h2>

<p>If you develop symptoms, stay at home and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</a> for COVID-19.</p>

<p>As soon as your symptoms start, you and anyone in your household should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at Home: Guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>. If your test result is positive, continue to follow the Stay at Home guidance.</p>

<p>If your test result is negative, then you must still complete the full 10 days of self-isolation, as you could still develop COVID-19. Continue to follow this guidance.</p>

<h2>Do the people I live with also need to self-isolate at home with me for 10 days?</h2>

<p>If you are a contact of a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, but you do not have symptoms, other people living with you do not need to self-isolate. They should follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">how to stay safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do if you live with someone who develops COVID-19 symptoms</h2>

<p>If someone you live with develops symptoms, they will need to self-isolate at home along with all the other people who live with them; this will include you.</p>

<p>In this situation you should all follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at Home: Guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>I think I have been in close contact with someone who is being tested for COVID-19, but they do not yet have a test result. What should I do?</h2>

<p>If you believe that you are a contact of someone with COVID-19 who has not received their test result yet, you should carefully follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">how to stay safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>. At this stage, you do not need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Contacts who need to self-isolate will usually be notified and advised to do so by NHS Test and Trace, including by the NHS COVID-19 app. If you believe that you are a contact of someone with COVID-19 but have not yet been notified by NHS Test and Trace, you should carefully follow the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-summer-2021-roadmap/coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-help-prevent-the-spread">how to stay safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19</a>. In this circumstance you can arrange to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, even if you do not have symptoms, because you may be at higher risk of being infected.</p>

<p>If you are concerned that you may have symptoms of COVID-19, or you live with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at Home: guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<h2>What to do if you develop symptoms of COVID-19 after your 10 days of self-isolation at home</h2>

<p>If after 10 days of self-isolation you develop symptoms of COVID-19, stay at home, arrange to have a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">Stay at Home: Guidance for households with possible or confirmed COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If your result is positive, you must self-isolate for a further 10 days.</p>

<h2>Will I need to self-isolate if I previously tested positive for COVID-19 but have now been notified that I am a contact of a person who has had a positive test result for COVID-19?</h2>

<p>If you have previously tested positive for COVID-19, you will probably have developed some short-term immunity to the disease. However, it is not certain that will happen for everyone who has had COVID-19, nor do we know how long any immunity to the disease might last.</p>

<p>If you are notified that you are a contact of someone who has had a positive test result for COVID-19, you must immediately self-isolate and follow this guidance.</p>

<h2>Practise good hand and respiratory hygiene and keep your home well ventilated</h2>

<p>Everyone should practise good hand and respiratory hygiene.</p>

<p>Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose and before you eat or handle food. Clean your hands frequently and avoid touching your face.</p>

<p>Cover your mouth and nose with disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If you do not have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand.</p>

<p>Dispose of tissues into a rubbish bag and immediately wash your hands.</p>

<p>Keep indoor areas well-ventilated with fresh air, especially shared living areas. To increase the flow of air you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open windows as much as possible</li>
  <li>open doors</li>
  <li>make sure that any vents are open and airflow is not blocked</li>
  <li>leave extractor fans (for example in bathrooms) running for longer than usual with the door closed after use</li>
</ul>

<h2>Financial or other practical support</h2>

<p>Self-isolation is one of the most important things we can do to help stop the spread of the virus and protect our friends and family, our community and the NHS. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, have received a positive test result, or have been told you are a contact with someone who has, self-isolation is the only way to guarantee you won’t pass COVID-19 to others. If you are told to isolate, you should do so straight away. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support">Find out what support you can get if you’re affected by COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>If you can, ask friends, family or neighbours to go out and get food and other essentials for you. If you do not have others to help you, there may be charities or community groups who can help in your area or your local shops, markets and wholesalers may offer a delivery service (by phone or by email).</p>

<p>Check if your neighbourhood or local community has a volunteer system that could help bring you supplies or provide other support. Ask friends or family to drop off anything you need or order supplies online or by phone, making sure these are left outside your home for you to collect.</p>

<p>The NHS Volunteer Responders programme is still available to help support those who need it. Volunteers can collect and deliver shopping, medication and other essential supplies and can also provide a regular friendly phone call. Call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm, 7 days a week to self-refer or visit <a href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS Volunteer Responders</a> for further information. There may also be other voluntary or community services in your local area that you can access for support.</p>

<p>If you are unable to work due to COVID-19, see guidance from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support">Department for Work and Pensions</a> to find out about support available to you. You may be entitled to a one-off payment of £500 through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/test-and-trace-support-payment-scheme-claiming-financial-support">NHS Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</a> if you are required to stay at home and self-isolate. You may also be entitled to this payment if you are the parent or guardian of a child who has been told to self-isolate. You can apply for the NHS Test and Trace Support Payment online or through the <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01339/en-us" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS COVID-19 app</a>.</p>

<p>You will be eligible if you live in England and meet all the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have been asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, including by the NHS COVID-19 app</li>
  <li>you are employed or self-employed</li>
  <li>you cannot work from home and will lose income as a result</li>
  <li>you are claiming at least one of the following benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Universal Credit</li>
      <li>Working Tax Credits</li>
      <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
      <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
      <li>Income Support</li>
      <li>Pension Credit or Housing Benefit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Visit your local authority’s website for more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-local-help">the help and support that is available to you</a>.</p>

<h2>Additional support from local authorities for those who lead a nomadic way of life</h2>

<p>People who live on a traveller site, in a vehicle or on a canal boat may require additional support.</p>

<p>Let your site manager or local Gypsy and Traveller liaison team know if you need further support. If you are living on a river or canal, find out what advice is being offered by the organisation who manages the waterway you live on, as this varies for each one. Try to communicate by phone as much as possible to prevent spreading the virus to further contacts.</p>

<p>If you lack access to basic facilities such as water, sanitation and waste disposal to help with self-isolation, contact your local authority for assistance. They may be able to provide you with additional facilities or make alternative stopping places available.</p>

<p>The prevailing laws against <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dealing-with-illegal-and-unauthorised-encampments">unauthorised encampments</a> or unauthorised development remain in place.</p>

<p>Waste should continue to be disposed of through authorised and legal means. Guidance for local authorities on re-opening or keeping household waste and recycling centres open is available. If you need further advice, contact your local authority.</p>

<p>If you are stopping or cruising in rural or isolated areas, take note of your location if you moor or pull up, especially if you are feeling unwell. You can also use the <a rel="external" href="https://what3words.com/gelbes.beinen.freudige" class="govuk-link">what3words</a> app if there is a medical emergency and you need services to come to you.</p>

<h2>Legal requirements for self-isolation</h2>

<p>You could be fined if you do not stay at home and self-isolate following a positive test result for COVID-19, or if you are a contact of someone who has tested positive, and you are notified by NHS Test and Trace that you need to self-isolate. It is also an offence to knowingly provide false information about your close contacts to NHS Test and Trace. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a fine of up to £10,000. These regulations will only apply in England.</p>
