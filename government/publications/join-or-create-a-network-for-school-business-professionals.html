<p>This guide describes how business professionals working in schools can join or create a school business professional network. Networks help professionals to connect and share information.</p>

<p>The school business professional networks directory includes groups that provide peer-to-peer support to help with a broad range of work-related activity, including buying for schools.</p>

<p>You can find potential networks by regional schools commissioner (RSC) region. Inclusion in the directory does not constitute a recommendation by the Department for Education.</p>

<p>All levels of staff can benefit from being part of a network. A network offers many opportunities, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sharing experience and best practice between members and the wider schools sector</li>
  <li>creating an on-call community to resolve problems quickly, saving time and money</li>
  <li>getting better value for money through buying together</li>
  <li>sharing local benchmarking data</li>
  <li>linking to wider local, regional and national networks</li>
  <li>supporting innovation</li>
  <li>being a communication channel between school business professionals, professional bodies and the Department for Education (DfE)</li>
  <li>promoting local opportunities and providing peer support for members</li>
</ul>

<p>Find out how <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/school-business-manager-peer-support-improves-financial-health">a school business manager (SBM) established a peer-support network of 50 schools</a> to share innovative strategies.</p>
