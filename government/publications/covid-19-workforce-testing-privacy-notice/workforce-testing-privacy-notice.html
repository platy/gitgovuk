<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On 1 October 2021, the UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) was formed as an Executive Agency of the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and combines many of the health protection activities previously undertaken by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>) together with all of the activities of the NHS Test and Trace programme and the Joint Biosecurity Centre (<abbr title="Joint Biosecurity Centre">JBC</abbr>).  The processing activities previously undertaken by these organisations and their data processors have not changed. Individual rights are not affected by this change.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is responsible for planning, preventing and responding to external health threats, and providing intellectual, scientific and operational leadership at national and local level, as well as on the global stage. <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will ensure the nation can respond quickly and at greater scale to deal with pandemics and future threats.</p>

<p>You can read more about what <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> does on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency">our website</a>. Our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukhsa-privacy-notice">general privacy notice</a> explains the personal data we collect and use to fulfil our remit. We have also published a separate <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-privacy-information/test-and-trace-overarching-privacy-notice">privacy notice</a> explaining how your personal data may be used as part of the response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is the data controller for the personal data we collect, store and use to fulfil our remit.</p>

<p>This workforce testing privacy notice provides you with information about how we use personal data for the COVID-19 workforce testing programme. It covers the collection and use of your personal data, from undertaking lateral flow workforce testing to providing the results to <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>.</p>

<h2>The personal data we collect and how it is used</h2>

<p>As a critical part of our response to COVID-19, we collect and use personal data about the workforce of private organisations that provide frontline care. This is for the following purposes:</p>

<p>1. When you undertake a test, your employee number, name, date of birth and job title is shared with <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to ensure that the necessary risk assessments are undertaken.</p>

<p>2. Your data enables <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to produce a daily COVID-19 case report.</p>

<p>3. Your data enables <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to support employers to cover loss of earnings during periods of self-isolation for those people working on test sites.</p>

<p>4. Your data helps to populate a national testing database.</p>

<p>5. Your data contributes to national and regional understanding of the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>6. Your data assists with workforce planning.</p>

<p>7. Your data helps <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to meet legal obligations to the ongoing health and welfare of the frontline care workforce.</p>

<h2>Lawful basis for processing personal data</h2>

<p>Workforce testing relies on the following lawful bases for processing your data, in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR):</p>

<p>GDPR Article 6(1)(e): âprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controllerâ.</p>

<h3>Special category data</h3>

<p>GDPR Article 9(2)(h): âprocessing is for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and servicesâ.</p>

<p>GDPR Article 9(2)(i): âprocessing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to healthâ.</p>

<h2>How this data will be used</h2>

<p>The information will be uploaded to a national testing database managed on behalf of <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> by Deloitte UK.</p>

<p>Deloitte UK is a processor working under contract for <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and can only process data for the purposes specified by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Results of tests will be returned directly to the person being tested within 72 hours.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> will use the information provided by the employers to validate and make payments to them. If you are required to self-isolate, you will be paid via your existing payroll by your employer.</p>

<h2>How long this information will be retained</h2>

<p>The information will be held for a maximum of 8 years to ensure that the health status of the individual staff member can be monitored, and appropriate action taken to protect that staff member and take measures to contain the spread of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Emails are deleted permanently by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> as soon as possible while the attached forms are extracted from the emails and retained as per <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> retention schedule.</p>
