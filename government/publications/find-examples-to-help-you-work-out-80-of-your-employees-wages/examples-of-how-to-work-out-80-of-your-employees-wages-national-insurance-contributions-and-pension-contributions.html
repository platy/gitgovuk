<span class="number">1.1 </span>Example of a pay period spanning 2 months</h3>

<p>Employee has a 4-week pay period which is from 20 May 2021 to 16 June 2021. A Ltd cannot claim for this as a single period so makes 2 separate claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 to 31 May 2021</li>
  <li>1 to 16 June 2021</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Work out your employee’s usual hours and furloughed hours</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Example of how to work out usual hours for employees who are contracted for a fixed number of hours where the employee’s reference date is 19 March 2020</h3>

<p>An employee is contracted to work for 37 hours in each week, across 5 working days. The employee is paid weekly. B Ltd looks to make a flexible furlough claim for the period starting from 1 August 2020 until 10 August 2020 (10 calendar days). There are 2 pay periods partially in this claim period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>29 July to 4 August 2020</li>
  <li>5 August to 11 August 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>B Ltd calculates the usual hours for the days in each pay period that are in the claim.</p>

<p>B Ltd is calculating on a pay period basis so they must round the nearest number of usual hours for each pay period up or down to the nearest whole number.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#emp-ref" class="govuk-link">employee’s reference date</a> is 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>B Ltd first calculates the usual hours for the days they are claiming for in the pay period 29 July 2020 to 4 August 2020 (which are 1 August 2020 to 4 August 2020) as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 37 hours (the hours the employee was contracted for at the end of the last pay period ending on or before the employee’s reference date).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 4 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for – this is a partial pay period) = 21.14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round up or down to the nearest whole number if the outcome is not a whole number = 21.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>B Ltd next calculates the usual hours for the days they are claiming for in the pay period 5 August 2020 to 11 August 2020 (which are 5 August 2020 to 10 August 2020) as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 37 hours (the hours the employee was contracted for at the end of the last pay period ending on or before the employee’s reference date).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 6 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) B Ltd is claiming for – this is a partial pay period) = 31.71.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round up or down to the nearest whole number if the outcome is not a whole number = 32.</p>

<span class="number">2.2 </span>Example of calculating usual hours for a fixed hours employee whose reference date is 30 October 2020 and their first pay period ends after 30 October 2020</h3>

<p>An employee started work for CD Ltd on 12 October 2020. They are paid on the last day of each month, starting on 31 October 2020.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) submission notifying their first payment of wages was received by HMRC on 29 October 2020, and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#emp-ref">employee’s reference date</a> is 30 October 2020, even though their first pay period ends after 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>The employee is contracted to work on a shift pattern of five 7-hour shifts in each week. This working pattern repeats every 7 days.</p>

<p>The employee agrees to be placed on furlough from 2 November 2020 until 30 November 2020 (29 days). CD Ltd calculates the usual hours for this partial pay period:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 35 hours – these are the hours the employee was contracted for in their repeating working pattern at the end of the latest pay period for which a PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) was submitted to and received by HMRC on or before the employee’s reference date (30 October 2020) – which in this example, is 7 hours multiplied by 5 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 29 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for) = 145.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outcome of step 3 is a whole number, so does not need to be rounded up to the next whole number.</p>

<span class="number">2.3 </span>Example of calculating usual hours for a fixed hours employee whose reference date is 2 March 2021 and their first pay period ends after 2 March 2021</h3>

<p>An employee started work for an employer on 22 February 2021. They are paid fortnightly, and their first pay date is 3 March 2021. The day they are paid is the last day of their pay period.</p>

<p>The employee is contracted to work on a shift pattern of three 9-hour shifts in each week. This working pattern repeats every 7 days.</p>

<p>The employee agrees to be placed on furlough from 7 May 2021. The first pay period which the employer claims a grant for is the pay period 6 May 2021 to 19 May 2021. The employer calculates the usual hours for this pay period:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 27 hours – these are the hours the employee was contracted for in their repeating working pattern at the end of the last  pay period for which a PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) was submitted to and received by HMRC on or before the employee’s reference date (2 March 2021) – which in this example, is 9 hours multiplied by 3 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 13 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for) = 50.14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round up to the next whole number because the calculation is for the entire claim period = 51.</p>

<p>E Ltd calculates that the employee worked 1,850 hours between 6 April 2019 and 22 March 2020 (inclusive). This includes any hours that the employee received holiday pay for.</p>

<p>The employee will be paid for the pay period 13 March 2021 to 26 March 2021, and E Ltd is looking to make a flexible furlough claim for the same period (13 March 2021 to 26 March 2021).</p>

<p>H Ltd processes a weekly payroll and is looking to make a claim for the period 20 July 2020 to 26 July 2020 for an employee who works variable hours. The employee has worked for H Ltd since 2017.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#emp-ref" class="govuk-link">employee’s reference date</a> is 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>The lookback period for July 2020 is July 2019, so H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in July 2019, which is 20 July 2019 to 26 July 2019.</p>

<p>That period covers 2 pay periods in 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15 July 2019 to 21 July 2019 (2 calendar days overlap with the 2020 pay period – 20 to 21 July 2020)</li>
  <li>22 July 2019 to 28 July 2019 (5 calendar days overlap with the 2020 pay period – 22 to 26 July 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019, the employee worked the following hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the pay period starting 15 July 2019 – 28 hours</li>
  <li>in the pay period starting 22 July 2019 – 35 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in a previous year as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 28 (the number of hours worked in the first pay period identified).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 2 (the number of calendar days in that pay period which correspond to at least one calendar day in the pay period (or partial pay period) H Ltd is claiming for – 20 and 21 July).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 7 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 8.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4 is that steps 1, 2 and 3 are repeated for each subsequent identified pay period. H Ltd will need to repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for the next pay period:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 35 (the number of hours worked in the next pay period identified).</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>

</li>
</ol>
<p>There are no more pay periods in July 2019 to consider, so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add them all together, 8 + 25 = 33.</li>
  <li>The outcome is a whole number, so does not need to be rounded up to the next number.</li>

<p>H Ltd processes a fortnightly payroll and is looking to make a claim for the period 1 March 2021 to 14 March 2021 for an employee who works variable hours. The employee has worked for H Ltd since 2017.</p>

<p>The lookback period for March 2021 is March 2019, so H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in March 2019, which is 1 March 2019 to 14 March 2019. That period covers 2 pay periods in 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>18 February 2019 to 3 March 2019 (3 calendar days overlap with the 2021 pay period – 1 March 2021 to 3 March 2021)</li>

<ul>
  <li>in the pay period starting 18 February 2019 – 52 hours</li>
  <li>in the pay period starting 4 March 2019 – 44 hours</li>

<p>H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in a previous year as follows:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 14 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 19.5.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4 is that steps 1, 2 and 3 are repeated for each subsequent identified pay period. H Ltd will need to repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for the next pay period:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with 44 (the number of hours worked in the next pay period identified).</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 14 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 34.6.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are no more pay periods in March 2019 to consider, so:</p>

<p>K Ltd pays all of their employees weekly each Friday and puts all of their employees on furlough from Wednesday 2 June 2021 until Wednesday 30 June 2021.</p>

<p>The first pay period in the claim period ends on Friday 4 June 2021. The employees were only furloughed for 3 days in this pay period, so K Ltd will need to calculate the maximum wage amount using the daily calculation. This is £83.34 multiplied by 3 days, which is £250.02.</p>

<p>For the next pay period, 5 June 2021 to 11 June 2021, the maximum amount is £576.92 because the pay period is a whole week, and the employee is furloughed on each day.</p>

<p>The following pay periods, 12 June 2021 to 18 June 2021 and 19 June 2021 to 25 June 2021, are also whole weeks so the maximum amount for each of those periods is £576.92.</p>

<p>The remaining part of the claim period, 26 June 2021 to 30 June 2021, is not a whole week so K Ltd will need to calculate the maximum wage amount using the daily calculation. This is £83.34 multiplied by 5 days, which is £416.70.</p>

<p>K Ltd makes a claim for 2 June 2021 to 30 June 2021. The maximum wage amount is the total of the amounts for each pay period: £250.02 + £576.92 + £576.92 + £576.92 + £416.70 = £2,397.48</p>

<span class="number">3.19 </span>Example of how to calculate minimum furlough pay for an employee who is flexibly furloughed</h3>

<p>T Ltd’s employee has been furloughed continuously since 1 May 2020. The employee is paid calendar monthly. From 1 July 2020, the employee returns to work part-time for T Ltd and is furloughed for the rest of their usual hours. T Ltd makes a flexible furlough claim for 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020.</p>

<p>T Ltd has calculated that the employee’s usual hours from 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 are 164. The employee actually works 80 hours, and is therefore furloughed for the remaining 84 usual hours. T Ltd has calculated that 80% of the employee’s usual wages is £1,800. The maximum wage amount is £2,500 as the claim is for a full month.</p>

<p>T Ltd calculates the minimum furlough pay:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with £1,800 – this is the lesser of 80% of the employee’s usual wages (£1,800) and the maximum wage amount (£2,500).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 84 – this is the employee’s furloughed hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 164 – this is the employee’s usual hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>T Ltd must pay the employee £921.95 for the time they are on furlough. T Ltd can choose to pay the employee more than this for the time they are furloughed, but does not have to. T Ltd will next need to calculate how much of the minimum furlough pay it can claim for.</p>

<p>U Ltd’s employee has been furloughed continuously since 15 April 2020. The employee is paid calendar monthly. U Ltd makes a claim for 1 November to 30 November 2020. U Ltd has calculated that the minimum furlough pay for this period is £1,500, which is 80% of the employee’s usual wages.</p>

<p>U Ltd can claim a grant of £1,500 towards its employee’s wages, which is the full 80% of usual wages. U Ltd must pay the employee the minimum furlough pay amount of £1,500, and can choose to pay more than this but does not have to.</p>

<p>U Ltd cannot claim a grant towards the cost of any employer National Insurance contributions or employer pension contributions.</p>

<p>R Ltd’s employee has been furloughed continuously since 1 May 2021. The employee is paid calendar monthly. R Ltd makes a claim for 1 July 2021 to 31 July 2021. R Ltd has calculated that the minimum furlough pay for this period is £1,500, which is 80% of the employee’s usual wages.</p>

<p>R Ltd calculates how much it can claim for its employee’s furlough pay:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with £1,500 – this is the minimum furlough pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 80.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 70 – because the claim period is in July 2021.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>R Ltd can claim a grant of £1,312.50 towards its employee’s wages. However, R Ltd must pay the employee the minimum furlough pay amount of £1,500, and can choose to pay more than this but does not have to.</p>

<span class="number">3.22 </span>Example of how to work out 80% of wages for an employee with annual pay whose reference date is 19 March 2020</h3>

<p>The director of V Ltd is paid a fixed amount of £8,000 each year on 31 December, for the period 1 January to 31 December (the calendar year).</p>

<p>The director was first furloughed on 1 April 2020. While the director was furloughed, V Ltd paid them their wages monthly rather than on an annual basis. As a result, the director received several payments of earnings that were notified on an RTI submission between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>V Ltd furloughs the director again for the period 1 November to 30 November 2020 and makes a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme claim for the director, for this period. Their reference date is 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>V Ltd calculates 80% of the employee’s wages:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the wages payable to your employee in the last pay period ending on or before the employee’s reference date – if you’re claiming for a full pay period, skip to step 4. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#emp-ref">employee’s reference date</a> is 19 March 2020, and the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020 was the year to 31 December 2019 – the wages payable in this period were £8,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 366 (the total number of days in the pay period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 30 (the number of furlough days in November).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>£8,000 ÷ 366 × 30 × 80% = £524.59</p>

<span class="number">3.23 </span>Example of how to work out 80% of wages for an employee with annual pay whose reference date is 30 October 2020</h3>

<p>The director of W Ltd is paid a fixed amount of £7,500 each year on 30 March, for the period 6 April to 5 April (the tax year).</p>

<p>The director could not be claimed for under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> prior to 1 November 2020, because they did not receive a payment of earnings in the tax year 2019-2020 which was reported through RTI by 19 March 2020. They were paid £7,500 on 30 March 2020.</p>

<p>W Ltd furloughs the director for the period 1 November to 30 November 2020 and makes a Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme claim for the director for this period. Their reference date is 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>W Ltd calculates 80% of the employee’s wages:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Start with the wages payable to your employee in the last pay period ending on or before the employee’s reference date – if you’re claiming for a full pay period, skip for step 4. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#emp-ref">employee’s reference date</a> is 30 October 2020, and the last pay period ending on or before 30 October 2020 was the year to 5 April 2020 – the wages payable in this period were £7,500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by 365 (the number of days in the period 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 30 (the number of furlough days in November).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by 80%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>£7,500 ÷ 365 × 30 × 80% = £493.15</p>

<p>The director is not due to be paid until 30 March 2021, but employers can only claim <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> in advance if the payroll run is imminent. If W Ltd claims <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> for November 2020 in respect of this director, they will need to pay them (and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) earlier than usual.</p>

<span class="number">3.24 </span>Example of how to work out wages for different types of pension schemes</h3>

<p>An employee works for X Ltd and earns a fixed amount of £2,000 per month. The employee contributes 5% of this = £100 to an employer pension scheme, through a Net Pay arrangement.</p>

<p>The employer also makes a 3% contribution = £60. The full amount of the employee’s earnings, including the amount they contribute to their pension, should be included in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> calculation. The employer contribution should not be included. The amount of wages X Ltd should include in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> calculation is £2,000.</p>

<p>A different employee works for Y Ltd. The employee entered into a salary sacrifice arrangement in 2018. Their contract was amended and their pay was reduced from £2,000 to £1,800 in exchange for an employer pension contribution.</p>
