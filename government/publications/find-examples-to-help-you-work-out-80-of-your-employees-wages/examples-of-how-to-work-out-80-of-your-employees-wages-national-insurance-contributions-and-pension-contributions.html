<p>Employee has a 4-week pay period which falls 20 July 2020 to 16 August 2020. A Ltd cannot claim for this as a single period so makes two separate claims:</p>

<ul>
  <li>20 to 31 July 2020</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Work out your employee’s usual hours and furloughed hours</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Example of how to work out usual hours for employees who are contracted for a fixed number of hours where the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020</h3>

<p>An employee is contracted to work for 37 hours in each week, across 5 working days. The employee is paid weekly. B Ltd looks to make a flexible furlough claim for the period starting from 1 August 2020 until 10 August 2020 (10 calendar days). There are two pay periods partially in this claim period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>29 July to 4 August 2020</li>
  <li>5 August to 11 August 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>B Ltd calculates the usual hours for the days in each pay period that are in the claim.</p>

<p>B Ltd is calculating on a pay period basis so they must round the nearest number of usual hours for each pay period up or down to the nearest whole number.</p>

<p>The reference period for this employee is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>B Ltd first calculates the usual hours for the days they are claiming for in the pay period 29 July to 4 August as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 37 hours (the hours the employee was contracted for at the end of their reference period)</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 4 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for – this is a partial pay period) = 21.14</li>
  <li>Round up or down to the nearest whole number if the outcome is not a whole number = 21</li>
</ol>

<p>B Ltd next calculates the usual hours for the days they are claiming for in the pay period 5 August to 11 August as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 37 hours (the hours the employee was contracted for at the end of their reference period)</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 6 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) B Ltd is claiming for – this is a partial pay period) = 31.71</li>
  <li>Round up or down to the nearest whole number if the outcome is not a whole number = 32</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Example of calculating usual hours for a fixed hours employee whose first pay period ends after 30 October 2020</h3>

<p>An employee started work for CD Ltd on 12 October 2020. They are paid on the last day of each month, starting on 31 October 2020.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) submission notifying their first payment of wages was received by HMRC on 29 October 2020, so CD Ltd can claim for the employee even though their first pay period ends after 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>At the end of the pay period 1 October to 31 October, the employee is contracted to work on a shift pattern of five 7-hour shifts in each week. This working pattern repeats every 7 days.</p>

<p>The employee agrees to be placed on furlough from 2 November 2020 until 30 November 2020 (29 days). CD Ltd calculates the usual hours for this partial pay period:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 35 hours - these are the hours your employee was contracted for in their repeating working pattern at the end of the latest pay period for which a <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr> Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) was submitted to and received by HMRC on or before 30 October 2020 – which in this example, is 7 hours multiplied by 5 days</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 29 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for) = 145</li>
  <li>The outcome of step 3 is a whole number, so does not need to be rounded up to the next whole number</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Example of how to work out usual hours for employees who are contracted for a fixed number of hours where the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020</h3>

<p>An employee is contracted to work on a shift pattern of four consecutive 12-hour days and then have four days off. This working pattern repeats every 8 days. The employee is paid calendar monthly. C Ltd looks to make a flexible furlough claim for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 (31 calendar days). The pay period and the claim period align.</p>

<p>The reference period for this employee is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>C Ltd calculates the usual hours for the July pay period by following the steps above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 48 hours (the hours your employee was contracted for in their repeating working pattern at the end of the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020 – which in this example, is 12 hours multiplied by 4 days)</li>
  <li>Divide by 8 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 31 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) the employer is claiming for) = 186</li>
  <li>The outcome of step 3 is a whole number, so does not need to be rounded up to the next whole number</li>

<span class="number">2.5 </span>Example of how to work out the usual hours for employees who are contracted for a fixed number of hours where the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 30 October 2020</h3>

<p>An employee is contracted 37 hours a week across five working days. The employee is paid weekly. D Ltd looks to make a flexible furlough claim for the period 1 November 2020 to 8 November 2020 (eight calendar days). There are two pay periods partially in this claim period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>26 October to 1 November 2020</li>
  <li>2 November to 8 November 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>D Ltd calculates the usual hours for the days in each pay period that are in their claim.</p>

<p>D Ltd is calculating on a pay period basis so they must round the nearest number of usual hours for each pay period up or down to the nearest whole number.</p>

<p>The employee started working for D Ltd on 3 August 2020. The employee had not received a payment of earnings from D Ltd in the tax year 2019-20 which was reported on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before 19 March 2020. The reference period for this employee is the last pay period ending on or before 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>D Ltd first calculates the usual hours for the days they are claiming for in the pay period 26 October 2020 to 1 November 2020 as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 37 hours (the hours the employee was contracted for at the end of their reference period)</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the number of days in the repeating working pattern, including non-working days)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 1 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) D Ltd is claiming for – this is a partial pay period) = 5.29</li>
  <li>Round up or down to the nearest whole number if the outcome is not a whole number = 5</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Example of how to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 for an employee who works variable hours</h3>

<p>An employee started work for E Ltd in 2005. The employee is paid every two weeks and was furloughed on 23 March 2020. The employee had received a payment of earnings from E Ltd in tax year 2019-20 which was reported on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before 19 March.</p>

<p>E Ltd calculates that the employee worked 1,850 hours between 6 April 2019 and 22 March 2020 (inclusive). This includes any hours that the employee received holiday pay for.</p>

<p>E Ltd will be paid for the pay period 1 July 2020 to 14 July 2020, and the employer is looking to make a flexible furlough claim for the same period (1 July 2020 to 14 July 2020).</p>

<p>E Ltd works out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 1,850 (the number of hours actually worked (or on paid annual or flexi leave) in the tax year 2019 to 2020 before the employee was furloughed)</li>
  <li>Divide by 352 (the number of calendar days the employee was employed by E Ltd in the tax year 2019 to 2020, up until the day before they were furloughed)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 14 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) which E Ltd is claiming for) = 73.58</li>
  <li>Round up to the next whole number and because the calculation is for an entire claim period = 74</li>
</ol>

<p>E Ltd will also need to work out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in the tax year 2019 to 2020, and use the higher figure for the usual hours.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span>Example of how to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 for an employee who works variable hours and was on a period of statutory adoption leave in the tax year 2019 to 2020</h3>

<p>An employee started work for F Ltd in 2013. The employee is paid every four weeks and was furloughed on 31 March 2020. The employee had received a payment of earnings from F Ltd in tax year 2019-20 which was reported on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before 19 March.</p>

<p>The employee will be paid for the pay period 1 July 2020 to 28 July 2020, and F Ltd is looking to make a flexible furlough claim for the same period (1 July 2020 to 28 July 2020).</p>

<p>F Ltd calculates that the employee worked 616 hours between 6 April 2019 and 30 March 2020 (inclusive). This includes any hours that the employee received holiday pay for. The employee was on a period of statutory adoption leave between 1 June 2019 and 14 January 2020 (inclusive) – this is 228 days.</p>

<p>The number of days between 6 April 2019 and 30 March 2020 is 360 days (inclusive). F Ltd should not include the days where the employee was on statutory adoption leave, leaving 132 days.</p>

<p>F Ltd works out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 616 (the number of hours actually worked (or on paid annual leave or “flexi” leave) in the tax year 2019 to 2020 before the employee was furloughed)</li>
  <li>Divide by 132 (the number of calendar days the employee was employed by F Ltd in the tax year 2019 to 2020, up until the day before they were furloughed, not including the time that the employee was on statutory adoption leave)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 28 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) which F Ltd is claiming for) = 130.66</li>
  <li>Round up to the next whole number because the outcome is not a whole number and because the calculation is for an entire claim period = 131</li>
</ol>

<p>F Ltd will also need to work out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in the tax year 2019 to 2020, and use the higher figure for the usual hours.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span>Example of how to work out the usual hours worked in the same period in a previous year for an employee who works variable hours and the pay period (or partial pay period) being claimed for starts and ends on the same calendar days as the identified pay period</h3>

<p>An employee is paid calendar monthly and has a calendar monthly pay period. The employee had received a payment of earnings from G Ltd in tax year 2019-20 which was reported on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before 19 March.</p>

<p>G Ltd is preparing claims for the February 2021 and March 2021 pay periods.</p>

<p>The employee works variable hours so G Ltd needs to work out the usual hours based on the higher of either the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020</li>
  <li>corresponding calendar period in a previous year</li>
</ul>

<p>G Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in a previous year.</p>

<p>The lookback period for February 2021 is February 2020, so the employer would need to use the hours the employee worked in the corresponding period in 2020 in its February claim.</p>

<p>The lookback period for March 2021 is March 2019, so the employer would need to use the hours the employee worked in the corresponding period in 2019 in its March claim.</p>

<p>G Ltd will also need to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span>Example of how to work out the usual hours based on the hours worked in more than one pay period in a previous year</h3>

<p>H Ltd processes a weekly payroll and is looking to make a claim for the period 20 July 2020 to 26 July 2020 for an employee who works variable hours. The employee has worked for H Ltd since 2017. The employee had received a payment of earnings from H Ltd in tax year 2019-20 which was reported on a Real Time Information (RTI) Full Payment Submission (FPS) to HMRC on or before 19 March 2020.</p>

<p>The lookback period for July 2020 is July 2019, so H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in July 2019, which is 20 July 2019 to 26 July 2019.</p>

<p>That period covers two pay periods in 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>15 July 2019 to 21 July 2019 (2 calendar days overlap with the 2020 pay period – 20 to 21 July 2020)</li>
  <li>22 July 2019 to 28 July 2019 (5 calendar days overlap with the 2020 pay period – 22 to 26 July 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019, the employee worked the following hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the pay period starting 15 July 2019 - 28 hours</li>
  <li>in the pay period starting 22 July 2019 - 35 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in a previous year as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 28 (the number of hours worked in the first pay period identified)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 2 (the number of calendar days in that pay period which correspond to at least one calendar day in the pay period (or partial pay period) H Ltd is claiming for – 20 and 21 July)</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 8</li>
</ol>

<p>Step 4 is that steps 1, 2 and 3 are repeated for each subsequent identified pay period. H Ltd will need to repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for the next pay period:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 35 (the number of hours worked in the next pay period identified)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 5 (the number of calendar days in that pay period which correspond to at least one calendar day in the pay period (or partial pay period) H Ltd is claiming for – 22 to 26 July)</li>
  <li>Divide by 7 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 25</li>
</ol>

<p>There are no more pay periods in July 2019 to consider, so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add them all together, 8 + 25 = 33</li>
  <li>The outcome is a whole number, so does not need to be rounded up to the next number</li>
</ol>

<p>H Ltd will also need to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and use the higher figure for the employee’s usual hours.</p>

<p>The lookback period for March 2021 is March 2019, so H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in March 2019, which is 1 March 2019 to 14 March 2019. That period covers two pay periods in 2019:</p>

<ul>
  <li>18 February 2019 to 3 March 2019 (3 calendar days overlap with the 2021 pay period – 1 March 2021 to 3 March 2021)</li>
  <li>4 March 2019 to 17 March 2019 (11 calendar days overlap with the 2021 pay period – 4 to 14 March 2021)</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2019, the employee worked the following hours:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in the pay period starting 18 February 2019 - 52 hours</li>
  <li>in the pay period starting 4 March 2019 - 44 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>H Ltd works out the usual hours based on the corresponding calendar period in a previous year as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 52 (the number of hours worked in the first pay period identified)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 3 (the number of calendar days in that pay period which correspond to at least one calendar day in the pay period (or partial pay period) H Ltd is claiming for – 1 March to 3 March)</li>
  <li>Divide by 14 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 19.5</li>
</ol>

<p>Step 4 is that steps 1, 2 and 3 are repeated for each subsequent identified pay period. H Ltd will need to repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for the next pay period:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 44 (the number of hours worked in the next pay period identified)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 11 (the number of calendar days in that pay period which correspond to at least one calendar day in the pay period (or partial pay period) H Ltd is claiming for – 4 to 14 March)</li>
  <li>Divide by 14 (the total number of calendar days in the pay period identified) = 34.6</li>
</ol>

<p>There are no more pay periods in March 2019 to consider, so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add them all together, 19.5 + 34.6 = 54.1</li>
  <li>The outcome isn’t a whole number so round up to the next whole number, 55.</li>
</ol>

<p>H Ltd will also need to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2019 to 2020 and use the higher figure for the employee’s usual hours.</p>

<span class="number">2.11 </span>Example of how to work out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2020 to 2021 for an employee who works variable hours</h3>

<p>An employee started work for I Ltd on 1 May 2020. The employee is paid every two weeks and was furloughed on 3 November 2020.</p>

<p>I Ltd calculates that the employee worked 1,020 hours between 1 May 2020 and 2 November 2020 (inclusive). This includes any hours that the employee received holiday pay for.</p>

<p>The employee will be paid for the pay period 15 November 2020 to 28 November 2020, and I Ltd is looking to make a flexible furlough claim for the same period (15 November 2020 to 28 November 2020).</p>

<p>I Ltd works out the average number of hours worked in the tax year 2020 to 2021 as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 1,020 (the number of hours actually worked (or on paid annual leave or flexi-leave) from 6 April 2020 and up to (and including) the day before the employee’s first day spent on furlough on or after 1 November 2020)</li>
  <li>Divide by 186 (the number of calendar days the employee was employed by I Ltd in the tax year 2020 to 2021, up until the day before they were furloughed)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 14 (the number of calendar days in the pay period (or partial pay period) which I Ltd is claiming for) = 76.77</li>
  <li>Round up to the next whole number because the outcome is not a whole number and because the calculation is for an entire claim period = 77</li>

<span class="number">2.12 </span>Example for calculating the number of furloughed hours</h3>

<p>An employee is furloughed from 1 April 2020 and the employee becomes a flexibly furloughed employee on 10 July 2020. J Ltd claims weekly, in line with when it processes its payroll.</p>

<p>J Ltd is looking to claim for the employee for the period 22 July 2020 to 28 July 2020 (1 week). The employer works out the employee’s usual hours for this period to be 37 hours. The employee does not take leave in this period.</p>

<p>The employee and J Ltd agree that the employee will work 10 hours in the period 22 July 2020 to 28 July 2020. The employee works 10 hours in that period.</p>

<p>J Ltd calculates the employee’s number of furloughed hours as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with 37 (the employee’s usual hours)</li>
  <li>Subtract 10 (the number of hours the employee actually worked in the claim period)</li>
</ol>

<p>The employee is furloughed for 27 of their 37 usual hours.</p>

From 1 July, the employee returns to work part-time for T Ltd and is furloughed for the rest of their usual hours. T Ltd makes a flexible furlough claim for 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020.</p>

<p>T Ltd has calculated that the employee’s usual hours from 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 are 164. The employee actually works 80 hours, and is therefore furloughed for the remaining 84 usual hours. T Ltd has calculated that 80% of the employee’s usual wages is £1,800. The maximum wage amount is £2,500 as the claim is for a full month.</p>

<p>T Ltd calculates the minimum furlough pay:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with £1,800 - this is the lesser of 80% of the employee’s usual wages (£1,800) and the maximum wage amount (£2,500)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 84 - this is the employee’s furloughed hours</li>
  <li>Divide by 164 - this is the employee’s usual hours</li>
</ol>

<p>T Ltd must pay the employee £921.95 for the time they are on furlough. T Ltd can choose to pay the employee more than this for the time they are furloughed, but does not have to. T Ltd will next need to calculate how much of the minimum furlough pay it can claim for.</p>

<span class="number">3.16 </span>Example of how to work out 80% of wages for an employee with annual pay whose reference date is 19 March</h3>

<p>The director of V Ltd is paid a fixed amount of £8000 each year on 31 December, for the period 1 January to 31 December (the calendar year).</p>

<p>The director was first furloughed on 1 April 2020. While the director was furloughed, V Ltd paid them monthly rather than on an annual basis. As a result, the director received several payments of earnings that were notified on an RTI submission between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>V Ltd furloughs the director again for the period 1 November to 30 November 2020 and claims for the director under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. Their reference date is 19 March 2020. This means the director’s reference salary for the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension which will be the same as for the original <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr>.</p>

<p>V Ltd calculates 80% of the employee’s wages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with the wages payable to your employee in their reference period - if you’re claiming for a full pay period, skip to step 4. The reference period is the last salary period ending on or before 19 March 2020, so the year to 31 December 2019 – the wages payable in this period were £8000.</li>
  <li>Divide by 366 (the total number of days in the pay period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020).</li>
  <li>Multiply by 30 (the number of furlough days in November)</li>
  <li>Multiply by 80%</li>
</ol>

<p>£8000 ÷ 366 × 30 × 80% = £524.59</p>

<span class="number">3.17 </span>Example of how to work out 80% of wages for an employee with annual pay whose reference date is 30 October</h3>

<p>The director of W Ltd is paid a fixed amount of £7500 each year on 30 March, for the period 6 April to 5 April (the tax year).</p>

<p>The director could not be claimed for under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> prior to 1 November 2020, because they did not receive a payment of earnings in the tax year 2019-2020 which was reported through RTI by 19 March 2020. They were paid £7500 on 30 March 2020.</p>

<p>W Ltd furloughs the director for the period 1 November to 30 November 2020 and claims for the director under <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> extension. Their reference date is 30 October 2020.</p>

<p>W Ltd calculates 80% of the employee’s wages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with the wages payable to your employee in their reference period - if you’re claiming for a full pay period, skip for step 4. The reference period is the last salary period ending on or before 30 October 2020, so the year to 5 April 2020 – the wages payable in this period were £7500.</li>
  <li>Divide by 365 (the number of days in the period 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021).</li>
  <li>Multiply by 30 (the number of furlough days in November).</li>
  <li>Multiply by 80%.</li>
</ol>

<p>£7500 ÷ 365 × 30 × 80% = £493.15</p>

<p>The director is not due to be paid until 30 March 2021, but employers can only claim <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> in advance if the payroll run is imminent. If W Ltd claims <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> for November 2020 in respect of this director, they will need to pay them (and operate <abbr title="Pay As You Earn">PAYE</abbr>) earlier than usual.</p>

<span class="number">3.18 </span>Example of how to work out wages for different types of pension schemes</h3>

<p>An employee works for X Ltd and earns a fixed amount of £2000 per month. The employee contributes 5% of this = £100 to an employer pension scheme, through a Net Pay arrangement.</p>

<p>The employer also makes a 3% contribution = £60. The full amount of the employee’s earnings, including the amount they contribute to their pension, should be included in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> calculation. The employer contribution should not be included. The amount of wages X Ltd should include in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> calculation is £2000.</p>

<p>A different employee works for Y Ltd. The employee entered into a salary sacrifice arrangement in 2018. Their contract was amended and their pay was reduced from £2000 to £1800 in exchange for an employer pension contribution.</p>

<p>In the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020, they earned £1800 per month and the employer made a £200 pension contribution on their behalf. The amount of wages Y Ltd should include in the <abbr title="Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme">CJRS</abbr> calculation is £1800.</p>
