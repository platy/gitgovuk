<p>This example demonstrates the full sequence of calculation steps that an employer must take when claiming through the scheme.</p>

<p>Examples are based on claim periods using a common scenario in which the employee has a fixed monthly salary, fixed working hours, and is flexibly furloughed. They may not directly reflect your circumstances, though it may be helpful to see examples of a full calculation.</p>

<h2>Full example showing how to calculate the amount you should claim for an employee who is flexibly furloughed during the November extension</h2>

<p>Employee has worked for F Ltd since 2016, working 40 hours a week for a monthly salary of £3,000, paid calendar monthly.</p>

<p>The employee was originally furloughed on 25 April 2020 and from 1 July 2020 had been flexibly furloughed through to 31 October 2020. Pay has not been topped up and there is no bonus, commission or other additional pay.</p>

<p>The employee was due to return to normal working pattern of 40 hours a week from 1 November 2020.  However, on 3 November 2020 F Ltd and the employee agree a flexible furlough agreement to start from 4 November under which the employee will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>work half days on 4 November 2020 to 7 November 2020</li>
  <li>not work and will be furloughed from 8 November 2020 to 2 December 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>As claims cannot include days from more than one calendar month, and as it aligns with their pay period, F Ltd prepares its claim for between 1 November 2020 and 30 November 2020.</p>

<p>It will later make a separate claim for the December furlough days.</p>

<p>This employee is flexibly furloughed from 4 November 2020 so, F Ltd works out the employee’s usual hours. The employee has fixed hours and a salary that does not vary by the number of hours worked and F Ltd identifies the appropriate calculation in the guidance.</p>

<p>As the employee was on the payroll on 19 March 2020 the employee’s reference period is the last pay period ending on or before that date, so the month ended 29 February 2020.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The number of hours the employee was contracted for at the end of the reference period, the month ended 29 February 2020, was 40 hours per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the number of calendar days in the repeating working pattern. It is a weekly pattern, so divide by 7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the number of days in the pay period or partial pay period. As the employee was not furloughed until 4 November, so multiply by 27.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is 154.29 hours which, because it’s calculated for the whole claim period, rounds up to 155 hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next F Ltd calculates the number of working hours and furloughed hours. The employee will work 4 half days, each of 4 hours, so working hours are 16. Furlough hours are calculated as:</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Number of usual hours, 155</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subtract the 16 hours worked, 155 - 16 = 139 furlough hours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>F Ltd then identifies the maximum wage amount and 80% of the employee’s usual wage to work out the furlough pay and amount of pay grant it can claim.</p>

<p>The claim period is 27 days, as this is not a whole month or a whole number of weeks F Ltd must use the daily figure to calculate the maximum wage amount: 27 days x £83.34 (daily maximum wage amount for November) = £2,250.18.</p>

<p>The employee is on fixed pay, so F Ltd needs to identify the correct reference period before working out the usual wage. As the employee was on the payroll on 19 March 2020 the reference period is the last pay period ending on or before 19 March 2020, so the month to 29 February 2020.</p>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>The wages payable in the reference period, in this case the month to 29 February 2020, was £3,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divided by the number of days in the pay period, 30 days in November pay period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplied by the number of furlough days, 27.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplied by 80% = £2,160.00.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally F Ltd must calculate the minimum furlough pay, which will also be the amount of furlough grant they can claim.</p>

<p>F Ltd will use the lesser of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>80% of the usual wage, £2,160.00</li>
  <li>the maximum wage amount, £2,250.18</li>
</ul>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Using the lesser amount from this comparison is 80% of the usual wage, £2,160.00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply by the employee’s furlough hours, 139</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide by the employee’s usual hours, 155 = £1,937.03</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the minimum amount that the employee must be paid for the furlough hours (the employee must be paid for the working hours in addition to this, at their full contractual rate).</p>

<p>As the claim is for November, F Ltd can claim a wage grant for the whole amount of the minimum furlough pay.</p>

<p>For November, no grant is available towards Employer National Insurance Contribution or Pension costs, so this is the end of the calculation.</p>

<p>F Ltd checks when it can claim, which is no more than 14 days before the end of the claim period (16 November 2020 for claim period ending 30 November 2020) and, as the claim is for furlough days in November, no later than 14 December 2020.</p>

<p>F Ltd will need to make a separate claim for the furlough days in December.</p>
