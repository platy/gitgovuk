<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention; report to local police; and engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a></p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the international emergency number on 112</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-high-commission-malta">British High Commission</a>. Consular staff will be polite, patient, sensitive and non-judgmental, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell them will be treated in the strictest confidence. They can contact your family or friends for you if you wish</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Malta</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator and you are in an area where there is a British consulate, they will try to send a consular officer to support you.</p>

<p>If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform the nearest British consulate.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.Insist you get a police report and request a translation in English if applicable.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Malta</h2>

<p>The British consulate will be able to help you. This includes helping you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. They can provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with one, you can report the incident to your tour operator and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the local hospital.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you don´t report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence. A report will need to be made with the local police for an investigation to take place. You will not need to report a crime to receive medical care.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process. It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a> after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information</p>

<h2>Reporting the crime in Malta: what happens next?</h2>

<p>Only you can decide whether to report the assault to the police. If you do not know what to do, we can talk you through what it would mean and what your options are.</p>

<p>Should you decide to report the assault, it is advisable that you report it as soon as possible. The Police can gather essential evidence at the early stages without risk of contamination.</p>

<p>It is advisable that you retain clothing items and objects related to the event (such as a glass, which can constitute evidence of a spiked drink) which will become relevant evidence in support of the police report. These should be stored in paper bags for better preservation. It is worth keeping a record of any other physical effects of the abuse, such as stress or psychological issues.</p>

<p>In Malta, time baring can apply to a victim´s ability to report a crime. This can vary depending on the age of the victim and the severity of the crime. Limits range from 15 to 20 years after the incident.</p>

<p>It is advisable for you to appoint a lawyer should you wish to proceed with filing the report to ensure that you are kept informed on the case. A <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/malta-list-of-lawyers/list-of-lawyers-in-malta">list of English speaking lawyers can be found here</a></p>

<h2>The medical examination: what to expect</h2>

<p>You may need to provide details about yourself and detailed information on the aggression. This may be very personal and feel intrusive however, it is very important that this information is included in your medical file.</p>

<p>Doctors or a police representative such as a Court Expert may take photographic evidence of any injuries, when deemed necessary and collect clothing items or any other objects containing relevant biological evidence. If you have already changed your clothing, please keep any evidence safe in a paper bag as plastic can alter the samples.</p>

<p>You may undergo some routine lab tests such as a blood test, pregnancy test, toxicological tests, HIV and sexually transmitted infections tests as well as collection of DNA and biological samples. Once discharged, you may need to request a copy of your medical report and hospital file.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>Antibiotics, vaccinations and the morning-after pill might be also prescribed (the latter has to be purchased at a local pharmacy)</p>

<p>HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28 day treatment on return to the UK.</p>

<p>Please note that if you are underage, you need a medical prescription to purchase the morning-after pill from any chemist. Hospital doctors may provide this prescription. Should a doctor refuse to prescribe it, you may be signposted to a local health centre where you can obtain a prescription.</p>

<p>Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective.If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in Malta: what to expect</h2>

<p>Sexual assault and rape are codified under Maltese criminal law as a crime against the person. It may take months or years before a case comes to trial. Whilst the trials may be completed relatively quickly, the period of investigation prior to trial is led by the court and may take a number of months or years. The defendant has an automatic right of appeal.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend you appoint a lawyer. Your lawyer will be your main point of contact with the court particularly if you do not reside in Malta.</p>

<p>Your lawyer will represent you in Malta so that you are not required to be present at every court session. You may be required to appear in court for the first hearing. You may be taken to the scene of the crime, or asked to try to identify the person.</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, they take the suspect before the magistrate. This can happen within a few days of the arrest. A date will then be set for the first hearing and the beginning of the investigation period. You may be asked to make a statement in front of the court.</p>

<p>Victims can leave the country, once the case has been filed. However, you should seek advice from your lawyer and/or the investigating officer to ensure you understand when or if you will be needed again.</p>

<h2>Court procedures: what to expect</h2>

<p>Court cases in Malta can be lengthy. They involve an initial investigation period before a relatively quick trial. Hearings are normally held every six weeks in which the Magistrate hears evidence and determines whether there is sufficient grounds to go to trial.</p>

<p>Engaging a lawyer will help you to remain aware of the cases progress if you return to your home country.In Malta, victims of sexual assault are entitled to free legal services including support throughout any subsequent court proceedings.</p>

<p>Where a victim does not wish to make a police report they are entitled to access legal services in order to determine their rights.</p>

<p>It is possible for the victim to drop charges once they are filed and after proceedings are instituted before the courts. However, the court has discretion to decide to continue the proceedings against the perpetrator, giving particular consideration to the best interest of the complainant, any minors involved, and any other relevant third parties.</p>

<p>If the victim wishes to drop the charges, they cannot face charges solely for deciding to drop the charges.</p>

<p>Rape is an automatic state prosecution, but can be dropped by the alleged victim subject to the right of the court to exercise its discretion to decide to continue the proceedings against the perpetrator.</p>

<p>An alleged assailant can always press charges for false accusations. However, it would need to be proven (beyond a reasonable doubt) that the alleged victim accused the alleged assailant when he/she knew such person to be innocent.</p>

<p>In some cases, the court may order the offender to pay compensation to the victim. This may be the result of either a criminal or civil court action</p>

<p>Maltese and European citizens are entitled to claim compensation for the criminal injuries they have sustained so long as such injuries were subject to criminal proceedings or reported to the police without delay.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a sexual assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in.</p>
