<p><strong>Policy and Government Affairs:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Health and welfare:</strong> (JTS report circulated prior to the meeting)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>JTS discussed the main points in her report with the committee. She specifically requested Committee members make contact with London hospitals which are not currently accredited under the ‘Veteran Aware’ initiative to enquire if they were considering this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PL has attended the War Widows’ Association meeting in Scotland. PL had remarked that whilst in Edinburgh, the Lord Provost provided his full support, takes a lead in supporting the Armed Forces Covenant and had attended their reception unlike civic leads in other cities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Employment:</strong> (AJ report circulated prior to the meeting)</p>

<p>JME explained there had been very little activity in the last 3 months, the programme was still active and the mentoring programme was working well. Barclays continue to fund the work.</p>

<p><strong>Centenary:</strong> (RH report circulated prior to the meeting)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>RH updated the committee on the current progress. RH had been to the Chairman’s Conference with regards the suggested plans for the Centenary. Kingsley Donaldson agreed with the overall structure of the events planned. He agreed there should be a Centenary link for all VA&amp;PCs and this would enable a closer working relationship between committees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The London Guildhall event would be the main focus of the London VA&amp;PC. RH explained the Guildhall would not commit to the event until 2020. It would cost attendees approximately £100 each. RH suggested that representatives from other VA&amp;PC regions would be invited to attend the event. The Committee believed it would be of value to have a sponsor for this event and a discussion ensued amongst committee members as to who were possible candidates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>National Arboretum event will be a national activity and the Regional Chairman have endorsed this idea. Kingsley Donaldson is very keen that the West Midlands VA&amp;PC Committee should be leading on this. This will be a June 2021 event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>LV suggested a Royal Patron should be sought for VA&amp;PC’s as part of the Centenary celebrations, the Committee members acknowledged this was a great idea, however KC suggested this may bring it owns challenges as VA&amp;PC’s are not generally effectively recognised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PC informed the committee that he has agreed in principle an online article with the Imperial War Museum and RH welcomed this. Pc explained that BBC are likely to have an interest if the VA&amp;PCs can find some personal stories of where VA&amp;PC’s have helped individuals over the last 100 years. RH to action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RH asked for time at the meeting on the 12th June 2019 to agree a mission statement for the Centenary and to debate the next 10 years of VA&amp;PC’s and the value they can add. (Future agenda item)</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>LV explained there was now a second panel case the committee had been asked to review which she had recently passed on to JB. LV will follow up with JB on progress.
