  <li>WM, AWT and MS all individually introduced themselves</li>
  <li>JME also reported that whilst he was not aware of who had been appointed as the new London VA&amp;PC chair, he was aware that JB had not been successful. JME would follow up as to whether there was a possibility of JB being co-opted onto the Committee once a new Chair has been appointed</li>
</ul>

<p>This was actioned by JME</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Apologies for absence</h2>

<p>Apologies noted from AJ,PC, HB, JB, AR and NS</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Declarations of interest</h2>

WM declared she was a member of the League of Remembrance; MS declared his position with <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr>, and KC has recently been appointed Treasurer of the <abbr title="Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association">SSAFA</abbr> Somerset branch.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Minutes of previous meeting</h2>

<p>Minutes of previous Meeting – no commentary other than one typing error under MOD page 2 which should have read <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> not <abbr title="Royal Bank of Scotland">RBS</abbr>. MK agreed to alter.</p>

<p>This was actioned by MK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Recruiting for new members 2020</h2>

<ul>
  <li>JME explained that there had been a recent successful recruitment campaign, with HB being successful in being re-appointed and WM, AWT and MS being appointed to the London VA&amp;PC Committee</li>
  <li>JME explained that 2021 there would be further recruitment challenges with PC, AJ and KC all having served 3 terms and would need to go through the recruitment process gain should they wish to continue to serve on the Committee. RH would complete his second term in office and will also have to go through recruitment.  LC and JME will complete a first term in office and will have to apply for extension for a second term.</li>
  <li>JME urged all committee members to identify potential new members now and encourage them to apply when the recruitment process opens in September 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be actioned by all members.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Housing seminar reports</h2>

<ul>
  <li>PC had circulated report prior to meeting to all Committee members. JME commented PC has suggested the way ahead includes recruitment of researcher to help us through next steps but this will require funding and ‘buy-in’ by London Boroughs and other parties.  A decision will be required by late July 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>To be actioned by PC.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Centenary – RH</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Roger had circulated his report before the meeting and covered the main points at the meeting. One National Event at the National Arboretum on June 1st, 2021. More detailed plans will be required soon for the event</li>
  <li>Regional Committees who have indicated they are interested in arranging something for the centenary are doing this locally</li>
  <li>London VA&amp;PC are responsible for overall co-ordination of activities and organising a London event.  The Go/No Go decision for this will probably have to be taken by 1 July 2020</li>
  <li>There is still a desire to get support for a National documentary and PC will be co-opted onto the Centenary Committee later in the year for this purpose should it go ahead</li>
  <li>RH will need help with funds later this year – likely September 2020</li>
  <li>RH explained to the Committee that he is aware that the <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> is arranging celebrations for its own centenary next year and is keeping close contact with them to ensure no overlap. MS explained that he has had some involvement with <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr> activities and is happy to help with ensuring there is no overlap. LC has a plan to ensure no overlap with other organisations and keep in touch with MS about the work of the <abbr title="Royal British Legion">RBL</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To be actioned by LC/MS.</p>
