<p>UK CMOs will start from the position of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice on individual child clinical benefit, and use JCVI and MHRA numbers. These will not be revisited.</p>

<p>UK CMOs will consider wider issues that are relevant to the public health of children and young people aged 12 to 15 years, including education, operational and mental health issues.</p>

<p>UK CMOs will not consider issues where vaccination of children might accrue benefits or disbenefits for adults, or other children and young people (under 12 or over 16 years) by vaccinating children aged 12 to 15 years. All benefits and disbenefits, direct or indirect, considered should be for children and young people aged 12 to 15 years.</p>

<p>Membership of the group who decide the final advice to ministers will be the UK CMOs and lead deputy CMOs. The Chair of JCVI and DHSC Chief Scientific Adviser should be a non-voting member of the group. The final decision on advice will rest with the UK CMOs.</p>

<p>The Terms of Reference for the group will be published.</p>

<p>The UK CMOs will consult leaders from relevant clinical and public health bodies as needed to inform their advice. Those consulted are in an advisory capacity and are not bound by the advice of the UK CMOs, and are free to voice their independent view in public (but should not disclose the contents of discussions with the UK CMOs and others to maintain professional confidence).</p>

<p>Leaders from relevant clinical and public health bodies can commission further analysis as needed.</p>

<p>Leaders from relevant clinical and public health bodies will be asked for any conflicts of interest before contributing to consultation.</p>

<p>Advice will go simultaneously to ministers from the 4 nations.</p>
