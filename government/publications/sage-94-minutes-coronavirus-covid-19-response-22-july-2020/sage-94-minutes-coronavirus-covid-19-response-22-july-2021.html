<p>Ninety-fourth <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> meeting on <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>, 22 July 2021</p>

<p>Held via Video Teleconference</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>1.	Current levels of hospitalisations are consistent with the medium-term projections reviewed at the previous <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> meeting and are broadly in line with the roadmap modelling. In the event that increasing hospitalisations were likely to put unsustainable pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, this would need to be identified rapidly and contingency plans enacted within days, given the lag between infections and hospitalisations. Whilst there are signs that the increase in cases may be slowing in parts of the north of England, elsewhere in England cases continue to rise quickly. There is a more varied pattern in other nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>

<p>2.	Risks associated with high prevalence include hospitalisations and deaths; long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>; workforce absences (including in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>); and the increased risk of new variants emerging, as well as the increased pressure put on testing capacity. It is expected that there will be differences in levels and impact of infections between areas and different groups of people. It will be important to continue to monitor the situation carefully. Early autumn may be a particularly risky time, if a return to pre-pandemic behaviours coincides with schools and universities reopening.</p>

<p>3.	The prevalence of long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> symptoms at 12 weeks post <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection is uncertain and estimates vary by study design, ranging from 2.3% to 37% in those infected. âLong <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>â is likely to be several syndromes. Symptoms may be substantially less for individuals who are vaccinated (low confidence). There are limited data available for children, but the data which are available suggest that long illness duration after <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection in school-aged children is uncommon (low confidence).</p>

<p>4.	Data suggest that those who have been vaccinated who become infected with the delta variant may still have a high viral load (medium confidence).</p>

<p>5.	It is not yet known how long vaccine-induced protection against <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection will last but it is highly likely that it will wane over time (high confidence). It is also likely that protection against severe disease will wane, but to a lesser extent (medium confidence).</p>

<p>6.	The biggest longer-term threat to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>âs health security and response to the <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> pandemic is the emergence (and establishment within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) of variants that either have increased transmissibility, increased severity, escape prior immunity or a combination of these characteristics (high confidence). At this point in the epidemic, with a high degree of population immunity, an immune escape variant would be of particular concern (high confidence). Increased international vaccination has the potential to reduce the risk to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (medium confidence).</p>

<h2>Situation update</h2>

<p>7.	Current levels of hospitalisations are consistent with the medium-term projections reviewed at the previous <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> meeting and with the roadmap modelling. Estimates of <abbr title="reproduction number">R</abbr> and growth rate are now provided through <abbr>UKHSA</abbr> and not through <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr>. Whilst there are signs that the increase in cases may be slowing in parts of the north of England, elsewhere in England cases continue to rise quickly. There is a more varied pattern in other nations of the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. The medium-term projections show a plateauing of cases under assumptions of no significant behaviour change apart from as a result of school holidays.</p>

<p>8.	It continues to be the case that those being hospitalised are increasingly from younger adult age groups where vaccination levels are lower and infection rates are higher. As infections concentrate in younger age groups, changes which disproportionately affect the contact patters of these age groups (e.g., schools closing or nightclubs opening) will have a significant effect on the trajectory of the epidemic.</p>

<p>9.	Delta remains the dominant variant in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and there are currently no signs of growth of other variants. <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data show an increase in the proportion of those infected self-reporting symptoms since mid-May when the delta variant became dominant. The symptoms reported are consistent with those which were reported when alpha was dominant. There are some differences in symptoms reported between adults and children.</p>

<p>10.	Other respiratory viruses will also have increased in prevalence as mixing has increased, some of which may lead to symptoms similar to <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr>. This increase in prevalence is likely to continue, and evaluation of multiplex testing is underway at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>/<abbr>UKHSA</abbr>. Multiplex testing has several benefits including enabling
better surveillance, faster treatment decisions, and more targeted isolation.</p>

<p>11.	People who have been vaccinated in regulated clinical trials should now be able to obtain equivalent certification in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> to those who have been vaccinated with approved vaccines. Work is continuing to enable those people to have equivalent recognition of their vaccination status in other countries. Volunteersâ participation in vaccine trials is an essential part of the development and approval of vaccines and it is important not to disincentivise participation.</p>

<p>12.	<abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> welcomed the publication of a report by the Academy of Medical Sciences on preparing for winter 2021-22, and a report from the Royal Academy of Engineering on infection resilient environments. Both of these reports have recommendations that should be considered by a number of government departments.</p>

<h2>Issues to monitor over the coming months</h2>

<p>13.	<abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> has previously advised on the risks associated with high prevalence (e.g. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> 93). The risks highlighted remain relevant including hospitalisations and deaths; long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>; workforce absences (including in the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>); and the increased risk of new variants emerging, as well as the increased pressure put on
testing capacity.</p>

<p>14.	In the event that increasing hospitalisations were likely to put unsustainable pressure on the <abbr title="National Health Service">NHS</abbr>, this would need to be identified rapidly and contingency plans enacted within days, given the delays between infection and hospitalisation (i.e., because hospitalisations will continue rising for a time even once infections start to fall). Having clear trigger mechanisms for this in place is strongly advised.</p>

<p>15.	It will be more difficult to identify these issues rapidly if testing capacity is overwhelmed or if testing behaviours change. Sequencing capacity is also important to identify the emergence of any new variants.</p>

<p>16.	It is expected that there will be differences in levels and impact of infections between areas and different groups of people. Taking into account this heterogeneity, it will be important to continue to monitor the situation carefully. As identified in the Academy of Medical Sciences report, early autumn may be a particularly risky time if a return to pre-pandemic behaviours coincides with schools and universities reopening.</p>

<p>17.	There are unknown effects on vaccine effectiveness in a high prevalence environment where transmission pressure is high. As infections increase so will the number and strength of challenges from <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> that vaccinated individuals will face; to date, vaccine effectiveness has been estimated in the context of comparatively low prevalence. <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> cycle threshold (<abbr title="cycle threshold">Ct</abbr>) values have decreased as the delta variant has become dominant, which indicates that infected people have higher viral loads which may further increase force of infection.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SPI-M to set out its data requirements for PHE and NHSE, including the requirement for linked data on vaccination status and hospitalisations.</li>
  <li>NHSE and JBC to provide analysis of local and national NHS impacts at different levels of hospital or ICU admissions or occupancy.</li>
  <li>SAGE Secretariat to share AcMedSci and RAEng reports across government.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Human challenge studies</h2>

<p>18.	A human challenge study inoculated 27 healthy, seronegative volunteers aged 18â 30 with a variant of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> isolated in summer 2020. A low dose of the virus (10 infectious units) was administered to each volunteer, resulting in 16 of the 27 becoming infected. All infected individuals had only mild symptoms.</p>

<p>19.	Virus shedding was detected 2 days after inoculation and for some individuals was detectable in the throat before it was detectable in the nose. Virus shedding then continued for around 10 days. This is consistent with previous understanding of the duration of infectiousness and <abbr title="New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group">NERVTAG</abbr> did not identify a need to change any recommendations around isolation based on this new information.</p>

<p>20.	There was a rapid early increase in viral replication (peaking in the nose or throat at around 3 days after inoculation), which highlights the importance of early isolation and testing in preventing transmission.</p>

<p>21.	Nose shedding correlated better than throat shedding with detection of infectious virus on face masks, on surfaces and in the air. This suggests that nose shedding may be more important for transmission than throat shedding. This reinforces the importance of face coverings covering both the mouth and the nose.</p>

<p>22.	Lateral flow assays (LFAs) correlated quite well with virus culture, which supports the utility of LFAs in detecting infectious people, including detecting early infection although there were a few instances where the very first swab was infectious but missed by LFA.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Actions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>NERVTAG to update note to acknowledge the high ventilation rate in the rooms used in the study.</li>
  <li>HOCI group consider whether it needs to review advice on the use of PPE in healthcare settings.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>
</h2>

<p>23.	The prevalence of prolonged symptoms at 12 weeks post <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>
infection (long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr>) is uncertain and estimates vary by study design, ranging from 2.3% to 37% of those infected. Those reporting symptoms that limit their daily living range from 1.2% in young adults to 4.8% in middle age. Fatigue is the most commonly reported persistent symptom.</p>

<p>24.	No clear individual syndromes have yet been identified, but it appears that there are likely to be at least four distinct syndromes. There are similarities in the symptoms for those who have been hospitalised and those who have not, and it is not yet clear how syndromes or symptom clusters link to severity of initial disease.</p>

<p>25.	Rates of medium-long term multi-organ sequelae (respiratory disease, major adverse cardiovascular event, diabetes, renal failure, and liver disease) are elevated in patients hospitalised with <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> compared with matched general population and are similar to those hospitalised with pneumonia; however, estimates
of the incidence of post-infection adverse events in non-hospitalised <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> cases are lacking.</p>

<p>26.	Consistent risk factors across studies include increasing age, female sex, being overweight/obesity, pre-existing asthma, pre-pandemic poor physical and mental health, and severity of the initial illness.</p>

<p>27.	There are limited data available for children, but the data which are available suggest that long illness duration after <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection in school-aged children is uncommon, with around 2% experiencing symptoms at 8 weeks post infection (low confidence). For those children who do suffer long illness duration, there may be a need for guidance to parents, carers and schools on how to support them.</p>

<p>28.	The limited data available on the impact of vaccination suggest that prevalence of symptoms may be substantially reduced in individuals who become infected after double vaccination compared to those who are not vaccinated (low confidence).</p>

<p>29.	Data from studies which are underway should help answer some of the outstanding questions. Research into treatments will be important and these studies may also have relevance to other similar syndromes. Studies have given insight into some of the biological changes that occur with long term symptoms.
30.	Data from the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> on long <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID</abbr> are broadly consistent with international comparators.</p>

<h2>Vaccine efficacy</h2>

<p>31.	Vaccines currently in use in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> for <abbr title="coronavirus">COVID-19</abbr> are highly effective in protecting against severe disease and death. However, vaccines do not produce sterilising immunity (where infection is completely prevented).</p>

<p>32.	A range of studies are regularly reviewed to estimate the effectiveness of vaccines against infection, symptomatic disease, severe disease and transmission. For the vaccines considered so far (primarily Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca), the effectiveness against severe outcomes appears similar for the alpha and delta variants (although effectiveness against delta is probably reduced to some
extent). Other vaccines and variants will be reviewed as more data accumulate.</p>

<p>33.	For these two vaccines, protection against infection with alpha is around 80-85% from 2 doses (low confidence). Recent <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data suggest that protection against infection with delta may be lower (low confidence).</p>

<p>34.	Protection after two doses against symptomatic disease for delta is around 70% for AstraZeneca (medium confidence) and around 85% for Pfizer-BioNTech (high confidence).</p>

<p>35.	Protection against hospitalisation, for both vaccines, is c.80% after one dose and c.95% after the second dose (there is currently a higher degree of confidence for the Pfizer estimates than the AZ estimates).</p>

<p>36.	Understanding of the effectiveness of the vaccines not widely administered in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and of <abbr title="vaccine efficacy">VE</abbr> against other VOCs not currently circulating widely here will be important if there is to be a more open international travel policy.</p>

<p>37.	<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data suggest that for those who have been vaccinated who do get infected with the delta variant, <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> cycle threshold (<abbr title="cycle threshold">Ct</abbr>) values are generally lower than for those infected with alpha, suggesting that vaccinated people may still have a high viral load with delta infection (medium confidence). This may mean that there is
limited vaccine effect against on onward transmission for the delta variant.</p>

<h2>Waning of vaccine-derived immunity</h2>

<p>38.	It is not yet known how long vaccine-induced protection against <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> infection will last, but it is highly likely that it will wane over time (high confidence). It is also likely that protection against severe disease will wane, but to a lesser extent (medium confidence).</p>

<p>39.	The level of serum antibodies can act as a proxy for measuring immunity. Monitoring this at population level could help guide decisions on vaccine booster doses. Antibodies are not the only part of the immune response, and even as antibody levels decrease there is likely to remain some protection against severe disease, and any repeat infection is likely to bolster that immunity.</p>

<p>40.	There are different rates of antibody waning in different populations and for different vaccines and dosing intervals. Older people are likely to show lower antibody rates initially after vaccination and have faster waning of antibody levels. Data from <abbr title="REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2">REACT-2</abbr> and the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> have shown that after two doses of vaccine, antibody levels remain high over at least several months though <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> data show that for Pfizer there are differences in the antibody response by age.</p>

<p>41.	Older and more clinically vulnerable vaccinated people will be particularly important to monitor. Since they may experience waning of immunity earlier than
others, monitoring antibodies in a cohort of these individuals may produce an early warning signal of when waning immunity is likely to become an issue for the wider population. Identifying any increase in cases or hospitalisations in this group will also be important and is another reason why linking vaccination status and hospital data is necessary.</p>

</div>

<h2>Long-term viral evolution</h2>

<p>42.	It is almost certain that the emergence of new variants of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> is related to the amount of circulating virus, with higher rates of circulation and
transmission creating more opportunities for new variants to emerge (high
confidence).</p>

<p>43.	There are a number of possible scenarios which could lead to the emergence of a variant which is more transmissible, causes more severe disease, or has a degree of immune escape.</p>

<p>44.	A variant which causes more severe disease could emerge through recombination, where it is produced in an individual infected with two separate variants or acquire other genetic material from other viruses or the host (realistic possibility). Current vaccines are highly likely to continue to provide protection against serious disease for such new variants. However, since no vaccine is completely effective, there would likely still be an increase in morbidity and mortality from such a variant.</p>

<p>45.	An immune escape variant could emerge in several ways. This
includes through antigenic shift, where natural recombination events change the spike glycoprotein of the virus (realistic possibility). It could also emerge through animals becoming infected, the virus mutating within that population and then later this new variant infecting humans (realistic possibility). A new variant could also emerge through antigenic drift, where antigenic variation eventually leads to current vaccine failure (almost certain). These could occur over different timeframes. It is unknown how levels of immunity change the risk of the establishment of such a variant.</p>

<p>46.	Reducing transmission, increasing vaccination levels, monitoring new variants and preparing to update vaccinations would mitigate the risks of such new variants.</p>

<p>47.	A new variant could emerge that evades current antiviral strategies. Reducing the likelihood of such a variant emerging requires careful use of antivirals. This includes taking particular care in the treatment of immunocompromised people, or others infected for a long period, in whom viral evolution is more likely to happen. In particular, those working with infected immunocompromised individuals should take extra precautions to prevent onwards transmission.</p>

<p>48.	Although unlikely in the short term, in the long term it is a realistic possibility that variants will arise that are more transmissible but with reduced virulence. This reduced virulence, along with high population immunity, could eventually lead to the virus causing a much less severe disease.</p>

<p>49.	As antiviral drugs become available it will be very important to use them in a way that does not induce viral escape from their effects, for example using them in combinations.</p>

<h2>Impact of international vaccination</h2>

<p>50.	The biggest threat to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>âs health security and response to the <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> pandemic is the emergence (and establishment within the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) of variants that either have increased transmissibility, increased severity, escape prior immunity or a combination of these characteristics (high confidence). At this point in the epidemic, with a high degree of population immunity, an immune escape variant would be of particular concern (high confidence).</p>

<p>51.	Substantial global circulation of <abbr title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr> will lead to the evolution of new variants and continued risk of importation to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (medium confidence). Reducing prevalence globally will therefore reduce the risk to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. Multilateral coordination will be important in achieving this.</p>

<p>52.	Increased international vaccination (e.g., by sharing of doses or supporting increased manufacture) has the potential to reduce the appearance and establishment of variants internationally, as well as the risk of their importation to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (medium confidence). There are also strong ethical reasons for supporting international vaccination efforts. Targeting international vaccination efforts (e.g., to countries where there are higher numbers of immunocompromised people, for example due to <abbr title="human immunodeficiency virus">HIV</abbr> infection) may be particularly beneficial.</p>

<p>53.	The choice of vaccine is likely to be important and may change over time. Although using single doses would allow more people to be reached with limited supply, it may also result in more people having partial immunity which may increase the risk of an immune escape variant developing or spreading.</p>

<p>54.	Border measures may also reduce the risk to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, though these will delay rather than prevent the importation of variants. Reducing global prevalence may lessen the need for border measures. Strengthening global surveillance of variants (as well as continued surveillance in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>) will be important in understanding the risk. <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> strongly supports the need for effective surveillance systems in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> (<abbr>UKHSA</abbr>) and the presence of a global surveillance system as envisioned in the <abbr title="Group of seven">G7</abbr> communique. In addition to sequencing, studies on biology including transmission fitness and antigenicity will be required to understand which variants may become dominant.</p>
