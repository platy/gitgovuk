<h2>About the service</h2>

<p>The pre-licence priority service allows sponsors to prioritise their application for a sponsor licence, by submitting an application by email.</p>

<p>This service does not guarantee your request will be approved.</p>

<p>Please note, Global Business Mobility (GBM) UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier Worker and Secondment Worker and Scale-up Worker applications are not eligible for priority at this moment in time and will not be accepted on the priority service.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>To be eligible for this service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you must have submitted an application for a sponsor licence by completing the UKVI ‘Online sponsor application registration’. Once you have registered, you will be able to log into the UKVI ‘Sponsor Application log in’ page. You must then complete the online application form and submit specified documents to prove you are eligible and suitable. These documents are listed in Appendix A of the sponsor guidance</li>
  <li>the request must not be in progress/or allocated to a caseworker</li>
  <li>you must submit a fully completed application to the pre-licence priority service</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>Full guidance on how to apply for a sponsor licence can be found within the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/946016/2020-12-17_Sponsor-guidance_Part-1-Apply-for-licence_12-20_v1.0.pdf" rel="external">Workers and Temporary Workers Guidance for Sponsors</a>.</p>

<p>Upon acceptance of your application you will receive an email offering you the opportunity to apply for the enhanced service.</p>

<p>If you wish to take up this offer please mail: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:PreLicencePriorityService@homeoffice.gov.uk">PreLicencePriorityService@homeoffice.gov.uk</a>, with a completed priority service – email request form as an attachment.</p>

<p>The priority service is open from 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays. Any requests made outside these hours will not be considered.</p>

<p>A maximum of 30 priority service requests will be accepted each day. Please note that due to recent events (COVID-19), this is subject to change.</p>

<p>If your request has been successful, you will receive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an email from the priority service team to advise that your request has been accepted, along with further instructions</li>
  <li>a second email containing a Worldpay link - check your spam or junk folder if it does not arrive</li>
</ul>

<p>You have 72 hours (this includes weekends) from when you receive the second email to pay the appropriate fee. If we do not receive your payment within that time, your priority request will expire and you will need to apply again to be considered.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why your request may not be successful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your request is <a class="govuk-link" href="#eligibility">ineligible</a> for the service</li>
  <li>we have reached our daily allocation limit</li>
  <li>you have submitted a priority request outside the services operating times</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not receive a response, please assume that your request has not been successful.</p>

<p>Attach the electronically signed submission sheet, along with all relevant documentation, to your priority request. If you are not sure what documentation you need to provide, please check <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/946016/2020-12-17_Sponsor-guidance_Part-1-Apply-for-licence_12-20_v1.0.pdf" rel="external">Workers and Temporary Workers Guidance for Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2>Processing times</h2>

<p>Eligible requests that have successfully made payment will be considered within 10 working days.</p>

<p>The 10 working days consideration period begins the following working day from when the payment is made. For example, if you were to make a payment on Monday, the 10 working day timescale will begin on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 10 working days begins from the date that UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) receives your submission sheet and all required documentation if it has not already been received.</p>

<p>You may not receive an outcome within the 10 working days if your request is complex or extra checks are required. We will write to the authorising officer via email in this instance.</p>

<p>We may request further information within the 10 working day timescale; if we do not receive this information in due course, we may reject the request and no refund will be issued. For this reason, please ensure the Authorising Officer checks their email, including junk mail regularly.</p>

<p>If your consideration is delayed for other reasons outside of normal case working processes (for example, a technical error), you may be eligible for a refund.</p>

<p>The outcome will be sent by email to the authorising officer listed on the licence.</p>

<p>This service does not guarantee your request will be approved.</p>

<h2>Fee</h2>

<p>The fee for the service is £500 per request.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
