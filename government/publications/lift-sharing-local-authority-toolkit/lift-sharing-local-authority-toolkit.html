<p>Lift sharing, also known as car sharing, car-pooling or ride sharing is the coordinated matching up of lifts between drivers and passengers who share a common or similar route.</p>

<p>It has the potential to significantly reduce emissions from travel, particularly where large numbers of people are travelling to a single location – such as commuting to offices, business or industrial parks, or travelling to shows or festivals. This advice uses the term lift sharing to refer to all types of schemes.</p>

<h2>Types of lift sharing schemes</h2>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/future-of-mobility-urban-strategy">The Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy</a> identified a number of trends in the lift sharing space such as:</p>

<h3>Informal</h3>

<p>This is arranged directly with friends, neighbours or colleagues who share a similar route. Local authorities do not have a role in this type of lift sharing, apart from promoting this behaviour through communication campaigns, for example.</p>

<h3>Formal</h3>

<p>This is arranged and managed through an app or website, which automatically matches users’ journeys. Some lift sharing platforms charge a fee for bringing drivers and sharers together. Users may or may not know each other. Local authorities can play an organisational or coordinating role in formal lift sharing schemes.</p>

<p>A formal arrangement can be:</p>

<h4>Open</h4>

<p>This is available to the public to register and offer lifts through a platform that connects drivers with passengers. Users are often moderated by the organiser for additional safety and security, and it is possible to match with strangers.</p>

<p>Authorities can set up branded lift sharing schemes for their area that are open to residents, businesses and staff.</p>

<h4>Closed</h4>

<p>This is set up for a particular employer, area, or group, such as an industrial estate or business park. Only members of the group or staff of the organisation can join and connect with others to share lifts. Authorities can set up a closed lift sharing group only for staff use and can promote their use to local businesses.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://como.org.uk/shared-mobility/shared-rides-and-the-rest/what-2/" rel="external">CoMoUK</a> explains more about lift sharing, and identifies some UK-based formal lift sharing providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.blablacar.co.uk/" rel="external">BlaBlaCar</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://gocarshare.com/" rel="external">GoCarShare</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://jbgb.com/" rel="external">Jambusters</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://liftshare.com/uk" rel="external">Liftshare</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://skootride.com/" rel="external">Scoot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Lift sharing is not the same as ride pooling (also known as ride-hailing), which is not covered here. Ride pooling is a service by which users can book a commercially operated car (such as a taxi), generally through an app, which they are prepared to share with an unknown third party.</p>

<h2>The benefits of lift sharing</h2>

<p>Lift sharing increases vehicle occupancy and reduces overall journeys made, particularly at peak times. This reduces carbon emissions from vehicles.</p>

<p>Additional benefits include reducing air pollution, congestion (and engine idling) and space required for car parking.</p>

<p>The Midlands Connect <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.midlandsconnect.uk/publications/the-future-of-rural-mobility/" rel="external">rural mobility toolkit in their 2022 report on the future of mobility</a> gives examples of the benefits of lift sharing alongside other low carbon transport models, with a particular focus on effective interventions in rural areas.</p>

<h3>Carbon savings from lift sharing</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-decarbonisation-plan">Transport decarbonisation plan</a> committed to taking action to increase average road vehicle occupancy by 2030.</p>

<p>Increasing car occupancy from current levels of 1.55 people to 1.7 could save nearly 3 million tonnes (<abbr title="million tonnes">Mt</abbr>) of carbon dioxide (<abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr>) emissions per year by 2030 – roughly equivalent to that currently emitted from all UK buses in a year.</p>

<p>Research by Liftshare suggests that each 1% increase in vehicle occupancy saves 2.5 billion car miles and 0.75MtCO2.</p>

<p>Based on 2011 census data, Liftshare suggest that increasing vehicle occupancy by 1% annually between 2022 and 2030 would remove 1.25 million cars from the road and result in an annual reduction in <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> of 1.25Mt.</p>

<p>Research by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://blog.blablacar.com/newsroom/news-list/zeroemptyseats" rel="external">BlaBlaCar &amp; Le Bipe</a> across 8 European countries suggests that through lift sharing, the number of people travelling increased from 1.9 to 3.9 people per car on average and delivered direct <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> savings of 0.9MtCO2, a 26% emissions reduction.</p>

<p>When indirect emissions savings from informal arrangements outside of its platforms were included, savings increased to an estimated 1.6MtCO2 in 2018.</p>

<h3>Wider benefits of lift sharing</h3>

<p>In addition to decarbonisation, lift sharing can deliver significant wider benefits for local authorities, organisations and service users by reducing congestion.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/shared-mobility-user-attitudes">2019 shared mobility report</a> and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-and-transport-technology-public-attitudes-tracker">2019 public attitudes tracker</a> identify some of these wider benefits.</p>

<p>Benefits for local authority policy delivery can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contributing towards wider sustainability and environmental targets</li>
  <li>reducing congestion at main junctions during peak hours</li>
  <li>improving air quality through fewer cars on the road and less congestion</li>
  <li>reducing parking problems in towns and at business centres</li>
  <li>supporting objectives to increase accessibility to important services by resident population (such as improving opportunities to access employment outside public transport operating hours)</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits for organisations can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>saving money through reducing the need for parking spaces</li>
  <li>improving corporate image and demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility</li>
  <li>contributing towards environmental accreditation standards, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/iso-14001-environmental-management.html" rel="external"><abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> 14001</a>
</li>
  <li>supporting recruitment and retention</li>
  <li>creating better internal social networks, creating stronger social bonds between employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits for users can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reducing travel costs – in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics">National Travel Survey</a>, 67% of respondents stated that lift sharing would be cheaper than travelling alone, while drivers can be recompensed any expenditure from the journey, they cannot make a profit</li>
  <li>improving accessibility of public (and other) transport modes to enable door-to-door travel</li>
  <li>flexible arrangements that suit all parties and sharing only with people they know</li>
  <li>freeing up household cars for other family members</li>
  <li>reducing travel and parking time, particularly if priority parking is provided and freeing up parking spaces for those unable to lift share</li>
  <li>greater freedom for those unable to access or own a private vehicle</li>
  <li>social benefits of sharing the journey</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scheme evaluation</h3>

<p>A 2020 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620319168" rel="external">lift sharing study</a> assessed lifetime emissions and the impact of lift sharing in the Netherlands, US and Canada on emissions from other transport modes, including emissions from the full life cycle of public transport and shared cars.</p>

<p>It accounted for the rebound effects of modal shift from alternative modes (such as moving from public transport) to driving.</p>

<p>The study found that even when considering lifecycle emissions, lift sharing has a net positive effect on reducing <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions from transport, although this is lower than other studies have indicated.</p>

<p>Behaviour change (away from driving) had the most significant positive effect. Increasing vehicle occupancy was found to have the greatest effect on reducing <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO2</abbr> emissions.</p>

<h2>Actions for local authorities</h2>

<p>While much lift sharing is informal or through closed schemes for particular employers, local authorities can demonstrate leadership by setting up and promoting lift sharing schemes for staff, residents and businesses.</p>

<p>Local authority involvement can add value to lift sharing schemes by providing expert advice and ensuring that the solution meets local needs. By bringing stakeholders, such as businesses and public sector employers together, authorities can provide or increase economies of scale.</p>

<p>There are 3 broad options for setting up a lift sharing scheme. Local authorities can set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a closed scheme for local authority staff</li>
  <li>closed schemes for local businesses, business parks or industrial estates</li>
  <li>a community scheme with closed or open groups for different employers or groups, one of which may be council staff</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing lift sharing across a wider area</h4>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://liftshare.com/uk/community/devon" rel="external">Carshare Devon</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://liftshare.com/uk/community/carsharewarwickshire" rel="external">Carshare Warwickshire</a> are collections of local lift sharing schemes operated by the councils, NHS Foundation Trusts and various businesses across the areas they serve.</p>

<p>They both operate an open lift sharing platform for residents in the county to use, as well as to organisation-specific closed groups.</p>
</div>

<p>Actions for all approaches are similar. Where there are some differences, these are set out below. Businesses may also choose to set up their own lift sharing schemes without local authority involvement. In these cases, the role of the authority is to support and promote where appropriate.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing lift sharing at university</h4>

<p>Three universities with campuses in Canterbury have come together to form Unishare South East. Users of any university can register to the portal to share lifts with others. Each university has its own portal, and the University of Kent has produced guidance for scheme users to help them understand how to benefit.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Undertake feasibility assessments</h2>

<p>A feasibility assessment is likely to be required regardless of whether an authority is considering a lift sharing scheme for its staff, the community or both.</p>

<p>The assessments should gather new data to assess how lift sharing will change in car occupancy and deliver benefits carbon emissions, congestion, access to services, social exclusion and cost of living for their target audience.</p>

<h3>Data on vehicle occupancy</h3>

<p>Developing an understanding of target audience and their current travel patterns will help ensure the lift sharing scheme is tailored appropriately, resulting in a greater chance of long term success. It will also provide valuable baseline data from which to monitor progress towards targets.</p>

<p>Information to assess that feasibility that is common to all target audiences includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/nts09-vehicle-mileage-and-occupancy">historic car occupancy</a> levels, available as part of the national travel survey, which will help to identify how vehicle occupancy varies across an area</li>
  <li>current car occupancy levels in the area at different times of day</li>
  <li>the current carbon impact of commuting in the local authority area (Mobilityways has produced a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mobilityways.com/estimator/" rel="external">calculator</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mobilityways.com/map/" rel="external">map</a> that can help identify these impacts on a local scale)</li>
</ul>

<p>Information gathered through feasibility assessments will help an authority to set targets and establish a monitoring programme for a lift sharing scheme.</p>

<h3>For a staff lift sharing scheme</h3>

<p>Data on how people currently travel to and from work will help support scheme design.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any informal lift sharing</li>
  <li>attitudes towards lift sharing and other sustainable travel options</li>
  <li>incentives and supporting measures that staff feel would encourage them to lift share</li>
</ul>

<p>This information can be gathered either through travel surveys or focus groups.</p>

<p>Oxfordshire County Council has produced <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/residents/roads-and-transport/transport-policies-and-plans/transport-new-developments/travel-plans-and-statements" rel="external">guidance on travel plan monitoring</a>, including an example travel plan survey.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Encouraging lift sharing: Eastleigh Borough Council</h4>

<p>As part of an office move, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://business.liftshare.com/case-studies/eastleigh-borough-council/" rel="external">the council wanted to focus on sustainable transport and commuting options</a>. All staff who completed the annual travel survey were offered a personalised travel plan to the new office.</p>

<p>After the travel plans had been delivered, follow-up surveys were conducted with staff. Results showed that single occupant vehicle use had decreased by 32%, while cycling and train use had increased significantly. Travel plans are now offered to all new starters as part of their induction.</p>
</div>

<h3>For a community lift sharing scheme</h3>

<p>Similar information to staff schemes will be required to assess the feasibility of a community lift sharing scheme.</p>

<p>Local authorities could look to incorporate location data on business parks and from large employers in addition to that from residents.</p>

<p>It would also be useful to gather some data on any informal lift sharing taking place across the authority, as well as any closed schemes already operating within business parks or large employers, as this may affect engagement with any new community schemes.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>There is not currently any funding available from government to support community lift sharing schemes. If the lift sharing scheme will be linked to a new development, an authority may use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/planning-obligations#what-are-planning-obligations">Section 106 funding</a> to deliver a community lift sharing scheme to support parking restrictions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Establish a strategy</h2>

<p>An action for local authorities to take is to establish a strategy for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.creds.ac.uk/publications/where-now-where-next/" rel="external">increasing vehicle occupancy and developing shared mobility</a> in their area.</p>

<p>This could be a standalone strategy or be included within other travel plans and strategies.</p>

<p>Incorporating shared mobility with other transport strategies will make sure a holistic approach to transport decarbonisation is taken and avoid conflict with other strategic priorities.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Develop a business case</h2>

<p>The findings from the feasibility assessments, combined with the benefits of lift sharing, will inform the development of the business case for implementing a lift sharing scheme.</p>

<p>The greatest identifiable benefits to include in a business case are often:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the carbon emissions savings from the commute and business travel</li>
  <li>cost savings associated with car parking, freeing up space from reduced parking demand</li>
  <li>improved efficiency of operation (such as support to recruitment and retention issues)</li>
</ul>

<p>In September 2021, the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>) published an article on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/covid19restrictionscuthouseholdemissions/2021-09-21" rel="external">impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions on household emissions</a>.</p>

<p>The article includes several calculators to visualise the impact of changes in working behaviours, including commuting and lift sharing. The calculators are designed for individuals but may provide indicative emissions savings to support a business case.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Set up or procure a lift sharing service</h2>

<p>The primary consideration for any lift sharing scheme is how to match potential sharers. Other considerations include that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the approach should be appropriate for the scale of the scheme being considered, and an internal scheme may require a less formal approach than an open community scheme</li>
  <li>software needs to be sufficiently reliable to build confidence in the scheme and authorities may wish to include a target for this in procurement documents</li>
  <li>all closed internal schemes systems will require administrative and promotional support from local authority officers, as will some open schemes</li>
  <li>use of a map as part of the matching service increases effectiveness, allowing users to see common origins, arrange on-route pickups and link with other sustainable transport options</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome of the feasibility assessments and development of the business case will identify the type of scheme an authority is aiming to provide.</p>

<p>Less formal approaches where participants self-match or are matched by a coordinator may be better suited to smaller, closed schemes. A more formal approach is likely to be appropriate for larger schemes as participant matches are performed by the software.</p>

<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of some common approaches</h3>

<h4>Informal register to enable participants to self-match</h4>

<p>The advantages of an informal register are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are simple and low cost to set up</li>
  <li>they are a good option for small closed group schemes</li>
  <li>participants can self-match allowing staff to choose lift sharing partners</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>monitoring performance and effectiveness can be difficult</li>
  <li>if successful, it may take considerable time to administer</li>
  <li>they can lack credibility</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spreadsheet or database</h4>

<p>The advantages of a spreadsheet or database are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are simple and low cost to set up</li>
  <li>they are a good option for closed group lift sharing schemes</li>
  <li>results can be positive for modal shift and increasing occupancy</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can be staff time intensive</li>
  <li>require a coordinator to manage and match participants</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bespoke software developed using in-house IT support</h4>

<p>The advantages of using bespoke software are that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is tailor-made solution for an organisation or site</li>
  <li>can include monitoring and performance management</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is not easily integrated into other lift sharing networks</li>
  <li>requires an appropriately skilled and resourced IT department</li>
</ul>

<h4>Open or closed group on a commercial site</h4>

<p>The advantages of an open or closed group on a commercial site are that this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is a quick and cost effective way to start lift sharing</li>
  <li>provides reliable technology</li>
  <li>is easy to integrate with operators’ wider networks</li>
  <li>will potentially bring more schemes or groups in an area together under one brand</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sites can be branded but may not be tailored to the needs of the group</li>
  <li>it may be more expensive than other options</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Engagement and promotion</h2>

<p>Marketing and promotion are fundamental to the success of lift sharing and are generally undertaken by the coordinator and champions.</p>

<h3>Scheme coordinators and champions</h3>

<p>A manager or scheme coordinator is required to ensure the smooth running of the scheme. They are responsible for the day-to-day management, including responding to questions and requests from users, promotion, gathering and assessing data and monitoring the scheme.</p>

<p>This role can form part of an existing role in a local authority, such as a sustainability or climate change officer, or may be held by parking or facilities managers.</p>

<p>Scheme champions are public advocates of the scheme to peers and committed to making it a success. Ideally, champions will be well known individuals, such as senior managers, elected members, or local business leaders. 
They provide a public face for the scheme, promoting it to the media and to the groups they represent.</p>

<h3>Incentives</h3>

<p>Offering incentives is an effective way of increasing membership and helping to overcome objections. The most effective incentives will vary by location and by scheme type, but offering dedicated parking bays and guaranteeing a ride home are often the most successful.</p>

<p>Travel survey responses may also provide ideas.</p>

<h3>Dedicated parking bays</h3>

<p>Dedicated parking spaces in staff or public car parks for lift sharers can play a large part in influencing people to join.</p>

<p>This can be particularly effective if the spaces designated are seen as more desirable – positioned closer to building entrances or shops.</p>

<p>An authority may need to make changes to traffic regulation orders (TROs) or staff parking policy to support dedicating ‘lift sharing only’ bays in its car parks.</p>

<h4>Implementing lift sharing: Ocado</h4>

<p>Ocado set up an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://business.liftshare.com/case-studies/ocado/" rel="external">internal lift sharing scheme</a> for its fulfilment centre staff. It is accessible through a dual carriageway, limiting some sustainable transport options.</p>

<p>The scheme is also used to attract and retain staff. New starters are given time to sign up and find matches and the company offers incentives such as free breakfasts, parking spaces and competitions to encourage sign up.</p>

<p>Liftshare estimates the scheme has saved 1,726 tonnes of CO2, 7.8 million miles and £1.9 million in costs for members.</p>
</div>

<h3>For community or open schemes</h3>

<p>Marked reserved bays add credibility and send a clear message to potential users that the scheme is supported by the landowner.</p>

<p>Spaces need to be clearly signed, potentially using different colours and display a lift sharing logo. Any dedicated spaces will need enforcing to ensure that they are only used by lift sharers.</p>

<p>There are many different approaches to enforcement of these spaces and one option is to issue lift sharing permits.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>Implementing lift sharing: Get Around Milton Keynes</h4>

<p>Around 60% of residents in Milton Keynes also work there. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://getaroundmk.org.uk/get-connected/sharing" rel="external">Get Around Milton Keynes</a> has implemented an open lift sharing scheme for residents who drive to work to help reduce congestion and parking pressure in central areas.</p>

<p>The lift sharing scheme is supported by a lift sharing parking scheme so that users can access parking spaces in prime locations.</p>

<p>The annual permit costs £130 per person. This gives access to free parking in many spaces as well as access to over 350 ‘car share only’ bays.</p>
</div>

<h3>For staff or closed schemes</h3>

<p>Another approach to designating bays for lift sharers in staff car parks is to designate part of a car park for lift sharers and monitor entry. This approach has the added benefit of recording the daily number of lift sharers and providing data for incentives.</p>

<h3>Guaranteeing a ride home</h3>

<p>This incentive works well for closed, employer specific schemes or groups within a wider scheme, but is impractical to manage for open schemes.</p>

<p>A guaranteed ride home is a supporting scheme that ensures lift sharing passengers can get home if their usual driver needs to change their routine. This may be a lift from a fellow employee, a paid taxi, or a bus or train fare. This is an important factor in the success of most closed lift sharing schemes as it provides reassurance for members.</p>

<h3>Additional considerations for community or open schemes</h3>

<p>Allowing local businesses and the community to access a local authority endorsed lift sharing scheme, will have a greater impact on vehicle occupancy, congestion, carbon emissions and air quality, rather than offering a closed scheme for staff alone.</p>

<p>These schemes may benefit from additional promotion to maximise uptake from the community. Authorities may want to consider the use of variable road signs and public advertising space, as well as promotion through newsletters, social media and pages on the local authority website.</p>

<p>Authorities will need to engage with local employers to promote the benefits of lift sharing and to their staff to encourage sign-up.</p>

<p>One approach is to promote travel planning or offer to develop travel plans to highlight the sustainable travel options available to businesses, including lift sharing.</p>

<p>For schemes open to residents, lift sharing can be promoted as allowing those who cannot drive to access vital services with alternative options in addition to public transport or taxi services.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Lifts are often shared between people who know each other and users may have security concerns around sharing a lift with someone they do not know well.</p>

<p>An effective method of risk mitigation is to allow users to exchange messages in advance or arrange events where potential sharers can meet up before sharing.</p>

<p>Schemes should also consider security advice, which could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>users showing each other valid ID, for example, a driving licence or passport</li>
  <li>supporting initial meetings in public places</li>
</ul>

<p>If a local authority is considering working with a commercial supplier, it may have resources to address security concerns and can work with potential users to overcome these.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Monitoring and reporting</h2>

<p>To justify the cost of administering a lift sharing scheme, performance will need to be monitored to see how many people are continuing to share. Some information, such as membership numbers, may be available from the service provider to assist with monitoring usage and achieving targets.</p>

<p>This could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraging sharers to register shared journeys on a regular (daily or weekly) basis</li>
  <li>undertaking an annual travel survey that records how users currently travel and whether their behaviour has changed during the past year</li>
  <li>an occupancy count at the car park entrance (number of people per car and the number of cars) to calculate an occupancy rate</li>
  <li>a count of vehicles parked in dedicated bays</li>
  <li>using car park barriers and swipe cards if a parking area is set aside for sharers</li>
</ul>

<p>Liftshare recommends a 1% increase per year as a minimum target. Local authorities may also want to consider a target on establishing and increasing scheme usage, either as a proportion of all those who (travel planning indicates) could use the scheme or as a percentage of all staff.</p>

<p>Authorities may also want to monitor and set targets on its reduction in emissions from commuting or business travel from the use of lift sharing schemes.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Planning and new developments</h2>

<p>Lift sharing can play a role in transport planning for new developments, which local planning authorities can support in several ways.</p>

<p>Through <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/planning-obligations">Section 106 agreements</a>, authorities can secure funding for sustainable transport from developers. This can be used to set up and promote lift sharing to support new development and reduce the need for car parking.</p>

<p>Transport for London (<abbr title="Transport for London">TfL</abbr>) suggests that authorities could implement parking standards for new developments, alongside requiring travel plans to be submitted as part of the planning process to identify modal split targets.</p>

<p>New developments should look to take advantage of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://climateoutreach.org/reports/unep-communicating-lifestyle-change/" rel="external">moment for change provided by moving house</a> to promote <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.creds.ac.uk/publications/where-now-where-next/" rel="external">sustainable and active travel options</a> to encourage modal shift with residents.</p>

<p>This may include measures such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>incorporating mobility hubs</li>
  <li>creating a safe and secure walking environment</li>
  <li>cycle parking</li>
  <li>cycle lanes</li>
  <li>car club provision alongside setting up a lift sharing scheme</li>
</ul>
