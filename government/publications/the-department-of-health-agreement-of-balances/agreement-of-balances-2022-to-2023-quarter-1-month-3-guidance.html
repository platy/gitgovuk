<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The agreement of balances (<abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr>) exercise is key in ensuring that the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) group accounts are not materially misstated. Additionally, it is also important in demonstrating good financial management across the organisations which make up the group and should not be undertaken in isolation from the day-to-day accounts.</p>

<p>All <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies usually participate in an agreement of balances (<abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr>) exercise 3 times a year, at quarter 2, quarter 3 and quarter 4, in part to ensure accurate eliminations of intragroup transactions within the Consolidated Departmental Account.</p>

<p>The Health and Care Act 2022 received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022 and will see a number of changes made to certain <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies from as early as July 2022. As a result of this act, integrated care boards (ICBs) will be established and clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) and London Shared Services (previously North East London CSU NELCSU) will be abolished,&nbsp;as they are absorbed into their local ICBs on 1 July 2022. &nbsp;Also, the functions of Monitor and NHS Trust Development Authority (<abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr>) will transfer to NHS England, with Monitor and NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> abolished on 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>As a result of these 2022 to 2023 group changes we will be running a limited <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> exercise at quarter 1 for all transactions and balances with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NEL CSU), NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> and Monitor</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> exercise at quarter 1 2022 to 2023 will cover receivables, payables and accruals as at 30 June 2022 and income and expenditure for the 3 months ending 30 June 2022.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> exercise at quarter 1 is limited to transactions and balances with bodies ceasing to exist on 1 July 2022.</p>

<p>Non-NHSE group bodies are required to send statements (receivables, income and accruals) and perform agreements with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NEL CSU), Monitor and NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> only. <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NEL CSU), Monitor and NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> will send statements to and perform agreements with all non-NHSE group bodies.</p>

<p>NHS England will gain assurance on all intra-NHS England group balances through their internal mismatch process, which will run during the month 3 closedown.</p>

<p>Agreement is not required with other group bodies at quarter 1. Where an organisation does not have any transactions or balances with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NEL CSU), NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> or Monitor, a nil <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> submission will still be required for completeness.</p>

<p>A list of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> group bodies, and whether they fall in or out of scope for the purpose of this exercise, can be found at Annex A.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h2>Guidance</h2>

<p>The agreement of balances 2022 to 2023 quarter 1 (month 3) guidance below provides information specific to this additional limited AoB exercise. The principles for AoB remain unchanged and for further practical guidance on AoB and detailed instructions on how to complete the exercise, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-department-of-health-agreement-of-balances">2021 to 2022 Agreement of balances guidance</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Thresholds</h2>

<p>The agreement of receivables and payables and income and expenditure is mandatory at month 3. There is also a requirement for group bodies to issue accrual statements. Although agreement is not mandatory for accrual balances for the month 3 exercise, it is best practice, and we encourage discussions and agreement where possible.</p>

<p>Group bodies should ensure that their accrual balances (as shown on their ledger) are included in the âAccruedâ column on their collection forms.</p>

<p>The thresholds for 2022 to 2023 month 3 agreements have been set as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£300,000 for receivables and payables</li>
  <li>Â£500,000 for income and expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>The thresholds for issuing statements for 2022 to 2023 month 3 have been set as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Â£2,500 for receivables and payables</li>
  <li>Â£10,000 for income and expenditure</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> contact lists</h2>

<p>Contact lists have been refreshed for 2022 to 2023 quarter 1 (month 3) and will be circulated by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> via the national bodies in the week commencing 13th June 2022. All organisationsâ contact details were reviewed and updated in May/June 2022 via <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and national bodies.</p>

<p>Where not already the case, can organisations please make arrangements to ensure that for future periods generic email addresses are set up, as these are less likely to require amendment. If an email containing your statement is returned as undeliverable, please inform your national body in order that the issue can be resolved or escalated for this and future exercises.</p>

<h2>Additional guidance for quarter 1</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Leasing transactions (IFRS16)</h3>

<p>Following the implementation of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2022, transactions relating to leases will be reflected differently in the accounts of lessees and lessors.</p>

<p>Income and receivables statements should include all invoices, including those relating to lease transactions. Where possible, group bodies are requested to denote which balances and transactions are lease-related on their statements. This would also include any balances and transactions which contain lease-related items but are not wholly lease-related. We appreciate this may not be possible for all bodies.</p>

<p>The amounts recorded as ânotifiedâ in collection forms should relate to the full statement value, including invoices for leasing transactions. The ânotifiedâ amount should therefore agree between bodies.</p>

<p>The âadjustmentsâ column should then be used for differences between the statement (or ânotifiedâ) value and income/expenditure or payables/receivables recognised in accounts due to lease accounting treatment. For example, for a lessee, repayments of the lease liability will not be included in expenditure so will be recorded as a negative in the expenditure âadjustmentâ column. This will generate mismatches at the âtotalâ level and local bodies should ensure they understand how much of that mismatch relates to lease accounting treatment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and the national bodies are currently discussing how to address the impact of leases on the agreement of balances exercise ahead of the first full consolidation at month 9. This process may therefore change in future exercises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Donation of equipment and inventories in response to COVID-19</h3>

<p>Please note that transactions relating to items donated to group bodies as part of the COVID-19 response will continue to be excluded from the <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> process for 2022 to 2023 quarter 1, as was the case in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> Submission of <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> data</h3>

<p>The scope of this <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> exercise is limited to transactions and balances with <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NELCSU), Monitor and NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> for quarter 1 2022 to 2023. There will be 2 submissions of <abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr> data in July 2022 and only transactions and balances with these bodies need recording. All group bodies will be required to provide a submission, and nil returns are expected where there are no transactions and balances with these bodies.</p>
