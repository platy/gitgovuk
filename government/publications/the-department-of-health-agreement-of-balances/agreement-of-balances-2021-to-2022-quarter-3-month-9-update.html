<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Agreement of Balances (<abbr title="Agreement of Balances">AoB</abbr>) exercise is key in ensuring that the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) group accounts are not materially misstated.  Additionally, it is also important in demonstrating good financial management across the organisations which make up the group and should not be undertaken in isolation from the day to day accounts.</p>

<p>This document should be read in conjunction with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-department-of-health-agreement-of-balances">Agreement of Balances guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Quarter 2 and 3 (month 6 and month 9) 2021 to 2022 exercise</h3>

<p>The Department would like to say thank you for everyone’s participation in these exercises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Quarter 4 (month 12) 2021 to 2022 exercise</h3>

<p>Group bodies are reminded that the agreement of receivables and payables and income and expenditure is mandatory at month 12. Group bodies are also required to issue accrual statements. Although agreement is not mandatory for accrual balances for the month 12 exercise, it is best practice and we encourage discussions and agreement where possible.</p>

<p>Group bodies should ensure that their accrual balances (as shown on their ledger) are included in the “accrued” column on their collection forms.</p>

<p>The thresholds for 2021-22 M12 agreements have been set as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£300,000 for receivables and payables</li>
  <li>3 million for income and expenditure</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no change to the thresholds for issuing statements.</p>

<p>Where there are significant mismatches between organisations, we expect bodies to work together to reach agreements and make adjustments where appropriate. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHSE/I will be closely monitoring the mismatches at month 12 and will follow up significant differences with the relevant organisations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and Public Health England (PHE)</h3>

<p>UKHSA was formed on 1 April 2021 as an Executive Agency of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and became operational on 1 October 2021. At this point, PHE transferred its health protection functions into UKHSA and other functions into the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (<abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr>), NHS England and Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>) and NHS Digital (“receiving organisations”).</p>

<p>As such, UKHSA will be taking part in the <abbr title="Agreement of Balances">AoB</abbr> exercise from 2021 to 2022 month 9 for transactions after 1 October 2021.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Agreement of Balances">AoB</abbr> quarter 4 (month 12) 2021 to 2022 update</h4>

<p>There will be no further receivables and payables agreement for PHE as any outstanding balances were transferred to the receiving organisations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any payable balances to PHE as at 30 September 2021 remaining outstanding at month 12 should be recorded against the appropriate successor organisation – the agreement of these balances will be managed by UKHSA and all statements and correspondence will be with UKHSA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>any receivable balances from PHE as at 30 September 2021 remaining outstanding at month 12 should be recorded against the appropriate successor organisation, and agreed directly with them – receivable organisations would have been informed who the relevant successor organisation is, if you have not been informed please contact UKHSA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>income and expenditure will need to be agreed for PHE for the six months ended 30 September 2021 and should be recorded against PHE – the agreement of these transactions will be managed by UKHSA and all statements and correspondence will be with UKHSA</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for PHE transfers into and ongoing transactions with NHS England, the majority will sit with CBA033, and minority with some regions – receivable organisations must ensure they send statements to the correct NHS England sub-entity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The consolidation schedules will be updated to reflect this.</p>

<p>Please note that <abbr title="Office for Health Improvement and Disparities">OHID</abbr> is part of the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, and there is no separate agreement process needed for this organisation. Also, as part of the above reorganisation the Test &amp; Trace activities transitioned from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> to UKHSA on 1st October 2021 and as such the agreement of any Test &amp; Trace balances and transactions from this date will be with UKHSA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Donation of equipment and inventories in response to COVID-19</h3>

<p>Please note that transactions relating to items donated to group bodies as part of the Covid-19 response will continue to be excluded from the <abbr title="Agreement of Balances">AoB</abbr> process for 2021/22, as was the case in 2020 to 2021.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> <abbr title="Agreement of Balances">AoB</abbr> contact lists</h3>

<p>Contact lists have been refreshed for 2021 2022 Quarter 4 (month 12) and will be circulated by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> via the national bodies in the week commencing 14 March 2022. All organisations’ contact details were reviewed and updated in February 2022 via <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and national bodies.</p>

<p>Where not already the case, can organisations please make arrangements to ensure that for future periods, generic email addresses are set up, as these are less likely to require amendment. If an email containing your statement is returned as undeliverable, please inform your National Body in order that the issue can be resolved or escalated for this and future exercises.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> <abbr title="NHS North East London Commissioning Support Unit">NHS NEL CSU</abbr> (0DJ)</h3>

<p>On 1 November 2021 NEL CSU was renamed London Shared Services (previously <abbr title="NHS North East London Commissioning Support Unit">NHS NEL CSU</abbr>) and non-London services have transferred to North of England CSU (0AR).  London services continue to be transacted on the 0DJ ledger until 31 March 2022.  Organisations which previously transacted with NEL CSU are reminded they should ensure statements are sent to the correct CSU.</p>
