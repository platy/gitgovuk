<h2>The NHS receivables and payables, and income and expenditure reconciliation</h2>

<p>Organisations should note the following definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>receivable organisation: the organisation sending the invoice, carrying the trade receivable or receiving the income (that is, the supplier or provider)</li>
  <li>payable organisation: the organisation receiving the invoice, carrying the trade payable or recording expenditure (that is, the purchaser or commissioner)</li>
</ul>

<p>The agreement of balances (<abbr title="agreement of balances">AoB</abbr>) exercise at month 3 is a limited exercise. Only <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, London Shared Services (NEL CSU), NHS <abbr title="Trust Development Authority">TDA</abbr> and Monitor will be formally agreeing balances with organisations outside of the NHS England Group (for example, NHS trusts, NHS foundation trusts and other <abbr title="arms length bodies">ALBs</abbr>). All intra-NHS England Group balances will be monitored through the internal mismatch process. For more detail, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-department-of-health-agreement-of-balances">Agreement of balances 2022 to 2023: quarter 1 (month 3) guidance</a>.</p>
