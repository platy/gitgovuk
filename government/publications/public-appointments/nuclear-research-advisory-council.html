<p>The Nuclear Research Advisory Council is a Non-Departmental Public Body (<abbr title="Non-Departmental Public Body">NDPB</abbr>) that reviews the UK’s nuclear warhead research and capability maintenance programme, including the requirement for above ground experiments and other facilities and techniques necessary to design, manufacture, sustain and operate a UK nuclear weapon capability in the absence of underground testing. It also examines the UK’s programme of international collaboration. The Council reports to the department through the Director General Nuclear Warhead Director and continuous at sea deterrent (pending current changes to the continuous at sea deterrent role) to advise on whether the nuclear warhead programme is fit for purpose and being implemented appropriately. The council is sponsored by Director General Nuclear through the <abbr title="Non-Departmental Public Body">NDPB</abbr> budget and is operated through the Secretariat who provides the departmental interface. Members typically work up to approximately 15 days each per year, depending upon the council’s work programme and within the constraints of the budget.</p>

<p>These appointments attract a daily fee of £380, in addition to reasonable travel and subsistence expenses. The names of the Nuclear Research Advisory Council are not released to the public domain for security reasons.</p>
