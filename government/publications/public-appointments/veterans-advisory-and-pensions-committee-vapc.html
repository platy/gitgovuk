<p>The Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committees (<abbr title="Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr>) are a regional network that will help veterans and their families to access vital welfare support.</p>

<p>There are 13 regional committees across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales each one having between 12 and 20 members. They will ensure that the best possible service is provided locally. The committees have built on the role of the previous war pension committees and are made up of volunteers from a cross-section of the local community with a genuine interest in furthering the support available to veterans and their families, including health, social care, legal professionals and veterans groups.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committee">VAPC</abbr> Chairperson and members will play a central role in the recruitment of members and in promoting the interests and welfare of veterans and their families. Committee members are expected to be involved in a wide ranging agenda of issues relating to the functions of the committee.</p>

<p>The committee meets in full between 2 and 4 times a year, all committee posts are voluntary with reimbursement of travelling expenses and loss of earnings allowance payable if appropriate.</p>
