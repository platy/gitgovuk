<p>The Royal Air Force (<abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>) Museum is a world-class national museum, which is responsible for promoting the public’s understanding of the history, role and achievements of the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> through the integrated and imaginative use of its exhibitions, collections and the knowledge and expertise of its staff.</p>

<p>Capturing the often amazing achievements of its people is central to telling the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>’s story, both past and present. The arrival of a new and dynamic senior management team in 2014 to 15 was the start of a significant transformation programme aimed at ensuring that the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>’s story is told in the most comprehensive, exciting and imaginative manner. The museum already has some ground breaking exhibitions, such as the Cold War exhibition at Cosford, but the current transformation programme, which is focused on celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> in 2018, will take the museum to a new level and ensure that the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>’s story endures and enriches the lives of future generations.</p>

<p>The first phase of the ambitious £23M transformation programme was the creation of a new World War 1 in the Air Exhibition, which was opened in December 2014 and recently received the Heritage Lottery Fund Best Heritage Project Award for 2015.</p>

<p>Besides improving its exhibitions and interpretation, the Museum’s already extensive education programme will be enhanced through greater STEM learning opportunities and facilities. Although the Museum naturally reflects on the past achievements of the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr>, new emphasis will be placed on what the <abbr title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> is doing today and how its preparing for the future.</p>

<p>All appointments are voluntary but reasonable travel and subsistence expenses will be paid.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>All appointments and re-appointments have been made in accordance with the Governance Code on Public Appointments.</p>
