<h2>Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for anyone in England who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who, due to a lifelong condition, illness, disability, serious injury, a mental health condition or an addiction, cannot cope without their support. If you’re a carer in another part of the UK you should <a class="govuk-link" href="#devolved-administrations">check the information relevant to your area</a>.</p>

<p>It builds on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">other guidance published on GOV.UK</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If everyone is well and you cannot deliver care while social distancing, you can continue to provide essential care and travel to deliver this care. See information below on what to do if someone has symptoms or a positive test for coronavirus.</p>

<h2>General advice</h2>

<h3>National lockdown: stay at home</h3>

<p>You must stay at home. The single most important action we can all take is to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>

<p>You should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> immediately.</p>

<h3>Leaving home</h3>

<p>You must not leave, or be outside of your home except where necessary. You may leave the home to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>shop for basic necessities, for you or a vulnerable person</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>go to work, or provide voluntary or charitable services, if you cannot reasonably do so from home</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>exercise with your household (or support bubble) or one other person, this should be limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meet your&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">support bubble</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-childcare-bubble-with-another-household" class="govuk-link">childcare bubble</a>&nbsp;where necessary, but only if you are legally permitted to form one</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>seek medical assistance or avoid injury, illness or risk of harm (including domestic abuse)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>attend education or childcare, for those eligible</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you do leave home for a permitted reason, you should always stay local – unless it is necessary to go further, for example to go to work. Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live.</p>

<p>If you are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">clinically extremely vulnerable</a>&nbsp;you should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential. You should not attend work</p>

<h3>Protecting yourself and the person you care for</h3>

<p>If you, or the person you care for, have no symptoms then please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/">guidance on hygiene on the NHS website</a>, which says:</p>

<h4>Do:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>wash your hands with soap and water often, for at least 20 seconds</li>
  <li>use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available</li>
  <li>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze</li>
  <li>put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards</li>
  <li>clean objects and surfaces you touch often (such as door handles, kettles and phones) using your regular cleaning products</li>
  <li>consider wearing a face covering when in shared spaces</li>
  <li>keep windows open in the room you’re staying in and shared spaces as much as possible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do not:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>do not share towels, including hand towels and tea towels</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see specific situations below for what to do if you or the person you care for display symptoms.</p>

<h3>Flu vaccine</h3>
<p>If you’re the main carer you’re eligible for the flu vaccine. You can have the NHS flu vaccine at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your GP surgery</li>
  <li>a pharmacy offering the service</li>
  <li>your midwifery service if you’re pregnant</li>
</ul>

<p>See more <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/flu-influenza-vaccine/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">information on the flu vaccine on the NHS website</a>.</p>

<h3>What you should be doing to prepare</h3>
<p>We advise all carers to create an emergency plan with the person they care for, to use in circumstances where help from other people to deliver care may be needed. Depending on the circumstances, this could be help from family or friends, or a care provider.</p>

<p>To create an emergency plan that fits the needs of the person you care for, you will need to set out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the name and address and any other contact details of the person you look after</li>
  <li>who you and the person you look after would like to be contacted in an emergency</li>
  <li>details of any medication the person you look after is taking</li>
  <li>details of any ongoing treatment they need</li>
  <li>details of any medical appointments they need to keep</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also ensure that it is in a format that can readily be shared with other people who will need to discuss the plan with the person you care for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carersuk.org/search/planning-for-emergencies" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Further information can be found at Carers UK.</a></p>

<p>You may be able to arrange help and support from family and friends, but it can be reassuring to have the involvement of your local authority or <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search">healthcare provider</a> in case informal arrangements fall through. It may also be helpful to contact your local carers support organisation who can help with contingency planning. You can <a rel="external" href="https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/get-support/local-support" class="govuk-link">find out about local carer organisations at Carers UK</a>.</p>

<h3>Caring for someone who is ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance on shielding and protecting the clinically extremely vulnerable</a> people from COVID-19 has been updated. Please see this guidance for the latest advice for this group of people, which includes the definition of ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ groups and information on work, socialising and registering for support.</p>

<h3>If the person you care for is concerned about their usual paid carer coming in and out of their home and the risk of infection</h3>

<p>Care for vulnerable and disabled people can continue during the national lockdown. The government has issued&nbsp;the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-home-care/coronavirus-covid-19-provision-of-home-care">coronavirus (COVID-19): provision of home care guidance</a> to ensure that appropriate levels of hygiene are achieved to reduce the risk of infection. Speak to the care provider about the processes they are following to maintain good hygiene.</p>

<h3>Personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h3>

<p>We are currently rolling out an offer of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for COVID-19 needs to unpaid carers who do not live with the person or people they care for. This will be available until the end of June 2021, and will be available from local authorities (<abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr>) and local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>).</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers" class="govuk-link">personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>): local contacts for providers </a> for details of <abbr title="local authorities">LAs</abbr> and <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr> who are currently making <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> available to unpaid carers. You can contact them to request <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>This offer is available to cover needs for <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> that have arisen due to COVID-19. If you would normally use <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> because of the nature of the care you provide, you should continue to access it through your normal routes.</p>
</div>

<p>If you live with the person or people you care for, it is not currently recommended that you wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> unless advised to do so by a healthcare professional, like a GP or nurse.</p>

<h4>Recommended <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for unpaid carers who do not live with the person or people they care for</h4>

<p>If you do not live with the person or people you care for, it is recommended that you wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> when delivering care.</p>

<p>It is essential that <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is worn correctly in order to reduce the risk of transmission. <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be put on and removed at least 2 metres away from the person you are caring for.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures" class="govuk-link">guidance on how to put on and take off <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> correctly</a>.</p>

<p>The type of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> you should wear will depend on the type of care you provide. The type of mask you have been given will be clearly stated on the box.</p>

</ul>

<p>This guidance is the same as recommended for domiciliary care workers.</p>

<p>Disposable gloves and aprons can only be used once, and should be disposed of immediately after each caring task (for example, after you have bathed the person you care for or after you have helped the person you care for with feeding), before cleaning your hands.</p>

<p>You should not touch the mask when wearing it, other than to put it on or remove it. Your mask should be disposed of once you have removed it from your face, lowered it to your chin or if it becomes damaged, dirty, damp, or uncomfortable to use. When removed, you will need to use a new mask for your next care visit.</p>

<p>You should continue to follow advice in this guidance and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance on protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from coronavirus</a> on how to protect yourself and those you care for.</p>

<p>We are keeping this position under review.</p>

<h3>Wearing a face covering if you have to go out</h3>

<p>You must wear a face covering by law in some public places unless you have a face covering exemption because of your age, health or another condition. Check for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own#when-to-wear-a-face-covering" class="govuk-link">information on where you must wear a facemask and exemptions</a>.</p>

<p>You’re also strongly encouraged to wear a face covering in other enclosed public spaces where social distancing may be difficult and where you come into contact with people you do not normally meet.</p>

<p>It’s important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering" class="govuk-link">make face coverings at home</a>. The face covering should cover your mouth and nose.</p>

<h3>If the person you care for is in a care home</h3>

<p>If you have no symptoms, you should keep in contact with the care home to understand any local arrangement to keep in touch with residents and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus" class="govuk-link">guidance from the care home when visiting</a>.</p>

<h3>Maintaining your own health while you’re looking after others</h3>

<p>It’s important that you look after your own health and wellbeing as well as supporting others you care for, especially given the potential for additional stresses at the current time. There is general information in the guidance for the public about mental health and wellbeing about looking after your wellbeing, as well as more detailed guidance on self-care and sources of support for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19">mental health and wellbeing during the outbreak</a>. It also includes some specific advice for people who have dementia, autism, learning disabilities or additional mental health needs.</p>

<p>Tips include taking care of your mind as well as your body and getting support if you need it. Daily physical activity is important for health and wellbeing, including managing stress, and encouraging positive feelings and sleep. You can look for ideas of <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/for-your-body/move-more/home-workout-videos/" class="govuk-link">exercises you can do at home</a> from Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Draw on support you might have through your friends, family and other networks during this time. Try to stay in touch with those around you over the phone, by post, or online. Let people know how you would like to stay in touch and build that into your routine. This is also important in looking after your mental wellbeing and you may find it helpful to talk to them about how you are feeling.</p>

<p>Remember it is OK to share your concerns with others you trust and in doing so you may end up providing support to them, too. Or you can use a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mental-health-helplines/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">NHS recommended helpline</a>.</p>

<p>It may also be helpful to contact your local carers support organisation who can help with contingency planning. You can find out about local carer organisations at <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/get-support/local-support">Carers UK</a>. There is also an <a rel="external" href="https://www.carersuk.org/forum" class="govuk-link">online forum on Carers UK</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting support</h2>

<p>It’s important you consider what support you might need and how you can access support to maintain your own health and wellbeing.</p>

<h3>Support in providing breaks from care</h3>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<p>There is an exemption to allow for respite care to be provided to a vulnerable person (which includes a person with an underlying health condition) or a person with a disability. The regulations’ definition of a ‘vulnerable person’ also includes anyone who is pregnant or aged 70 or older. The regulations allow carers to access respite from family and friends where this is reasonably necessary to provide respite care for a vulnerable or disabled person or someone with an underlying health condition.</p>

<p>This means that you can arrange with family or friends for someone else to provide the care you normally provide to the person you care for, to enable you to take a break. This includes someone coming into the home of the person you care for, which can be overnight. It also means the person you care for can go to someone else’s home to receive care to give you a break from caring, which can also be overnight. In all these examples, the arrangement must be reasonably necessary for the purpose of respite care being provided for the person being cared for.</p>

<p>The number of adults in either household does not matter when making arrangements for respite care, provided the arrangements are reasonably necessary and amount to respite care provided to the person being cared for. What is suitable for you, the person you care for and the person providing the alternative care will depend on your own circumstances.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">Support bubbles</a> have been expanded.</p>

<p>You can form a support bubble with another household of any size if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you live by yourself – even if carers visit you to provide support</li>
  <li>your household includes a child who is under the age of one or was under that age on 2 December 2020</li>
  <li>your household includes a child with a disability who requires continuous care and is under the age of 5, or was under that age on 2 December 2020</li>
  <li>you’re a child under 18 years old living alone or with other children and without any adults</li>
  <li>you’re a single adult living with one or more children who are under the age of 18 or were under that age on 12 June 2020</li>
  <li>you (whether under 18 or not) are the only individual in your household who does not need continuous care as a result of a disability</li>
  <li>you (whether under 18 or not) live with one or more persons who need continuous care as a result of a disability, you do not have a disability but you also live with others who do not have disabilities, of which only one is over 18</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, an adult who provides continuous care for their spouse who needs this care as a result of a disability, can form a support bubble with their parents who live together in another property.</p>

<p>Another example is a young carer, who is under 18, who lives with their parents who both need continuous care as a result of a disability. Alternatively, the same scenario, but the young carer also lives with other siblings, only one of whom is 18. Both types of household can form a support bubble with their grandparents who live together in another property.</p>

<p>You should not form a support bubble with a household that is part of another support bubble. For further information on the other rules that apply to support bubbles, including when they end, and how to change bubbles, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/making-a-support-bubble-with-another-household">guidance on making and using a support bubble</a>.</p>

<h3>Support from volunteers</h3>
<p>You can also <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://nhsvolunteerresponders.org.uk/services">get help from NHS volunteer responders</a> who can help with things like collecting medication or shopping.</p>

<p>Call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm. There is information here about what support the NHS volunteer responders can offer.</p>

<h3>Carer’s assessment</h3>

<p>If you need support with caring, you can contact your local council for a carer’s assessment. You do not have to live with the person you care for and your entitlement to an assessment is not affected by the type or amount of care you give or your financial means. A carer’s assessment is free. It’s separate from the needs assessment the person you care for might have, but you can ask to have them both done at the same time.</p>

<p>You will be entitled to an assessment regardless of the amount or type of care you provide, your financial means or your level of need for support. You do not necessarily have to live with the person you’re looking after or be caring full-time to have an assessment.</p>

<p>If you have not been offered one, you can contact your local authority. <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-services/Local-Authority-Adult-Social-Care/LocationSearch/1918" class="govuk-link">Find your local social services team</a>.</p>

<h3>Carer’s Allowance</h3>
<p>You may be eligible for Carer’s Allowance if you, the person you care for and the type of care you provide meets certain criteria. You need to spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone. This can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helping with washing and cooking</li>
  <li>taking the person you care for to a doctor’s appointment</li>
  <li>helping with household tasks, like managing bills and shopping</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or the person you care for are affected by coronavirus, you can still claim Carer’s Allowance if you provide care remotely. This includes giving emotional support over the phone or online.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance" class="govuk-link">information about eligibility and how to apply for Carer’s Allowance</a>.</p>

<h3>Further sources of support</h3>
<p>For further sources of information or support, you may find information on your local authority’s website or you could contact your local authority.</p>

<p>You can also look on the <a href="https://www.carersuk.org/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Carers UK</a> and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://carers.org/">Carers Trust</a> websites.</p>

<h2>If you or the person you care for has symptoms</h2>

<h3>If someone in a household has symptoms or a positive test or is a close contact of someone who has tested positive</h3>

<p>If someone in your household has symptoms you should follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a>.</p>

<p>If you are notified by NHS Test and Trace or the local authority that you have tested positive or are a close contact of someone who has tested positive, then you have a legal obligation to self-isolate for 10 days. You will be notified of when the period of self-isolation ends. Follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">guidance on how to self-isolate</a>. This means you must remain in your home, or the home of a friend or family member and not leave except in very limited circumstances such as seeking medical assistance.</p>

<p>Your self-isolation period is calculated as beginning on:</p>

<p>a)	the later of either:</p>

<p>i.	the day after the day on which you or the first person in your household reported to NHS Test and Trace that your symptoms started, or</p>

<p>ii.	where that reported date was more than 5 days before the day of the positive test, the fourth day before the day of the test; or</p>

<p>b)	in any other case, for example where you or your household contact did not report symptoms, on the day after the date of the test.</p>

<p>The self-isolation is calculated by identifying the start day in line with the above and continues for the next 10 full days. This means that if, for example, your 10-day isolation period starts on the 15th of the month, your isolation period ends at 11:59pm on the 25th and you can return to your normal routine.</p>

<p>If you do not have symptoms of COVID-19 yourself, you do not need a test. Only arrange a test if you develop COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>If you go on to develop symptoms and your test result is positive, follow the same advice for people with COVID-19 to stay at home and self-isolate for 10 days, starting from:</p>

<p>a)	the later of either:</p>

<p>i.	the day after the day on which you report that symptoms started, or</p>

<p>ii.	where that report date was more than 5 days before the day of your positive test, the fourth day before the day of the test; or</p>

<p>b)	in any other case, on the day after the date of your positive test.</p>

<p>You should do this (and if you are notified by the local authority, NHS Test and Trace or similar, you will be under a legal obligation to do so) regardless of where you already are in your 10-day self-isolation.</p>

<p>You may need to organise emergency alternative care. See ‘what you should be doing to prepare’ above about how to do this and where to find support.</p>

<h3>How to arrange a test</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">apply online here for a test</a> and find out more information about who can have a test and how to access testing. If you have problems using the online service, then you can call 119 if you live in England. You can only get a free NHS test if at least one of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a high temperature</li>
  <li>you have a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>you’ve lost your sense of smell or taste or it’s changed</li>
  <li>you’ve been asked to by a local council</li>
  <li>you’re taking part in a government pilot project</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get a test for someone you live with if they have symptoms.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms, get a test as soon as possible. You need to get the test done in the first 8 days of having symptoms. On days 1 to 7, you can get tested at a site or at home. If you’re ordering a home test kit on day 7, do it by 3pm. On day 8, you need to go to a test site ‒ it’s too late to order a home test kit.</p>

<p>If you’re going into hospital you may need to get tested if you’re due to have surgery or a procedure. The hospital will arrange this for you. Contact your hospital department if you have any questions.</p>

<h3>Visitors where someone in the household has symptoms of coronavirus or a positive test or is a close contact of someone who has tested positive</h3>

<p>Do not invite or allow social visitors to enter your home, including friends and family. If you want to speak to someone who is not a member of your household, use the phone, email or social media.</p>

<p>If you or a family member receive essential care in your home, carers should continue to visit where this is reasonably necessary and follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-providing-home-care" class="govuk-link">provision of home care guidance to reduce the risk of infection</a>.</p>

<p>All non-essential in-house services and repairs should be postponed until the self-isolation period is completed.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<h3>If you live in the same household as the person you care for and the person you care for has symptoms or a positive test, or is a close contact of someone who has tested positive, and you are not in a ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ group with increased risk of severe illness</h3>

<p>You must follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a> as set out above. You can continue to provide care to the person you live with who you usually care for if you are well enough to do so.</p>

<p>You may need to organise emergency alternative care. See section above about how to do this and where to find support.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<h3>If you live in the same household and the person you care for has symptoms or a positive test, or is a close contact of someone who has tested positive, and you are in a ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ group or you have symptoms or a positive test and the person you care for is in the ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ group</h3>

<p>As per the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">guidance for clinically extremely vulnerable groups</a>, you should strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>

<p>Where reasonably necessary friends or family can enter your household to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable or disabled person or emergency assistance. It could also include staying overnight.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<p>If you need alternative care you can contact your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local authority</a> or <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search">healthcare provider</a>. If you do not know how to do this you can contact NHS 111. It may also be helpful to contact your local carers support organisation. You can find out about local carer organisations at <a rel="external" href="https://www.carersuk.org/help-and-advice/get-support/local-support" class="govuk-link">Carers UK</a>.</p>

<h3>If you and the person you care for do not live in the same house and you have symptoms or a positive test or you are a close contact of someone who has tested positive</h3>

<p>You should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance for contacts of people with confirmed coronavirus infection who do not live with the person</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace, including by the NHS COVID-19 app, you may be entitled to a payment of £500 from your local authority under the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance">COVID-19: guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You will not be able to continue caring for the person. If you have not had contact with the person since your symptoms began, the person you care for is well and has no symptoms then you may be able to arrange for other family or friends to provide alternative care.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<p>If you cannot arrange alternative care you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="govuk-link">contact your local authority</a> or <a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search" class="govuk-link">contact your healthcare provider</a>.

<p>If you cannot arrange alternative care you should <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">contact your local authority</a> or <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search">contact your healthcare provider</a> and inform them the person has a positive test or symptoms and explain their care needs.

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-lockdown-stay-at-home" class="govuk-link">national lockdown: stay at home guidance</a> to understand what you can and cannot do.</p>

<h3>If you need time off work to care for a relative who has symptoms or is self-isolating</h3>

<p>You should talk to your employer about your caring needs and what arrangements can be put in place. Find information about Statutory Sick Pay entitlements in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/worker-support" class="govuk-link">work and financial support guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Some people may be entitled to benefits as a carer, such as <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance">Carer’s Allowance</a>.</p>

<h3>Collecting prescriptions when self-isolating</h3>

<p>If you normally collect prescriptions for the person you care for and you are self-isolating, you should look to make alternative arrangements. You should try and seek support from friends and family to assist if possible.</p>

<p>Most pharmacies provide a home delivery service. Telephone them to see if this is available or if there is another scheme running locally to help you access prescriptions.</p>

<p>You can also get help from NHS volunteer responders who can help with things like collecting medication or shopping. Call 0808 196 3646 between 8am and 8pm. There is information here about what support the NHS volunteer responders can offer.</p>

<p>Pharmacy delivery services will be under pressure at the moment, so it is important that you order your repeat prescriptions in good time, to avoid delays in dispensing. Information on repeat prescriptions and delivery services may also be available via your GP practice website.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to arrange an alternative collection, it is possible for someone self-isolating to leave home to obtain medical supplies for someone in the same household.</p>

<p>If the person you care for does not live with you and is self-isolating, then provided you are not self-isolating you can enter their household to drop off a prescription if reasonably necessary. You should distance yourself from the person with symptoms or a positive test as much as possible and follow the guidance.</p>
