<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: facility time reporting</h2>

<p>The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (TULRCA) stipulates that employers have statutory obligations for granting time off for their own employees who are trade union representatives, to enable them to carry out union duties and activities.</p>

<p>In accordance with the 2017 Trade Union Facility Time Publication Regulations, all local authority maintained schools, free schools, and academy trusts, are legally obligated to report their data about Trade Union Facility Time usage and representative activity. They must do this on an annual basis and can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://submit-facility-time.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/register/organisation" rel="external">GOV.UK Facility Time</a> reporting service to do so quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Employers of more than 49 employees who do not employ at least 1 trade union representative should submit a nil return.</p>

<p>If you require additional support <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-trade-union-facility-time-data">facility time guidance</a> provides further detail or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:facilitytime@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">facilitytime@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The deadline for reporting facility time is 31 July 2022.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span>Information: coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing allocations and payments – final arrangements</h2>

<p>We published the final set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges#full-publication-update-history">mass testing allocations</a> on 27 May 2022, which included data for on-site asymptomatic testing site (ATS) tests carried out from 8 January 2022 to 18 February 2022 for mainstream settings, and to 31 March 2022 for special settings.</p>

<p>After these dates ATS testing was no longer required in schools and colleges.</p>

<p>As detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges-conditions-of-grant">conditions of grant</a>, we will be making the payments for this period at the end of July 2022 which will finalise this funding stream and bring it to a close.

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Information:&nbsp;Further Education (FE) Workforce data collection</h2>

<p>Last year we launched the FE Workforce data collection to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>provide a better understanding of the implications of government policy reforms and their impact on the composition of staff and their specialisms, for example the impact of the introduction of T&nbsp;Levels</li>
  <li>provide a greater understanding of pay in the sector,&nbsp;such as the&nbsp;impact of pay on staff recruitment, gender pay gap, underfunding in the sector compared with other education&nbsp;sectors</li>
  <li>reveal skills gaps in the sector and model skills gaps and their&nbsp;impacts.</li>
</ul>

<p>In its first year, participation in the collection was voluntary, but from September 2022, submitting a return is mandatory for all eligible providers. This collection will allow us to build reliable data sets to help design effective and impactful policy to support the sector going forwards.</p>

<p>We will be publishing outcomes in Spring 2023, for the benefit of providers and key stakeholders, such as Ofsted and sector representatives.</p>

<p>The FE Workforce data collection for the 2021 to 2022 academic year will open on 12 September 2022 and will close on 25 November 2022.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-education-workforce-data-collection">Revised documents have been published on GOV.UK</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FE workforce vacancy data collection: supporting document 2021 to 2022</li>
  <li>FE workforce governor data collection: supporting document 2021 to 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there are no changes to the FE workforce vacancy and governor data collections for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>Other documents that require updating will be published later.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Information: ESFA education and skills agreements 2022 to 2023 table of changes published</h2>

<p>We have now <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/esfa-education-and-skills-agreements-2022-to-2023">published a table of changes made to the terms and conditions of the education and skills agreements for 2022 to 2023</a> in comparison to those in place for 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>The changes cover the following funding agreements: College, Employer, Higher Education Institution, Independent Training Provider, Local Authority, Trust, Special post-16 Institution, and Non-maintained Special School. Full versions of the funding agreements will be published at the same link during July.</p>

<p>We will also shortly be publishing funding agreements for 2022 to 2023 to providers for signature via the Manage your education and skills funding service (MyESF) and providers are reminded to ensure that all users continue to have the correct level of access so agreements can be accessed and signed in advance of the new funding year user roles and permissions for MyESF can be found here: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/settings" rel="external">User roles and permissions (skillsfunding.service.gov.uk)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Information: new online toolkit for European Social Fund performance review points</h2>

<p>We are introducing a new online toolkit for European Social Fund (ESF) providers to use as part of future performance review points until the end of the contracts for services in March 2023. The toolkit will replace the spreadsheet currently used at performance review points and is accessed through Submit Learner Data. To ensure a smooth transition, please ensure that all relevant staff have the required user roles to IDAMS to access Submit Learner Data. User roles can be added or amended by your organisation’s super user.</p>

<p>A webinar will be held at 2.30pm on 19 July 2022 to demonstrate the new online toolkit and further information regarding this will shortly be provided via your ESF adviser.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Information: change to payment dates from August 2022</h2>

<p>From August 2022 we are combining the payment dates for the grant funded adult programmes and 16 to 19 funding. Currently adult grants are paid on the 14th working day and they will move to the 18th calendar day or first working day prior.</p>

<ul>
  <li>adult education budget (grant funded)</li>
  <li>advance learner loans bursary (Grant funded)</li>
</ul>

<p>In August 2022, payments will reach bank accounts on the same date (18 August), however, in September adult grant funding will paid on 16 September instead of 20 September.</p>

<p>If you are in receipt of both adult funding and 16 to 19 funding these will be paid together and if applicable will be offset against one another when payments are processed.</p>
