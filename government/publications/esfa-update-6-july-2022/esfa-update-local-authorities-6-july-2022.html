<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Action: complete the section 251 outturn collection for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>The section 251 outturn data collection exercise for 2021 to 2022 is now live.</p>

<p>The deadline for the submission of the section 251 outturn collection 2021 to 2022 is Friday 26 August 2022.</p>

<p>We have <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-2021-to-2022">published guidance and the XML generator</a> for you to begin completion of your outturn statement.</p>

<p>COLLECT will be available for use in mid-July. We will contact you when it is live.</p>

<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/section-251-2021-to-2022">find more information</a> about how to complete the section 251 outturn collection 2021 to 2022 on GOV.UK.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Action: facility time reporting</h2>

<p>The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (TULRCA) stipulates that employers have statutory obligations for granting time off for their own employees who are trade union representatives, to enable them to carry out union duties and activities.</p>

<p>In accordance with the 2017 trade union facility time publication regulations, all local authority maintained schools, free schools, and academy trusts, are legally obligated to report their data about trade union facility time usage and representative activity. They must do this on an annual basis and can use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://submit-facility-time.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/register/organisation" rel="external">facility time reporting service</a>.</p>

<p>Employers of more than 49 employees who do not employ at least 1 trade union representative should submit a nil return.</p>

<p>If you require additional support <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/report-trade-union-facility-time-data">facility time guidance</a> provides further detail or email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:facilitytime@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">facilitytime@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>The deadline for reporting facility time is 31 July 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Action: consultation on proposed early years funding formulae and maintained nursery school supplementary funding</h2>

<p>We have launched a government consultation seeking views on proposed updates to the early years funding formulae and maintained nursery school supplementary funding.</p>

<p>We are proposing to update and adjust the national funding formulae for the early education entitlements for children aged 2, 3 and 4. These formulae are no longer using the most recent data available. Using up-to-date data will help to ensure the funding system remains fair, effective, and responsive to changing levels of need.</p>

<p>We are also investing an additional £10 million into maintained nursery school supplementary funding from 2023 to 2024 and proposing reforms to create a fairer distribution of this funding.</p>

<p>The consultation opened on 4 July and will run until 16 September 2022. You can access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/early-years-funding-formulae">early years funding formulae consultation</a>. We look forward to hearing your views.</p>

<h2>

<span class="number">6. </span>Information: coronavirus (COVID-19) mass testing allocations and payments – final arrangements</h2>

<p>We published the final set of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges#full-publication-update-history">mass testing allocations</a>, which included data for on-site asymptomatic testing site (ATS) tests carried out from 8 January 2022 to 18 February 2022 for mainstream settings, and to 31 March 2022 for special settings.</p>

<p>After these dates ATS testing was no longer required in schools and colleges.</p>

<p>As detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-mass-testing-funding-for-schools-and-colleges-conditions-of-grant">conditions of grant</a>, we will be making the payments for this period at the end of July 2022 which will finalise this funding stream and bring it to a close. You should note that in closing this funding stream, no further adjustments to allocations or payments can be made.</p>

<p>Any queries relating to this funding should be submitted via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-f9f4f5a1-936f-448b-bbeb-9dcdd595f468/AF-Stage-8aa41278-3cdd-45a3-ad87-80cbffb8b992/definition.json&amp;redirectlink=%2Fen&amp;cancelRedirectLink=%2Fen&amp;consentMessage=yes" rel="external">online ESFA enquiry form</a>.</p>

<p>There were a small number of establishments who had yet to register their bank details with us and we will be making a final payment at the end of July to include those who have registered after April.</p>

<p>Once we have made these payments, we will finalise this funding stream and bring it to a close and therefore will be unable to make any further payments after this point.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Information: high needs budgets: effective management in local authorities</h2>

<p>We want to help all LAs to manage their high needs systems sustainably in advance of the SEND and AP green paper.</p>

<p>That’s why we have published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-needs-budgets-effective-management-in-local-authorities">research</a> looking at LAs with high needs systems that are functioning well. The research report offers 10 recommendations for LAs that we encourage them to consider.</p>

<p>We have also published new <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-sustainable-high-needs-systems">guidance</a>, which draws on the learning from the research and the department’s wider intervention work with LAs, in particular through the Safety Valve intervention programme for LAs with the highest Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) deficits.</p>

<p>We encourage all LAs to consider these as tools to help them test and challenge their high needs systems in the immediate future through the Safety Valve, Delivering Better Value and ESFA support programmes. Please see updates on our intervention programmes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1085044/Guidance_on_our_intervention_work_with_local_authorities.pdf" rel="external">here</a>.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span>Information: new online toolkit for European Social Fund (ESF) performance review points</h2>

<p>We are introducing a new online toolkit ESF providers to use as part of future performance review points until the end of the contracts for services in March 2023. The toolkit will replace the spreadsheet currently used at performance review points and is accessed through Submit Learner Data. To ensure a smooth transition, please ensure that all relevant staff have the required user roles to IDAMS in order to access Submit Learner Data. User roles can be added or amended by your organisation’s super user.</p>

<p>A webinar will be held at 2.30pm on 19 July 2022 to demonstrate the new online toolkit and further information regarding this will shortly be provided via your ESF adviser.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span>Information: change to payment dates from August 2022</h2>

<p>From August 2022 we are combining the payment dates for the grant funded adult programmes and 16 to 19 funding. Currently adult grants are paid on the 14th working day and they will move to the 18th calendar day or first working day prior.</p>

<ul>
  <li>adult education budget (grant funded)</li>
  <li>advance learner loans bursary (Grant funded)</li>
</ul>

<p>In August 2022, payments will reach bank accounts on the same date (18 August), however, in September adult grant funding will paid on 16 September instead of 20 September.</p>

<p>If you are in receipt of both adult funding and 16 to 19 funding these will be paid together and if applicable will be offset against one another when payments are processed.</p>
