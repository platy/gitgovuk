<h2>Q1. What is this funding for?</h2>

<p>The Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant is a new funding approach over the next 3 years to inspire and enable social housing residents to restore a sense of community, local pride and belonging especially in those places where they have been lost and drive the delivery of higher quality landlord services that are focussed on their needs through a training, capacity building and access to independent information support programme.</p>

<h2>Q2. How long will the grant be available for?</h2>

<p>Annual funding will be available up to 2025 upon the awarding of the grant. There may be the opportunity for the grant to be extended for a further period from 1 April 2025, subject to funding availability.</p>

<h2>Q3. Who can apply for this funding?</h2>

<p>We welcome applications from organisations that understand the importance of resident empowerment and engagement in holding landlords to account and promoting a sense of community, local pride and belonging, based in England, with expertise and a proven track record of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing training, capacity building and access to independent information programmes within the social housing sector</li>

</li>
  <li>delivering projects that provide value for money</li>
</ul>

<h2>Q4. Do you accept consortium/ partnerships bids?</h2>

<p>We welcome consortium/partnership bids where bidders might want to look for collaborative opportunities that will enhance provision, achieve value for money and generate efficiencies. The application should highlight the role envisaged for each partner in a consortium bid and the skills that they bring. The application must be submitted by the lead partner who will be the accountable organisation for the grant. The grant funding agreement for a consortium bid will be between DLUHC and the accountable organisation only.</p>

<p>You do not need to have a formal agreement between consortium members in place at this stage. If your bid is successful, you will need a consortium agreement, and this will require the approval of DLUHC prior to any funding being released.</p>

<h2>Q5. What is the deadline for applying?</h2>

<p>The deadline for applying is 11:59pm on 2 October 2022 and completed application forms and supporting documents should be emailed to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SHWPPMO@levellingup.gov.uk">SHWPPMO@levellingup.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Q7. When will applicants be notified if they are successful?</h2>

<p>Applicants will be informed of the outcome of their bid in October 2022.&nbsp;We will aim to enter discussions with preferred bidders in October.</p>

<h2>Q8. How will applications be assessed?</h2>

<p>We will complete eligibility and due diligence checks using standard government tools and procedures for all applications received by the closing date. Applications passing eligibility and due diligence checks will be evaluated against 5 specific categories: The Applicant, Quality of Proposal, Outputs and Outcomes, Programme Management, Governance and Risk, Value for money. The evaluation will lead to the identification of a preferred bidder.</p>

<h2>Q10. Is there a minimum annual turnover required for potential providers to be considered?</h2>

<p>There is not a minimum annual turnover stipulated for applicants in the prospectus.</p>

<h2>Q11. Is the grant for organisations to establish their own training?</h2>

The grant is not intended for landlords to establish training programmes limited to their own residents.</p>

<h2>Q12. Is the £500K Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant the overall amount of funding available for all applications, or is the £500K the limit for each application?</h2>

<p>The Department is looking to award the grant of up to £500K to a single applicant or a lead partner in a consortium bid for the provision of a Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Programme, for the training capacity building and access to independent information for social housing residents. There are not multiple grant awards.</p>

<h2>Q13. Are DLUHC expecting to receive a bid from us?</h2>

<p>All applications are welcome, and we will assess them under the criteria and guidance as set out in the prospectus.</p>

<h2>Q14. Does DLUHC have a preference for individual or consortium bids?</h2>

<p>The Department does not have a preference for individual or partner/consortium bids. There is no additional scoring weighting for either an individual or a partner/consortium bid.</p>

<h2>Q15. Relevant knowledge and experience – is experience of managing similar programmes referring to government funded programmes?</h2>

<p>No. This experience is not limited to government funded programmes.</p>

<h2>Q16. Relevant knowledge and experience – does a national support offer have any particular threshold?</h2>

<p>No. It is up to bidders to demonstrate how their prior experiences give them the ability to deliver support across England.</p>

<h2>Q17. Proposed activities – should these be offers / programmes that are already established, or can they relate to new offers?</h2>

<p>The funding is for a programme that provides a diverse spectrum of training, capacity building and access to independent information. We are open to tried and rested methodologies, but also encourage innovation; the important thing is that activities deliver the objectives set out in the prospectus.</p>

<h2>Q18. Stakeholder engagement to inform the bid – who are the government thinking of in considering this? Are stakeholders the tenants and residents who will access the services or commissioners / partners / other delivery agents?</h2>

<p>It is for bidders to decide which stakeholders they want to engage with. Both residents and delivery partners could be useful groups to engage in developing a programme.</p>

<h2>Q19. Outputs and outcomes – do you have a sense for the balance of activities, i.e. single items such as information verses on-going training provision?</h2>

<p>It is for bidders to decide the balance of activities to meet the objectives set out in the prospectus.</p>

<h2>Q20. E-learning – are you looking for specialist software to facilitate this?</h2>

<p>The prospectus does not specify any specialist software for e-learning; however, bidders should note the prospectus asks that training/learning/support should reflect an accessible, inclusive approach for the audience of social housing residents.</p>

<h2>Q21. Management – does the Gantt Chart need to be prepared and supplied in a particular format?</h2>

<p>The Gantt Chart does not need to be prepared and supplied in a particular format. The bid team has access to standard office software, including Microsoft Office and PDF viewers.</p>

<h2>Q22. On reviewing the prospectus it appears that the funding needs to be utilised to deliver a consistent programme across the country as opposed to running a local programme only – is that correct?</h2>

<p>If your organisation wants to provide a programme that will be accessible to all social housing residents in England and meets the objectives and outcomes set out in the prospectus, it will be welcome to apply. If your organisation only wants to provide a local programme only, it should not apply.</p>

<h2>Q23. Eligibility – can a company limited by shares be part of a consortium as the non-contracting body?</h2>

<p>No, under our grant eligibility criteria a company limited by shares cannot be part of a consortium bid even if they are not the lead applicant. However, such a company could be a supplier to the grant recipient.</p>

<h2>Q24. Are housing associations eligible to apply either as the lead partner or as part of a consortium bid?</h2>

<p>Housing associations usually have a governing document that will explain the organisation’s legal status. It will be the organisation’s legal status that will determine if it’s eligible to apply, rather than if it’s a housing association.</p>

<p>To be an eligible organisation, applicants must be one or more of the following types of organisations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Charity – an organisation registered as a Charity with UK charity regulators</li>

</ul>

<p>These lists are not exhaustive. Advice should be sought if an applicant believes that the status of their organisation is not listed.</p>
