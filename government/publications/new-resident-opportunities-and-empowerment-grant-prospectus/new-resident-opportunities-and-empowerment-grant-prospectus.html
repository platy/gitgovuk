<h3>Contacting the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC)</h3>

<p>General enquiries: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:SHWPPMO@levellingup.gov.uk">SHWPPMO@levellingup.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Government is committed to Levelling Up. This means introducing new legislation to improve the quality and regulation of social housing, give residents performance information so that they can hold their landlords to account and ensure that when residents make a complaint, landlords take quick and effective action to put things right.</p>

<p>Social housing plays a crucial role for around 4 million households in the social housing sector in England, providing stability and security and delivering local services. Although some residents play an active role in deciding how those services are delivered, many others lack the awareness or the confidence to participate, or their landlord fails to engage with them on these matters.</p>

<p>In our social housing white paper, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-charter-for-social-housing-residents-social-housing-white-paper">‘The Charter for Social Housing Residents’</a>, government emphasised the importance of having residents involved in decisions regarding their homes and communities. However, whilst some landlords engage well with their residents, this is not consistent across the sector. The Charter committed to delivering a new opportunities and empowerment programme open to all social housing residents, to support their effective engagement with landlords.</p>

<p>For this approach to operate effectively, residents need to be aware of their rights and opportunities; understand the benefits of getting involved in the landlord’s decision-making process and be confident in engaging with them. Crucially, they need to be inspired to seize opportunities to get involved, whether this be through tenant panels, scrutiny groups, local dispute resolution, taking advantage of opportunities such as housing management via local management agreements or the Right to Manage, or playing a more active role in their community.</p>

<p>Research conducted with residents demonstrates that a large majority of respondents considered that being involved makes a difference and produces beneficial outcomes. For example, more tenant orientated services and service improvements, a catalyst for residents to meet neighbours and a means of tackling isolation, improved confidence, self-esteem, and employability that develop amongst involved residents, inspiring landlord staff they work with to go the extra mile.</p>

<p>Resident empowerment also makes good business sense for landlords since it provides effective challenge about service delivery and standards, improve resident satisfaction rates, generate efficiencies, financial benefits, better value for money, social dividend, and community benefits.</p>

<p>While some residents already play an active role in their community others may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not understand how they can get involved</li>
  <li>feel they do not have the skills or confidence to play an enhanced role</li>
  <li>not be receiving support from their landlord in gaining the skills and confidence to get involved in engagement activities</li>
  <li>benefit from access to independent information and signposting not provided by their landlord</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, many residents are missing out on opportunities to have their say about local housing or play a more influential role in their local community.</p>

<p>Residents need to feel confident in their ability to engage with, and challenge landlords. Providing them with training and capacity building activities and access to independent information can help them to do this successfully.</p>

<h2>Part 1: Grant summary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> What is the new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant?</h3>

<p>The Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Programme Grant is new funding for the next 3 years to inspire and enable social housing residents to restore a sense of community, local pride and belonging especially in those places where they have been lost and drive delivery of higher quality landlord services that are focussed on their needs through provision of a training, capacity building and access to independent information support programme. There may be the opportunity for the grant to be extended for a further period from 1 April 2025, subject to funding availability.</p>

<p>The programme should be complementary to the progress government has already made on implementing the social housing white paper. Our complaints awareness campaign has raised residents’ awareness about how to make complaints. Our anti-social behaviour information package sets out the help and support available for residents who are experiencing anti-social behaviour and our residents panel will bring together social housing residents from across the country so they can directly share their views with government and ministers on our approach to driving up the quality of social housing.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2. </span> Objectives of the new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant Programme</h3>

<p>That a diverse spectrum of training and capacity building opportunities, and access to independent information are offered to social housing residents that will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inspire residents to seize opportunities for engaging on a range of housing issues by gaining the skills and confidence to engage effectively with landlords</li>
  <li>provide opportunities for residents to upskill so that can play a more influential part in the decisions that affect them and their communities directly</li>
  <li>give residents the tools to take an active role in how their homes are managed</li>
  <li>lead to residents creating or joining scrutiny and/or other panels</li>
  <li>empower residents to take over the delivery of landlord services</li>
  <li>share opportunities so that residents can share ideas and learn from others about how to make a difference in their community</li>
  <li>drive delivery of higher quality landlord services that are focused on residents’ needs</li>
</ul>

<p>The commitment for this funding represents a potential of investment of up to £500K covering the period October 2022 – March 2025.</p>

<p>The indicative budgets are a guide for bidders. The application form will give bidders the opportunity to provide costs for activities that will be undertaken to facilitate the delivery of the objectives. DLUHC will seek to ensure that bids are cost effective and represent best value for money, whilst maintaining a strong focus on achieving sustained outcomes for residents.</p>

<h4>Aims</h4>

<p>We want to see more residents seizing opportunities to engage with their landlord about local services, getting involved in the key local decisions and influencing local housing services. Beyond this, we also want to see residents helping to resolve issues that affect them and their wider community and improve where they live to restore a sense of community, local pride and belonging. Recognising that some residents may not be aware of the opportunities or may not feel they have the knowledge, skills, or confidence to engage, we are looking for innovative ideas from applicants to deliver a programme that empowers and inspires residents.</p>

<h4>Activities</h4>

<p>The programme needs to cover a range of opportunities and empowerment options. It should also offer skills training for tenants so that they are confident to challenge their landlord and get involved in local decision making.</p>

<p>We would like to hear applicants’ innovative ideas for how this new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Programme could deliver a range of learning and support, covering a spectrum of resident empowerment activities. This includes proposed course/learning/support opportunities, its associated content and how that would boost residents’ capability, skills, and confidence to engage locally. It might include an element of in-depth training that offers a stimulating residential learning environment or the opportunity to gain accreditations.</p>

<p>The application should also identify the information that would be made available to residents to explain their opportunities and rights on ways to get involved, drawing on existing information and other good practice materials as well as developing new products to fill gaps and for new and emerging policy development. Recognising residents’ preferences, the training/learning/support should reflect an accessible, inclusive approach and consider the use of digital opportunities. Through this work, residents will be given the tools to better influence and hold landlords to account and drive delivery of higher quality services that are focused on their needs.</p>

<h4>Audience</h4>

<p>The programme should offer social housing residents a range of accessible ways in which they can learn, such as basic (online) information about opportunities and rights, local training provision, and free e-learning on key resident empowerment themes. We therefore wish to know how applicants intend to address existing gaps in provision. We are interested in how you will reach underrepresented demographics and target residents who are new to engagement activities and/or haven’t had the opportunity to undertake training previously. This will enable residents to access training anytime/anywhere and support the delivery of the programme on a national level.</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

<p>We would expect applications to detail the outcomes to be delivered enabling residents to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>become more confident to engage with their landlord</li>
  <li>understand their opportunities and rights on ways to get involved</li>
  <li>take an active role in influencing how landlord services are delivered to drive delivery of higher quality services that are focused on their needs</li>
  <li>increase their knowledge and understanding of social housing and communities</li>
  <li>hold their landlord to account</li>
  <li>play a more active role in their community</li>
  <li>take control of local services</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3. </span> What we are looking for</h3>

<p>The application form provides the opportunity for applicants to propose their own suggestions to meet the objectives of the programme. We are open to tried and tested methodologies, but also encourage innovation particularly based on what the sector learned from tenant engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>It is important that social housing residents from across England can take advantage of this new opportunities and empowerment programme. We therefore wish to know how applicants would ensure their reach is truly national in support of our levelling up ambition. Applications should, therefore, demonstrate that they have a track record in delivery at a national level.</p>

<p>Our aim is to give a grant to an eligible organisation that’s mission and goals are consistent with our aims of empowering residents to play a bigger role in their local community and be able to engage effectively with landlords and hold them to account.</p>

<h4>Consortium bids</h4>

<p>Bidders might want to look for collaborative opportunities that will enhance provision, achieve value for money and generate efficiencies. The application should highlight the role envisaged for each partner in a consortium bid and the skills that they bring. The application must be submitted by the lead partner who will be the accountable organisation for the grant. The grant funding agreement for a consortium bid will be between DLUHC and the accountable organisation only.</p>

<p>You do not need to have a formal agreement between consortium members in place at this stage. If your bid is successful, you will need a consortium agreement, and this will require the approval of DLUHC prior to any funding being released.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4. </span> Eligibility</h3>

<h3>
<span class="number">5. </span> Process for assessing applications</h3>

<p>The department will complete eligibility and due diligence checks using standard government tools and procedures for all applications received by the closing date.</p>

<p>Applications passing eligibility and due diligence checks will be evaluated against 5 specific categories: The Applicant, Quality of Proposal, Outputs and Outcomes, Programme Management, Governance and Risk, Value for money.</p>

<p>The evaluation process is described in Part 4 of the prospectus. The evaluation will lead to the identification of a preferred bidder. We will then begin a process of negotiation and refinement of the proposals to assist in the development of the Grant funding award and agreement. The negotiation will include a review of the proposed pricing schedule, key performance indicators (KPIs) and evaluation.</p>

<p>Bidders should be aware that their application should not be seen as a full and final offer, DLUHC reserves the right to negotiate with preferred applicants. Applicants should also be aware that DLUHC reserves the right to invite multiple preferred bidders for negotiation and refinement of any bids made.</p>

<p>DLUHC reserves the right not to award the Grant.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6. </span> Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>DLUHC is providing funding for the new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant. DLUHC will assess bids and provide funding to one organisation, or a lead organisation with a consortium bid. Roles and responsibilities for both parties are detailed below:</p>

<p>DLUHC’s role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review funding proposals against the scoring criteria set out in Part 4 of this document</li>
  <li>undertake due diligence of applicants</li>
  <li>determine allocation of funding based on the published scoring criteria</li>
  <li>notify applicants of funding decisions.</li>
  <li>establish a Grant Funding Agreement with a selected organisation</li>
  <li>provide funding as agreed in the Grant Funding Agreement</li>
  <li>establish and undertake a monitoring and evaluation regime for the duration of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Organisation’s role:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure proposals submitted are in the standardised form and contain clear costings, milestones, outputs, and outcomes for activities</li>
  <li>cooperate fully with the assessment and due diligence process</li>
  <li>if selected for funding, the grant recipient must sign a Grant Funding Agreement with DLUHC</li>
  <li>if selected for funding, the grant recipient must deliver proposals in accordance with the Grant Agreement</li>
  <li>the grant recipient must participate in monitoring and evaluation as set out in Section 8 below</li>
  <li>the grant recipient must observe the requirements of PCR 2015 Public Contract Regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7. </span> VAT statement</h3>

<p>DLUHC intends to award a Grant to stimulate this activity. This Grant will be governed by a Grant Funding Agreement. DLUHC does not intend for there to be a contractual relationship with the Grant recipient. It intends paying the Grant on the receipt of acceptable progress reports, a Grant claim form, and the delivery of agreed outcomes. It will not pay the Grant on the basis of an invoice. In consequence, applicants must reassure themselves as to their VAT liability – either to be paid or unable to be recovered.</p>

<p>Any Grant award will not be increased subsequently to meet unforeseen VAT costs. The proposed budget submitted by the applicant should be based therefore, net of recoverable VAT costs in line with VAT rules of grant payments.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8. </span> Governance, monitoring and evaluation</h3>

<p>The Grant recipient must comply with the new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Grant governance, monitoring, and evaluation requirements, which are as follow:</p>

<h4>8.1 Governance</h4>

<p>The Grant recipient will be in regular contact with the Resident Engagement Team within DLUHC’s Social Housing Quality and Residents Division.</p>

<p>The new Resident Opportunities and Empowerment Programme Grant outcomes and expenditure will be recorded and monitor by the Resident Engagement Team on a quarterly basis. The programme will report to the Social Housing Quality and Residents Non-Regulation Sub-Board.</p>

<h4>8.2 Monitoring</h4>

<p>The Grant recipient will be expected to provide quarterly progress reports detailing performance against targets and financial claims to the Department which will be reviewed in a monitoring meeting prior to funding being released.</p>

<p>The monitoring meeting attendance will comprise of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chair (DLUHC Resident Engagement Lead)</li>
  <li>Programme Manager (DLUHC Resident Engagement Policy Officer)</li>
  <li>Programme Provider Representatives</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the monitoring process a review will take place to determine whether funding will continue into the next financial year.</p>

<h4>8.3 Key Performance Indicators</h4>

<p>Crucially, we also want to see applicants specifying the spectrum of outputs that they would deliver from the Grant, for example in terms of the number of residents trained/supported, the types of training available, number of attendees, diversity, new to training, etc and the information that would be available.</p>

<p>DLUHC will provide a core set of key performance indicators (KPIs) which the Grant recipient will be expected to report against for performance monitoring purposes. DLUHC’s core KPIs are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).</p>

<p>For the monitoring and reporting of KPIs, any personal data that might be collected by the grant recipient must be anonymised as per UK GDPR. A summary of DLUHC’S core KPIs can be found below in table 2. In addition, applicants are invited to provide additional KPIs that would demonstrate the outputs and quality of their proposal.</p>

<p>As part of the application process, bidders will be asked to provide expected numbers for DLUHC’s core KPIs and propose any additional KPIs as part of the project delivery. As part of the negotiation process with preferred bidders, DLUHC will agree milestones. The set milestones will be included in the Grant Funding Agreement based on the programme’s delivery plan and information provided in the Grant recipient’s application.</p>

<p>Following application to the grant programme, DLUHC will work with preferred applicants to agree the final set of KPIs in advance of the Grant award (see success and impact section 8.4 below). All KPIs will be reviewed on a quarterly basis as agreed through the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>

<h4>8.4 Success and impact</h4>

<p>Success and impact of the programme will be evaluated against the core outputs and outcomes of the successful proposal and KPIs listed [table 2] during the quarterly monitoring meetings (which will be informed by quarterly narrative report and KPIs).</p>

<p>The Grant recipient will be expected to complete an evaluation at the end of the programme to demonstrate the reach and impact of the programme in delivering the objectives. This should be presented as an accessible, publishable report setting out, but not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the programme was structured to deliver the objectives</li>
  <li>key quantitative and qualitative data</li>
  <li>resident case studies/testimonials</li>
  <li>feedback from residents</li>
  <li>feedback from landlords</li>
  <li>key learnings</li>
</ul>

<p>The Grant recipient will be asked to produce an annual Statement of Grant Usage to be submitted within six months of the end of each financial year.</p>

<h2>Part 4: Scoring process</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1. </span> Marking guidance, scoring and weightings</h3>

<p>Bids will be assessed by a panel comprised of representatives from DLUHC’s Social Housing Directorate and Commercial Grants teams against the 15 criteria listed in table 3 and table 4 below:</p>

<p>Each criterion will be scored 0-3. Any application that scores 0 against any criterion will be disqualified. Each criterion is weighted to reflects its importance to this funding programme. The score for each criterion will be multiplied by its weighting.</p>

<p>The scores for all the criteria will be added to give a total score for the application. The maximum total score is 300.</p>

<p>The total score will be used to compare against other applications. The application with the highest total score will be identified as the preferred bidder. Where two applications are scored equally, or are very similar, DLUHC may make further enquires before identifying a preferred bidder.</p>

<p>The score against each criterion will also inform subsequent discussions with the preferred bidder.</p>

<p>The final decision as to which application receives what level of funding will rest with the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.</p>

<p>DLUHC reserves the right to vary these conditions and the right to either withdraw or reduce the funding if reasonably required, in line with the terms and conditions set out within the Grant Funding Agreement.</p>
