<p>Throughout this guidance, the term ‘cattle’ includes farmed bison and Asiatic water buffalo.</p>

<p>Moving cattle from areas with high incidence rates of <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> in England or Wales risks introducing <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> to areas with lower incidence rates of <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr>. Scotland is officially <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr>-free so it is important not to allow <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> to spread over the border.</p>

<p>England, Wales and Scotland have different testing rules. If you’re moving cattle between different parts of Great Britain, you need to know the <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing requirements of the country and area.</p>

<p>Your cattle may need to have <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> tests before and after you move them (pre-movement and post-movement tests). This reduces the risk of undetected bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> from spreading.</p>

<h2>Arranging pre-movement and post-movement tests</h2>

<p>Before and after you move cattle, you may need to arrange and pay for pre-movement and post-movement skin tests. This is unless you have a <a class="govuk-link" href="#when-you-can-use-government-funded-test-results-to-move-cattle">routine surveillance test or herd test arranged or recently completed</a>.</p>

<p>Check your <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-testing-intervals">bovine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing intervals</a>. Most individual herd testing intervals are set to the testing interval of their area but some may differ. If the <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing interval of your herd is changing, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>) will send you a <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing interval statement.</p>

<p>If you do not have a routine surveillance test or herd test arranged or recently completed, you must arrange a test with your private vet. Your vet must be an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/official-vets/index.htm" rel="external">Official Veterinarian</a> (<abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr>) registered with the <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> cattle testing panel. Your vet must be authorised to carry out <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing.</p>

<p>In England, an <a class="govuk-link" href="http://apha.defra.gov.uk/External_OV_Instructions/Approved_Tuberculin_Testers_England/ATT_Eligibility_Training.html" rel="external">Approved Tuberculin Tester</a> (<abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr>) can test cattle, but you cannot use this test for export outside of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The cost of a <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test is a private transaction between you and your <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr> or <abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr>. Let your <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr> or <abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr> know as soon as cattle need testing. This will help them fit the test in so you can move your cattle when you want to.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr> or <abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr> will inject tuberculins into the skin of the cattle’s neck. After 3 days, they will complete the process by checking cattle for reactions to the test.</p>

<h2>Pre-movement testing rules</h2>

<p>Pre-movement tests are valid for 60 days from the date of the injection, which is day zero of the 60-day period.</p>

<p>All cattle from herds in England and Wales must have tested negative to a <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test within 60 days before movement, unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are under 42 days old</li>
  <li>they come from a herd tested less than annually (England)</li>
  <li>the animal, herd or type of movement <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">is exempt</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re a cattle keeper in England or Wales, you must ensure cattle have tested negative to a <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test within 60 days before moving to Scotland. This is unless cattle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are under 42 days old</li>
  <li>have lived all their life in the low risk area (<abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr>) of England – cattle from annual or more frequently tested herds in the <abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> still need testing</li>
  <li>are being sent directly to slaughter</li>
  <li>are moving to a show or exhibition for less than 24 hours and returning to their original premises</li>
</ul>

<p>Cattle keepers must follow their country’s rules for pre-movement testing when moving cattle to other countries within GB.</p>

<p>Although pre-movement testing is not currently required for movements of cattle from Scotland to England or Wales, there may be times where recipients in England or Wales require cattle moving from Scotland to be pre-movement tested.</p>

<p>In Wales, you can use <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-and-use-bar-code-labels-for-your-holding">barcode labels</a> on cattle passports to show the date of your cattle’s last negative <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test.</p>

<p>If a pre-movement test is positive and finds one or more reactors, movement restrictions will apply to your herd. Your herd will be subject to the controls applied to a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bovine-tb-getting-your-cattle-tested-in-england#tb-breakdown">breakdown herd</a>.</p>

<p>In Wales, if a pre-movement test finds one or more inconclusive reactors (<abbr title="inconclusive reactors">IRs</abbr>), movement restrictions will apply to your herd. In England and Scotland, movement restrictions will apply to the <abbr title="inconclusive reactors">IRs</abbr> or the whole of the herd depending on the herd’s <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> history.</p>

<h2>Post-movement testing rules</h2>

<p>In England, you must arrange post-movement tests for cattle moved to herds in the <abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the high risk area (<abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr>) and edge area of England</li>
  <li>Wales</li>
</ul>

<p>In Wales, you must arrange post-movement tests for cattle moved to herds in the low <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> area from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the high and intermediate <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> areas of Wales</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr> and edge areas of England</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>In Scotland, you must arrange post-movement tests for cattle from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr> and edge areas of England</li>
  <li>Wales</li>
  <li>Northern Ireland</li>
</ul>

<p>You must carry out post-movement tests on cattle between 60 and 120 days after their arrival at your premises.</p>

<p>There are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">exemptions to post-movement testing cattle</a> in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>You must not move cattle that need a post-movement test from your premises until they receive a negative test result, unless they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>going directly to slaughter (within 120 days of the movement onto your premises)</li>
  <li>going to a slaughter gathering (a slaughter market or slaughter collection centre) (England and Wales)</li>
  <li>going to an Approved Finishing Unit (<abbr title="Approved Finishing Unit">AFU</abbr>) (England and Wales)</li>
  <li>going to a Licensed Finishing Unit (<abbr title="Licensed Finishing Unit">LFU</abbr>) (England-only)</li>
  <li>moving from a certified quarantine unit under a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/bovine-tb-moving-cattle-to-non-exempt-show" rel="external">general licence to a non-exempt agricultural show</a> (Wales-only)</li>
  <li>under licence issued by an <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> inspector</li>
</ul>

<p>You must post-movement test cattle first if slaughter is more than 120 days after arrival to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> of England</li>
  <li>low <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> area of Wales</li>
  <li>Scotland</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you can use government-funded test results to move cattle</h2>

<p>Routine <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> surveillance tests or herd tests paid for by the government can count as pre-movement and post-movement tests.</p>

<p>You can use a government-funded test as a pre-movement test if you move cattle within 60 days of a negative result. This is 60 days after the injection date of the skin test.</p>

<p>This does not apply to herds in Wales that have recently had movement restrictions lifted after a persistent breakdown. This is a breakdown lasting 18 months or more. After a completed releasing breakdown test, you must pre-movement test cattle at least 60 days later.</p>

<p>You can use a government-funded test instead of a post-movement test if cattle have been in the <abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> of England, the low <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> area of Wales, or Scotland for at least 60 days at the time of the test. Tests done within 60 and 120 days are valid post-movement tests.</p>

<p>If cattle are herd tested before the 60 days, you’ll need to do another post-movement test.</p>

<p>You can discuss which animals to test with your <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr>, <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> veterinary inspector or <abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr>. They may need to see proof of the dates of the last test.</p>

<h2>Exemptions and evidence of testing</h2>

<p>Some cattle, herds or movements are <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">exempt from pre-movement and post-movement tests</a>.</p>

<p>You should keep evidence for at least 3 years if you move cattle exempt from <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing.</p>

<p>Negative skin test results recorded on <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test charts (Form TB52c) by your <abbr title="Official Veterinarian">OV</abbr> or <abbr title="Approved Tuberculin Tester">ATT</abbr> confirm that you can move tested cattle. You must keep these charts for 3 years and 60 days as evidence of <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing.</p>

<p><abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test charts also provide information on disease and testing history. Prospective buyers are likely to ask for evidence of tests and movements to help them decide on the level of <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> risk they are taking on.</p>

<p>If you’re a buyer, you should ask for evidence of pre-movement tests within 60 days before the proposed movement date. This is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">unless the animal, the herd or the movement is exempt</a>. You can also check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ibtb.co.uk/" rel="external">ibTB map</a> showing the <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> status of cattle herds in England and Wales.</p>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> cannot give out individual herd details.</p>

<h2>Failure to get cattle tested</h2>

<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> routinely checks cattle movements and cattle testing records. It reports suspected breaches to local authorities to investigate non-compliance. Anyone that fails to comply with <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> testing rules may be subject to formal enforcement action including prosecution.</p>

<p>Failure to <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test cattle within the deadline may be a breach of the Statutory Management Requirements. This applies under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cross-compliance">cross compliance rules</a> of the Basic Payment Scheme (<abbr title="Basic Payment Scheme">BPS</abbr>) farm subsidy schemes. It could mean reductions to your scheme payments. It may also affect the compensation paid if the test finds one or more reactors.</p>

<h2>Receiving cattle that are not pre-movement tested in England and Wales</h2>

<p>If you receive cattle that are not pre-movement tested, you should isolate the cattle as soon as possible. You must <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-apha">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> and arrange and pay for a private <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> finds that you have received cattle without a pre-movement test, it will restrict the cattle until you test them. This is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">unless the cattle are exempt</a>.</p>

<h2>Receiving cattle that are not pre-movement tested in Scotland</h2>

<p>If you receive cattle from England or Wales that are not pre-movement tested, you must pay for an immediate post-movement test.</p>

<p>If <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> finds that you have received cattle without a pre-movement test, it will restrict the movement of your whole herd. This is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">unless the cattle are exempt</a>.</p>

<p>Movement restrictions apply until the received cattle have had an immediate post-movement test.</p>

<p>If cattle come from Wales, or the <abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr> and edge area of England, you should post-movement test cattle again between 60 and 120 days after their arrival. This must be at least 60 days after the previous test.</p>

<h2>Moving cattle into your herd without post-movement testing in England, Scotland and Wales</h2>

<p>If <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> finds that you have moved cattle that need post-movement testing into your herd without completing the tests, it will restrict the movement of your whole herd. Movement restrictions apply until the received cattle have had an immediate post-movement test.</p>

<p>In England and Wales, if <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> finds that cattle without post-movement testing have moved from your herd to another herd, it will restrict those cattle in the receiving herd. Movement restrictions apply until the received cattle have had an immediate post-movement test.</p>

<p>Pre-movement and post-movement testing rules apply to cattle moving between permanent land and <abbr title="temporary county parish holdings">tCPHs</abbr>. This is <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">unless the animals, herd or movements are exempt</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-movement and post-movement testing rules do not apply to cattle moving between permanent land and temporary land linked through a temporary land association (<abbr title="temporary land association">TLA</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Moving cattle to and from common land in England and Wales</h2>

<p>Pre-movement and post-movement testing rules apply to cattle moving to and from common land in England and Wales. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">Check the exemptions</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-apha">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> if it’s not possible to pre-movement or post-movement test your cattle at common land.</p>

<h2>Moving cattle to shows</h2>

<p>Pre-movement and post-movement testing rules apply to cattle attending or returning from shows in England and Wales <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bovine-tb-pre-movement-and-post-movement-testing-in-great-britain/cattle-movements-exemptions-from-pre-movement-or-post-movement-bovine-tb-testing">unless the show is exempt</a>.</p>

<p>Cattle moving to a show in Scotland from England or Wales require a pre-movement test within 60 days prior to movement, unless they are under 42 days old or are moving from a 4-yearly tested herd in the <abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> of England. Cattle do not require a post-movement test, providing they return to the same premises of origin.</p>

<p>When cattle need pre-movement testing, you can move cattle to multiple shows as long as they go back to their original premises or to slaughter within 60 days of the negative test.</p>

<p>You should not book a <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test within 60 days of completion of the previous <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> test as this is not an authorised test.</p>

<p>Cattle must stay on the premises in the <abbr title="low risk area">LRA</abbr> of England until you complete a post-movement test if they’re returning from non-exempt shows in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr> or edge area of England</li>
  <li>Wales</li>
</ul>

<p>Cattle must stay on the premises in the low <abbr title="tuberculosis">TB</abbr> area of Wales until you complete a post-movement test if they’re returning from non-exempt shows in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>other areas of Wales</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="high risk area">HRA</abbr> or edge area of England</li>
</ul>

<p>In Wales, there is an exemption to this by using a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://gov.wales/livestock-quarantine-units" rel="external">certified quarantine unit</a>.</p>
