<h3>Pre-movement testing Exempt Markets (<abbr title="Exempt Markets">EMs</abbr>) in England and Wales</h3>

<p>In England, <abbr title="Exempt Markets">EMs</abbr> sell cattle that have not been pre-movement tested. Market operators can also accept pre-movement tested cattle into an <abbr title="Exempt Market">EM</abbr>.</p>

<p>In Wales, <abbr title="Exempt Markets">EMs</abbr> sell cattle from annually or more frequently tested herds that should have been pre-movement tested but are not.</p>

<p>You cannot move cattle from <abbr title="Exempt Markets">EMs</abbr> unless moving directly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>slaughter</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Exempt Finishing Unit">EFU</abbr> (England-only)</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Approved Finishing Unit">AFU</abbr> in an annual (or more frequent) testing area in England</li>
  <li>an <abbr title="Approved Finishing Unit">AFU</abbr> in the High TB Area of Wales</li>
  <li>their original premises, except if the origin herd is tested every 4 years (‘4-yearly testing’) in England when no return is allowed</li>
</ul>

<p>See a list of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-markets-for-cattle-approved-premises"><abbr title="Exempt Markets">EMs</abbr> for cattle in England and Wales</a>.</p>

<p>For more information <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/contact-apha">contact <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> or your local market operator.</p>

<h3>Pre-movement testing exempt finishing units (<abbr title="Exempt Finishing Units">EFUs</abbr>) in England</h3>

<p><abbr title="Exempt Finishing Units">EFUs</abbr> operate in England but not in Wales. They allow beef producers to buy animals that have not been pre-movement tested to finish them for slaughter. <abbr title="Exempt Finishing Units">EFUs</abbr> meet strict conditions to minimise the risk of disease spread from the premises so must be approved by <abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>.</p>

<p>Operators can also accept pre-movement tested cattle and exempt cattle.</p>

<p>You cannot move cattle from <abbr title="Exempt Finishing Units">EFUs</abbr> unless moving to slaughter. This can be directly to the slaughterhouse or through an approved slaughter market or collecting centre.</p>

<p>See a list of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-finishing-units-for-cattle-approved-premises"><abbr title="Exempt Finishing Units">EFUs</abbr> in England</a>.</p>
