<h2>Why you need to claim Universal Credit</h2>

<p>If you have received a letter (called a Migration Notice) from the Department for Work and Pensions (<abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>), then some of your existing benefits will be ending soon. See the following list to find out which ones.</p>

<h2>Benefits that are ending</h2>

<p>Universal Credit is replacing the following benefits for people of working age:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
</ul>

<p>Other benefits, such as Personal Independent Payments (<abbr title="Personal Independence Payment">PIP</abbr>), will not be affected by these changes.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>To continue receiving financial support you must claim Universal Credit.</p>
</div>

<h2>Who Universal Credit is for</h2>

<p>Universal Credit is for people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are on a low income</li>
  <li>need help with your living costs</li>
  <li>are working (including self-employed or part time)</li>
  <li>are out of work</li>
  <li>have a health condition that affects your ability to work</li>
</ul>

<h3>Students and people on tax credits</h3>

<p>Two of the normal Universal Credit eligibility rules have been changed for people who receive a Migration Notice letter.</p>

<h4>Tax credits</h4>

<p>If you receive tax credits you can make a claim even if you have savings or capital of more than £16,000. After 12 months, normal eligibility rules will apply.</p>

<h4>Students</h4>

<p>If you are in full-time advanced education (such as attending university) you can make a claim to Universal Credit even if you or both you and your partner are in full time advanced education.</p>

<h2>How to claim Universal Credit</h2>

<p>You can apply for Universal Credit online.</p>

<p>You need to create an account. You use it to make a claim. You must complete your claim within 28 days of creating your account or you will have to start again.</p>

<p>If you live with your partner, you will both need to create accounts. You’ll link them together when you claim. You cannot claim by yourself.</p>

<p>If you cannot claim online, you can claim by phone through the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Universal Credit Migration Notice helpline</a>.</p>

<p>When you or your partner make a claim to Universal Credit some of your existing benefits will stop and you cannot go back to those benefits as they are ending.</p>

<p>You will not have to undertake a Work Capability Assessment (<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>) again when you move to Universal Credit if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’ve been receiving Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>you’ve already completed a&nbsp;<abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>you’ve been assessed whilst claiming&nbsp;<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If your <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> is due for a review, you will need to have another assessment. Your review date for <abbr title="Work Capability Assessment">WCA</abbr> will remain the same after you claim Universal Credit.</p>

<h3>Steps to making a claim</h3>

<ol class="steps">
<li>
<p>Set up an online Universal Credit account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete and submit online claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prove your identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide documents and evidence to support your claim.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>What you need to apply</h3>

<p>To apply online you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your bank, building society or credit union account details</li>
  <li>an email address</li>
  <li>access to a phone</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get support from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/help-to-claim/" rel="external">Citizens Advice Help to Claim service</a> (opens in new tab).</p>

<p>You’ll also have to prove your identity. You’ll need some identity documents for this, for example your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>driving licence</li>
  <li>passport</li>
  <li>debit or credit card</li>
  <li>payslip or P60</li>
</ul>

<p>To complete your claim you will need to provide information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your housing, for example how much rent you pay</li>
  <li>your earnings, for example payslips</li>
  <li>any disability or health condition that affects your work</li>
  <li>how much you pay for childcare if you want help with childcare costs</li>
  <li>your savings and any investments, like shares or a property that you rent out</li>
</ul>

<p>You might need an appointment with the Universal Credit team if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they need more information</li>
  <li>you cannot verify your identity online</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll be told if this appointment will be in a jobcentre or on the phone.</p>

<h3>Apply for Universal Credit online</h3>

<p><a class="gem-c-button govuk-button govuk-button--start" draggable="false" href="https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/start" role="button"> Start now <svg class="govuk-button__start-icon govuk-!-display-none-print" focusable="false" height="19" viewBox="0 0 33 40" width="17.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h13l20 20-20 20H0l20-20z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></a></p>

<h2>When you need to act</h2>

<p>To continue receiving financial support you must claim Universal Credit by the deadline date given in your letter. This is 3 months from the date the letter was sent out.</p>

<p>This gives you time to gather any information and evidence, such as identity documents that you need to make your claim.</p>

<p>It may take time to gather all your documents and evidence to make your claim online, so you need to act as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you cannot claim Universal Credit by the deadline date given on your letter, you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Universal Credit Migration Notice helpline</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We can only give you more time to make a claim if you have good reason. You must request this before&nbsp;the deadline date on your letter.</p>

<h2>How you’re paid</h2>

<p>Universal Credit is paid once a month, usually into your bank, building society or credit union account.</p>

<p>If you’re not able to open a bank, building society or credit union account, call the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Universal Credit Migration Notice helpline</a> to arrange a different way of getting paid.</p>

<p>Your payment can include an amount for housing costs, which you’ll usually need to pay to your landlord. If your landlord was being paid your housing costs directly, you will need to discuss the change of payment arrangements with them.</p>

<h3>Alternative Payment Arrangements (<abbr title="Alternative Payment Arrangements">APA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>If you’re having financial difficulties or you’re behind on your rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an Alternative Payment Arrangement (<abbr title="Alternative Payment Arrangements">APA</abbr>).</p>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, you could get an&nbsp;<abbr title="Alternative Payment Arrangements">APA</abbr>&nbsp;to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get your rent paid directly to your landlord</li>
  <li>get paid more frequently than once a month</li>
  <li>receive split payments, if you’re part of a couple</li>
</ul>

<p>You can apply for an <abbr title="Alternative Payment Arrangements">APA</abbr> through your Universal Credit online account once you’ve made your claim.</p>

<h3>Final payments for existing benefits</h3>

<p>The date of your final payments from your existing benefits depends on whichever is first of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the deadline date on your letter</li>
  <li>when you make a claim to Universal Credit</li>
</ul>

<p>If any further payments are due, they will be made shortly after your entitlement ends.</p>

<h3>Tax credits</h3>

<p>If you claim tax credits, your entitlement will end as soon as you make a claim to Universal Credit.</p>

<p>If you do not make a claim by the deadline, your tax credit entitlement will end on the day before the deadline.</p>

<h3>Other benefits</h3>

<p>The last payment dates are different if you receive the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (<abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>)</li>
  <li>income-related Employment and Support Allowance (<abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your entitlement to these benefits will continue for 2 weeks after you have made a claim to Universal Credit. This means you may receive payments from your existing benefits for another 2 weeks after you’ve made your claim. If any further payments are due, they will be made shortly after your entitlement ends.</p>

<p>If you do not make a claim to Universal Credit by the deadline, your last day of entitlement to your existing benefits will be 2 weeks after the deadline.</p>

<h3>Your first Universal Credit payment</h3>

<p>It usually takes around 5 weeks to get your first payment.</p>

<p>If you need help with your living costs while you wait for your first payment, you can apply for an advance within your Universal Credit online account.</p>

<h3>Payment dates</h3>

<p>After the first payment, you’ll be paid on the same date of every month.</p>

<p>If your payment date is on a weekend, you’ll be paid on the working day before.</p>

<p>You’ll get a monthly statement that tells you how much Universal Credit you’re going to get. You can view this in your online account.</p>

<p>Call the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Universal Credit Migration Notice helpline</a> straight away if your payment does not arrive on time.</p>

<h3>If you live with a partner</h3>

<p>If you both claim Universal Credit, you’ll get one payment each month for your household.</p>

<p>Phone the <a class="govuk-link" href="#contact-us">Universal Credit Migration Notice helpline</a> if you’re worried about getting access to this money.</p>

<h2>What you’ll get</h2>

<p>On Universal Credit, most people will be entitled to the same amount they received from their previous benefits, or more.</p>

<p>If the amount you are entitled to on your existing benefits is more than you will get on Universal Credit, a top up is available. This is called transitional protection.</p>

<p>You can only get this if you have received a Migration Notice letter and claim by the deadline date on your letter.</p>

<p>If your circumstances change before you make your claim, this may affect the amount you get.</p>

<p>You should claim as soon as possible to make sure the amount you are currently entitled to can be protected.</p>

<p>Any transitional protection you receive as part of your Universal Credit claim may stop if you have a change in circumstances once you’ve made your claim.</p>

<p>Your Universal Credit payment is made up of a standard allowance and any extra amounts that apply to you, for example if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have children</li>
  <li>have a disability or health condition which prevents you from working</li>
  <li>need help paying your rent</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefit calculators</h3>

<p>Use a benefits calculator to estimate how much you could get on Universal Credit.</p>

<p>These are free to use and anonymous.</p>

<p>The calculators do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any top up amount (transitional protection) that you may receive</li>
  <li>any deductions for a debt</li>
  <li>protection for people receiving tax credits with more than £16,000 in savings or capital</li>
</ul>

<p>If the calculation shows that you will receive less than your existing benefits, you may receive a top up. Any deductions will then be taken from your payments.</p>

<p>Use one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.entitledto.co.uk/benefits-calculator/startcalc.aspx?utm_source=BAdviser&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=GovUK" rel="external">entitledto</a> - for information on income-related benefits, tax credits, contribution-based benefits, Council Tax Reduction, Carer’s Allowance, Universal Credit and how your benefits will be affected if you start work</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/" rel="external">Turn2us</a> - for information on income-related benefits, tax credits, Council Tax Reduction, Carer’s Allowance, Universal Credit and how your benefits will be affected if you start work or change your working hours</li>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.betteroffcalculator.co.uk/#/free" rel="external">Policy in Practice</a> - for information on income-related benefits, tax credits, contribution-based benefits, Council Tax Reduction, Carer’s Allowance, Universal Credit, how these are calculated and how your benefits will be affected if you start work or change your working hours</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deductions</h3>

<p>Any existing benefit debts and some other debts will be deducted from your payments, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>utility debts (a minimal amount arranged with your provider to protect against being cut off)</li>
  <li>overpayments or arrears from Council Tax, Housing Benefit, <abbr title="Employment and Support Allowance">ESA</abbr> and <abbr title="Jobseeker's Allowance">JSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>court fines</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally the most that can be taken from your payment is 25% of your Universal Credit standard allowance. This is the basic amount you are entitled to, before money for things like childcare and housing costs are added.</p>

<h3>Earnings</h3>

<p>If you are working, how much Universal Credit you get will&nbsp;depend on your earnings. This includes income from working full time, part time, employed or self-employed.</p>

<p>Your circumstances are assessed every month. Changes in your circumstances can affect how much you’re paid for the whole assessment period - not just from the date you report them.</p>

<h2>Your responsibilities</h2>

<p>Your responsibilities will depend on your circumstances.</p>

<p>When you have made your claim to Universal Credit you will need to manage your own finances and maintain your claim online. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>updating your journal</li>
  <li>attending jobcentre appointments (if appropriate)</li>
  <li>managing your own rent and other housing costs</li>
  <li>reporting changes in circumstances</li>
</ul>

<p>A change in circumstance can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>finding or finishing a job</li>
  <li>having a child</li>
  <li>moving in with your partner</li>
  <li>starting to care for a child or disabled person</li>
  <li>changing your mobile number or email address</li>
  <li>moving to a new address</li>
  <li>changing your bank details</li>
  <li>your rent going up or down</li>
  <li>changes to your health condition</li>
  <li>becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach</li>
  <li>changes to your earnings (only if you’re self-employed)</li>
  <li>changes to your savings, investments and how much money you have</li>
  <li>changes to your immigration status, if you’re not a British citizen</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You could be taken to court or have to pay a penalty if you give wrong information or do not report a change in your circumstances.</p>
</div>

<h2>Other financial support</h2>

<p>If you’re in financial difficulties, you can get help and advice from the government, local councils, and other organisations.</p>

<p>If you receive Universal Credit, you may also be able to get other financial support depending on your circumstances.</p>

<h3>Advance and hardship payments</h3>

<p>If you do not have enough money while you wait for your first payment you can ask for an&nbsp;advance payment&nbsp;after you’ve made a claim. You do this through your online Universal Credit account.</p>

<p>You can also ask for a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or hygiene needs if you&nbsp;got a sanction.</p>

<p>You need to pay it back through your Universal Credit payments - they’ll be lower until you pay it back.</p>
