<p>Dear Dr Read,</p>

<p>I am writing firstly to thank you for the valuable work the Senior Salaries Review Body (<abbr title="Senior Salaries Review Body">SSRB</abbr>) provide and the observations made within the latest report regarding senior managers in the health and care sector.</p>

<p>The timing of the Spending Review announcement has unfortunately delayed the commencement of pay round 2021 to 2022. I am writing now to set out how the Department of Health and Social Care proposes working with the <abbr title="Senior Salaries Review Body">SSRB</abbr> in relation to the 2021 to 2022 pay round and to formally begin the Review Body process.</p>

<p>As you are aware, following the <abbr title="Senior Salaries Review Body">SSRB</abbr>’s 2020 report, its terms of reference have now been formally expanded to include all very senior managers (<abbr title="very senior managers">VSMs</abbr>) within the NHS and executive and senior managers (<abbr title="executive and senior managers">ESMs</abbr>) within the Department of Health and Social Care’s arm’s length bodies (<abbr title="arm's length bodies">ALBs</abbr>).</p>

<p>As this is the first year of the <abbr title="Senior Salaries Review Body">SSRB</abbr>’s expanded remit group, I am asking you to build on the work of the previous round and to use your expertise across senior public sector pay more broadly to make observations on the current levels of <abbr title="very senior manager">VSM</abbr> and <abbr title="executive and senior manager">ESM</abbr> pay. I hope this will then form a baseline for pay recommendations in future years.</p>

<p>You will have seen that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that pay rises in the public sector will be restrained and targeted in 2021 to 2022 at the Spending Review. As the Chancellor set out, COVID-19 is significantly impacting the economy, labour market and the fiscal position and has supressed earnings growth and increased redundancies in the private sector.</p>

<p>HM Treasury will set out the fiscal and economic context in more detail as the round progresses and it is within this context that I request your observations are made when considering what appropriate levels of pay are for senior managers in the health and care sector along with what is needed to recruit, retain and motivate the senior manager workforce and what represents value for the taxpayer.</p>

<p>It is important to state that although I am not seeking a pay recommendation for this group for the year 2021 to 2022, this work will play a key role in positioning senior health manager pay for future years.</p>

<p>We are hoping to expediate the process as much as possible this year and would welcome your report in early May 2021.</p>

<p>Yours ever,</p>

<p>Matt Hancock<br>
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</p>
