<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> What Evusheld is and what it is used for</h2>

<p>Evusheld is made up of two active substances tixagevimab and cilgavimab. These are both medicines called antiviral monoclonal antibodies. They work specifically against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They prevent the virus from entering human cells.</p>

<p>Evusheld is used to help prevent COVID 19 infection in adults who are not currently infected with COVID-19 and who have not been recently in contact with someone who has COVID-19 when they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are unlikely to be protected by a COVID-19 vaccine</li>
  <li>or when vaccination is not recommended</li>
</ul>

<p>Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> What you need to know before you take Paxlovid</h2>

<h3>This medicine must not be given if:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>you are allergic to tixagevimab, cilgavimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings and precautions</h3>

<p>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Evusheld if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have low numbers of blood platelets (which help blood clotting), any blood clotting problems or are taking a medicine to prevent blood clots (an anticoagulant)</li>
  <li>you have had a heart attack or stroke, have other heart problems, or are at high-risk of cardiac (heart) problems or blood clots</li>
</ul>

<p>Tell a doctor, pharmacist or nurse or get medical help immediately if you notice any signs of a serious allergic reaction, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>difficulty breathing or swallowing</li>
  <li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat</li>
  <li>severe itching of the skin, with a red rash or raised bumps</li>
</ul>

<h3>Driving and using machines</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> How Evusheld is given</h2>

<p>Evusheld will be given to as two injections one after the other into a muscle (usually one injection into each of your buttocks).</p>

<p>The injections will be administered by a doctor or nurse in a healthcare setting. You will be observed for at least 1 hour after getting the injections.</p>

<p>The recommended dose for prevention of COVID-19 is 300 mg, given as two injections:
* 150 mg of tixagevimab

<p>The recommended dose for prevention of some variants of COVID-19 is 600 mg, given as two injections:

<p>Your doctor will decide what dose you need and if you need to receive additional doses of Evusheld for ongoing protection.</p>
