<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>What is a trigger event?</h2>

<p>A trigger event is an event that will have a significant impact on the trade of your pub and meets certain <strong>conditions</strong> set out in the Pubs Code.</p>

<p>It entitles you to ask your pub-owning business (POB) for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Rent Assessment - which begins with a Rent Assessment Proposal (RAP) for a new tied rent; and/or</li>
  <li>A Market Rent Only (MRO) option to rent your pub on a free-of-tie basis.</li>
</ul>

<p>A trigger event is one of four gateways to request a MRO option (called ‘MRO events’). You can find out more about the other MRO events <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/market-rent-only-mro-rights">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>What are the conditions for a trigger event?</h2>

<h4>See Pubs Code - Regulation 7</h4>

<p><strong>The event must either affect:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Only your pub; or</li>
  <li>Other pubs in the local area but be unlikely to affect all pubs in England and Wales.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the event affects other pubs in the local area, it must directly relate to a change in the tie that the POB has imposed on the pub or have an effect which is directly related to local area changes. These might be changes to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local infrastructure</li>
  <li>Local employment</li>
  <li>Long-term changes to the local economic environment</li>
  <li>Local environmental factors</li>
</ul>

<p>The trigger event <strong>must also meet all the following tests</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It results in a decrease in the trade that your pub could reasonably be expected to achieve each month for a continuous 12-month period</li>
  <li>It was not reasonably foreseeable when the tenancy was granted, or when any rent assessment (or money payable instead of rent) was last concluded</li>
  <li>It is beyond your control and not an event you could have reasonably prevented, or substantially mitigated the effect of.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It cannot be an event that is</strong>:</p>

<p>Connected to your personal circumstances (for example your health, your family or your relationships).</p>

<p>Related to an increase in the price at which a tied product or service is supplied to you due to circumstances beyond the POB’s control, such as an increase in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the price at which the POB buys the product or service</li>
  <li>the tax or duty it has to pay because of buying the product or service</li>
  <li>any other tax or regulatory cost that the POB has to pay which affects its costs</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the other MRO events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a significant increase in the price at which a tied product or service is supplied to you (which also gives you the right to request a rent assessment)</li>
  <li>a tenancy renewal</li>
  <li>the receipt of a RAP</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>I think there has been a trigger event - what do I need to do?</h2>

<h4>See Pubs Code - Regulations 19 and 25</h4>

<p>There are a number of steps you must take if you think there has been a trigger event.</p>

<p>To show there has been a trigger event you must first send your POB a written analysis of the forecasted level of trading of your pub. This forecast must cover a period of at least the next 12 months. This is your <strong>relevant analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>There are <strong>strict deadlines</strong> that apply to many Pubs Code processes. Please refer to the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pubs-code-factsheets">factsheets</a> on Rent Assessments or the MRO option for information on the trigger event timescales. Tenants are strongly advised to seek independent advice from a qualified professional when considering and preparing a relevant analysis.</p>

<p>If you and the POB disagree that you are entitled to a Rent Assessment or the MRO option, you can make an <strong>arbitration referral</strong> within strict time limits. Please see the relevant <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/pubs-code-factsheets">factsheets</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Worked example</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your pub is located near a large factory and much of your trade is from its employees coming in for drinks after work. Unexpectedly, the manufacturer which owns the factory announces that it will be closing the site and moving its operations. You are concerned as you think this will impact on your business. This was not something you could have known about when taking on the tenancy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The closure of the factory is a change in the local area, which may impact either your pub or other local pubs. You may want to consider whether the closure of the factory is a trigger event under the Pubs Code. If it is, you may be entitled to have your rent reconsidered by asking for a RAP, or to be given the option of a MRO tenancy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The factory closure may entitle you to request a RAP or MRO option if trade will be down on what you expected for at least the 12 months after the closure. You can demonstrate that by sending an analysis to your POB of the forecast level which demonstrates a decrease in trade in each of the next 12 months after the factory closure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to send that analysis to the POB within <strong>56 days</strong> after the factory closes. You will then have <strong>21 days</strong> after sending the analysis to request a MRO option and <strong>14 days</strong> after sending the analysis to request a RAP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You should consider whether there is anything you can reasonably do to substantially lessen the effect of the closure on your business.</strong> If there is, then the closure may not count as a trigger event.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
