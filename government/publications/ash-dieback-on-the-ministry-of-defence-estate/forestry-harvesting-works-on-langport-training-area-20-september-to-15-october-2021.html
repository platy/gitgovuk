<p>Some important forestry harvesting work will take place on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Training Estate at Langport Training Area between Monday 20 September and Friday 15 October inclusive, including weekends.</p>

<h2>Why we are carrying out the work</h2>

<p>The work is essential to improve the safety of the woodlands for military training, and for members of the public using the area for recreational activities, by removing dead and dying trees infected with Ash Dieback. Ash Dieback is a serious fungal disease of ash trees. There is no cure or treatment for the disease and over time infected trees will weaken, causing branches to fall and trees to eventually collapse and die, presenting a significant health and safety risk.</p>

<p>Whilst we are there, we will also be taking the opportunity to thin some of the woodland compartments and repair the access tracks. Thinning is when we remove some of the smaller and poorer quality trees, allowing those that remain to have more space and light to grow. It also opens up the tree canopy to allow more light to reach the forest floor to encourage the growth of woodland plants.</p>

<h2>Contractor access and vehicle movements</h2>

<p>Contractors will be accessing the woodlands through Mildmays Road, which will also be used periodically during this time by timber lorries. We therefore politely request that all residents avoid parking at this access point or on the junction at the end of Mildmays Road whilst the work is taking place. Parts of the woodlands will be closed to the public whilst the work is ongoing, which will include weekends, so the observance of all safety signage is extremely important.</p>

<h2>Your safety</h2>

<p>For everyone’s safety, it is important that any visitors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep to the public rights of way</li>
  <li>adhere to all safety signs and do not cross tape barriers or climb on timber stacks; access through work sites will be prohibited</li>
  <li>keep dogs on leads and supervise children at all times</li>
  <li>do not approach working machinery or moving lorries and vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keeping residents informed</h2>

<p>We would appreciate any help you can give to inform local residents about this important work, please feel free to circulate the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018233/Forestry_work_in_progress_-_Langport_Training_Area.pdf" rel="external">Langport Training Area forestry notice</a>.</p>

<p>The work is being undertaken through the approved Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO)’s Forestry Management Plan, which has been compiled with the approval and consent of Natural England and the Forestry Commission.</p>

<p>We will ensure that we carry this work out with the minimum of disturbance but if residents have any questions or concerns, they can contact a member of the forestry team:</p>
