<h2 id="about-this-guide">
<span class="number">1. </span>About this guide</h2>

<p>This is one of several guides that give detailed information about social security benefits.</p>

<p>It is intended for professional advisers and members of the public who want to know more about benefits for people who are disabled as a result of injuries or diseases arising from work.</p>

<h3 id="this-guide-and-the-law">
<span class="number">1.1 </span>This guide and the law</h3>

<p>The guide gives a detailed explanation about benefits for people who are disabled as a result of accidents or diseases arising from work. It cannot cover every situation or problem, or provide a full interpretation of the rules in all cases. So it must not be treated as a complete and authoritative statement of the law.</p>

<p>The basis of the law for these benefits is contained in the Social Security Act 1998, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Social Security Administration Act 1992. These Acts provide the framework for the detailed rules contained in regulations and orders made by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament.</p>

<p>In the text there are references to the relevant Acts, Regulations or Schedules to allow you to consult the legislation. These documents are listed in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#further-information">further information</a> which tells you where you can consult them.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-the-industrial-injuries-scheme">
<span class="number">2. </span>Introduction to the Industrial Injuries Scheme</h2>

<p>The Industrial Injuries Scheme provides non-contributory no-fault benefits for disablement because of an accident at work, or because of one of over 70 prescribed diseases known to be a risk from certain jobs. The scheme also covers people working on approved employment training schemes or courses. (See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#appendix-1-list-of-diseases-covered-by-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">Appendix 1</a> for a list of the prescribed diseases.) The benefits payable under the scheme are known as Industrial Injuries Scheme Benefits (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Scheme Benefits">IISB</abbr>).</p>

<p>Benefits are paid to employees who were employed earners at the time of the accident or when they contracted a prescribed disease, or to people who were working on an approved employment training scheme or course. (Legislation (1) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 2(1)(a))</p>

<p>Accidents or diseases which arise out of self-employment or service in HM forces are not included in the scheme. (Legislation (2) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 2(1)(b)) (Legislation (3) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 115)</p>

<p>The Home Office has a similar scheme for prisoners.</p>

<p>All Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefits, except Industrial Death Benefit, are tax free.</p>

<p>They are payable in addition to other incapacity and disability benefits but taken into account against income-related benefits.</p>

<p>The Industrial Injuries Scheme Benefits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</li>
  <li>Constant Attendance Allowance</li>
  <li>Exceptionally Severe Disablement Allowance</li>
  <li>Reduced Earnings Allowance</li>
  <li>Retirement Allowance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-you-cannot-act-for-yourself">
<span class="number">2.1 </span>If you cannot act for yourself</h3>
<p>If you wish to claim for any of these benefits but you are unable to act for yourself because of physical or mental incapacity, the Secretary of State can appoint someone to act on your behalf. If this happens, the person appointed is responsible for dealing with all your social security affairs, including claiming and receiving benefits. They are also responsible for notifying any changes of circumstances which may affect your benefit. (Legislation (4) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 33)</p>

<p>If you are able to handle your own affairs but want someone else to collect your benefit for you regularly, you may be able to make arrangements with your bank, building society or the Post Office®. Please ask them to help you with this. (Legislation (5) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 20A(4)(b))</p>

<h3 id="if-someone-who-was-disabled-because-of-an-accident-at-work-or-a-prescribed-disease-dies">
<span class="number">2.2 </span>If someone who was disabled because of an accident at work or a prescribed disease dies</h3>

<p>If someone who has not claimed Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit dies, but they would have qualified for this benefit, a claim can be made on their behalf, for example by a widow or surviving civil partner. (Legislation (6) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 30(5))</p>

<p>If someone who has claimed Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit dies, any outstanding benefit can be paid to a third party, for example an executor or next of kin. (Legislation (7) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 30(2))</p>

<h2 id="industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">
<span class="number">3. </span>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</h2>

<h3 id="eligibility">
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Eligibility</h3>

<p>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is a weekly benefit paid to people who become disabled because of an accident at work or due to certain prescribed diseases caused by their job, or whilst working on an approved employment training scheme or course. 
See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#appendix-1-list-of-diseases-covered-by-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">Appendix 1</a> for a list of prescribed diseases.</p>

<p>The amount you get depends on how badly you are disabled as a result of the industrial injury or disease.</p>

<h4 id="employed-earners-employment">Employed earner’s employment</h4>

<p>Only employed earners, or people who can be treated as employed earners, are covered by the Industrial Injuries Scheme, or people who were on an approved employment training scheme or course when the accident or event happened. (Legislation (8) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 94 –accidents) (Legislation (9) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 108 –prescribed diseases)</p>

<p>An employed earner is a person who is gainfully employed in Great Britain either under a contract of service or is an office holder (for example, a company director). (Legislation (10) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 2(1)(a))</p>

<p>Some people who are not employed earners are treated as though they were for the purposes of the scheme, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special constables, who are not paid and so cannot be said to be working for reward</li>
  <li>agency staff who are self-employed under a contract for services but are still liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance (<abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr>) contributions in respect of their earnings. Legislation (11) - SS (Employed Earners Employment for Industrial Injuries Purposes) Regs 1975 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 1 Part 1 & <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 3)</li>
  <li>people who were on an approved employment training scheme or course when the accident or event happened</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-claim-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>How to claim Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</h3>

<p>You do not need to have paid any <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> contributions in order to claim Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.</p>

<p>If your accident or disease is caused by self-employed work or employment not treated as employed earner’s employment, you are not covered by the scheme.</p>

<p>You cannot get industrial injuries benefits for accidents which occur or diseases contracted while serving in HM forces. You may be able to get compensation through the War Pensions Scheme or Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. (Legislation (12) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 115(2))</p>

<p>If you are not sure whether you are covered you can contact Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre on 0800 121 8379.</p>

<p>The decision maker will give an informal opinion on employed earner’s employment and if it is accepted that the employment is as an employed earner no further question on employment status arises.</p>

<p>If it is not accepted that the employment is as an employed earner, any claim to benefit will be disallowed. If you dispute a disallowance, your papers will be sent to the Inland Revenue for a formal decision on employed earner’s employment.</p>

<h4 id="residence-in-great-britain">Residence in Great Britain</h4>

<p>You must normally have had the accident or got the disease in Great Britain, but you may still get benefit if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you were a mariner, airman, worked on the continental shelf of the United Kingdom, or worked in another European Union (EU) country or Norway (Legislation (13) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 117) (Legislation (14) - SSB (PA) Regs 1975 reg 10c & 11)</li>
  <li>your employer was paying Class 1 <abbr title="National Insurance">NI</abbr> contributions for you while you (Legislation (15) - SS Contributions Regs 1979 reg 120) were working out of the country</li>
  <li>you were paying special Class 2 contributions as a volunteer (Legislation (16) - SSB (PA) Regs 1975 reg 10(c)5 & 6) development worker</li>
  <li>you worked in one of the countries with which Great Britain has an agreement covering industrial injuries</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="obtaining-a-claim-form">Obtaining a claim form</h4>

<p>Obtain a claim form from Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre. They can be contacted on 0800 121 8379. You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/how-to-claim">download the forms</a> from the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit guide.</p>

<p>The claim packs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BI 100A, Industrial Accidents</li>
  <li>BI 100PD, Prescribed Industrial Diseases</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="when-to-claim">When to claim</h4>

<p>If you think you have a disease caused by your job or whilst working on an approved employment training scheme or course claim Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit straight away.</p>

<p>If you have an accident, claim 2 months after the accident. This is because you cannot get benefit for the first 15 weeks (90 days not including Sundays) after your accident and you will not normally be medically examined until after this time.</p>

<p>If you have any relevant medical evidence, or a copy of your accident report, send it with your claim form but do not delay claiming by trying to get a fresh report.</p>

<p>Do not delay claiming. If you do you may lose some benefits. This is because Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a period more than 3 months before the date of your claim (Legislation (17) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 19(1) & <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 4)</li>
  <li>more than 1 month before the date of claim, if you are already receiving Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for other accidents or diseases. (Legislation (18) - SS&CS (D&A) Regs 1999 reg 7(2))</li>
  <li>different rules apply to claims for occupational deafness - you cannot get benefit for any period before the date of claim, see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#prescribed-diseases">‘Prescribed diseases’</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The date of your claim is the date your fully completed claim form is received by an office of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. It is very important that you fill in all the details on the form carefully and return it to us as soon as possible. Details of where to send your claim form are in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/how-to-claim">BI100A Notes</a>. (Legislation (19) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 6)</p>

<p>If you want help filling in your claim form, contact Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre on 0800 121 8379.</p>

<h2 id="industrial-accidents">
<span class="number">4. </span>Industrial accidents</h2>

<p>An ‘accident’ for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit purposes means any unintended happening or incident at work that has arisen out of and in the course of your employment, or whilst on an approved employment training scheme or course and has resulted in a personal injury.</p>

<p>It must have arisen from employed earner’s employment, or whilst on an approved employment training scheme or course. (Legislation (20) - SS Act 1998 sec 29 6(b))</p>

<p>You can only get benefit if the accident results in personal injury (also described as loss of faculty). It does not matter if the effect of the injury is immediate (for example, if you break your leg in a fall) or is delayed (for example, a blow to the knee which leads to impaired mobility at a later time). Generally an accident which happens when you are at work is accepted as having happened as a result of your work, unless there is some evidence that this is not so. Whether or not you are considered to be at work at a particular time depends on the circumstances in each case. For example, you cannot normally be regarded as being at work when you are travelling to or from work, but you may be if you are in transport provided by your employer. (Legislation (21) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 99)</p>

<p>An accident can be treated as having happened when you were at work and as a result of your work if it occurred in any of the situations below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>because you were doing something you were employed to do</li>
  <li>because your work put you at special risk</li>
  <li>while you were helping in an emergency, for instance in rescue work at any premises used for your employer’s business. (Legislation (22) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 100)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were doing something which your employer does not allow you to do, or the rules for your job do not allow you to do, the accident may still be treated as having happened during, and as a result of your work, if what you were doing was done for the purpose of your employer’s business and was within the scope of your job.</p>

<p>In some other unusual cases, such as ‘skylarking’ by workmates, an accident can be covered if it happens through no fault of your own while you are at work.</p>

<h3 id="making-a-benefit-claim-for-an-industrial-accident">
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Making a benefit claim for an industrial accident</h3>

<h4 id="when-to-claim-1">When to claim</h4>

<p>Do not delay in making a claim if you think you may be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit as a result of your accident.</p>

<p>If you have any relevant medical evidence send it with your claim form but do not delay claiming by trying to get a fresh report.</p>

<p>Do not delay claiming. If you do you may lose some benefits. This is because Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a period more than 3 months before the date of your claim</li>
  <li>if you are already in receipt of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for other accidents or diseases, more than 1 month before the date of claim (Legislation (27) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 19(1) & <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 4)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-claim">How to claim</h4>

<p>Obtain a claim form BI100A from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/further-information">Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/how-to-claim">download the forms</a> from the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit guide.</p>

<p>The date of your claim is the date your fully completed claim form is received in an office of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. It is very important that you carefully fill in all the details on the form and return it to us as soon as possible. Details of where to send your claim form are in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/how-to-claim">BI100 Notes</a>. (Legislation (28) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 6)</p>

<p>Once we have received your application, you will be sent a written acknowledgement. They will normally write to your employer/training scheme provider to verify the accident.</p>

<p>Confirmation is needed of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the time, date and place of the accident</li>
  <li>that the accident arose out of and in the course of your employment or whilst on an approved employment training scheme or course</li>
  <li>that your employment was employed earner’s employment or on an approved employment training scheme or course</li>
  <li>that the employment was in Great Britain or was covered by special provisions</li>
</ul>

<p>The accident must have happened in the course of your employment while you were doing anything which: (Legislation (25) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 94–101)</p>

<ul>
  <li>you were authorised, expressly or by implication, to do by your employer</li>
  <li>was so closely related to your employment that it was reasonable for you to be doing it</li>
  <li>is covered by the special provisions regarding actions in an emergency, transport provided by the employer, breach of the rules or accident caused by another person’s behaviour</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the decision maker has accepted that you have suffered an industrial accident, you will then be asked to attend a medical examination. (Legislation (29) - SS Act 1998 sec 19(1))</p>

<p>If you are asked to attend a medical examination and you fail to turn up without good cause, your claim will be disallowed. (Legislation (30) - SS Act 1998 sec 19(3))</p>

<h4 id="about-the-medical-examination">About the medical examination</h4>

<p>Your medical examination will be carried out by 1 or possibly 2 experienced medical practitioners.</p>

<p>These doctors are specially trained in industrial injuries disablement matters.</p>

<p>If you can travel, you will be told when and where to go for the examination. You will be told what out-of-pocket expenses you can claim. If you are not fit to travel alone, someone can travel with you. (Legislation (31) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 26)</p>

<p>If you are not fit to travel, you can also request an examination at home. You should give full details of why you are unable to attend at a Medical Boarding Centre.</p>

<p>The medical examination will be held in private but you may be able to take a companion if the doctor allows it. Occasionally you may be asked if an observer can be present.</p>

<p>You can give the doctor any evidence which was not included with your claim form, if you think it will help them to give an opinion on your disablement.</p>

<p>If you have attended a hospital following an industrial accident, the doctor may seek further information from the hospital. Hospital case notes may be requested by the doctor to assist in giving an opinion.</p>

<p>The doctor could also ask for a report from your <abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The doctor will take a statement from you and send a written report to the decision maker based upon the examination and any other medical evidence. The doctor will give an opinion on whether you have suffered a loss of faculty as a result of the accident and, if so, advise on the level of your disablement and how long it is expected to last. The doctor will also provide an explanation for the decision maker about how they arrived at that opinion.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-loss-of-faculty">What is a loss of faculty?</h4>

<p>Loss of physical or mental faculty means some loss of power or function of an organ of the body. Loss of faculty can include disfigurement even when this causes no bodily handicap. Whether a loss of faculty results in disability is decided by comparing your condition as a result of the accident with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex. (Legislation (32) - Commissioners Decisions R(I)7/67 and R(I)1/81)</p>

<h4 id="degree-of-disablement">Degree of disablement</h4>

<p>Your disablement is assessed as a percentage up to 100%.</p>

<p>The degree of disablement for certain defined injuries is laid down in the Regulations. For example, for serious disablement such as loss of both hands or loss of sight the degree of disablement is 100%, for the loss of one hand it is normally 60%, and for the loss of an index finger it is usually 14%. The percentages listed in Regulations for different disablements is in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#appendix-2-prescribed-degrees-of-disablement">Appendix 2</a>. (Legislation (33) - SS (Gen Ben) Regs 1982 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 2)</p>

<p>The degree of disablement for injuries not listed in the Regulations is arrived at by comparing them with these standards.</p>

<p>The medical advice or assessment takes account of all disabilities resulting from the industrial accident. Where your disability also results from some other cause which arose before the accident, the degree of disablement which would in any event be present due to that other cause is not counted, but the interaction between the 2 causes is included in the assessment.</p>

<p>For example, a miner who has had considerable trouble with his back for many years and who is known to have lumbar spondylosis, injures his back lifting a heavy weight at work.</p>

<p>The doctor considers a gross assessment of disablement for injury to the spine and deducts an amount for the disablement already present due to the earlier back problems. (Legislation (34) - SS (Gen Ben) Regs 1982 reg 11)</p>

<p>If your disablement is 11% or more, and some other condition arises after the accident but is not directly caused by it, any increase in your disablement due to the accident as a result of that other cause is also used to work out your disablement.</p>

<p>For example, a man fractured his left forearm in a fall at work. After the industrial accident he was involved in a traffic accident and fractured his left collar bone.</p>

<p>The doctor considers an assessment of disablement for injury to the forearm and if that assessment is over 11% the doctor adds a further assessment for the extent that the later fracture increases the man’s disability.</p>

<p>You may be given a ‘final’ assessment of disablement for life if your disability is assessed as permanent and is unlikely to change. Or where you are likely to make a full recovery the assessment may be final but for a limited period. Or you may be given a provisional assessment for a limited period at the end of which you will be re-examined and your disablement assessed again. (Legislation (35) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 6(2))</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-on-your-claim">
<span class="number">4.2 </span>The decision on your claim</h3>

<p>After the medical examination, your claim will be decided by a decision maker. The decision maker will look at the doctor’s advice and any other available evidence.</p>

<p>We will write to tell you the decision on your claim, the amount of any benefit you will get and the period for which you will receive benefit.</p>

<p>The decision only takes account of your physical or mental condition. Basic Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is not affected by what type of job you do or any loss of earnings. It can be paid whether or not you have returned to work and it does not depend on your earnings.</p>

<p>Loss of earnings and other circumstances may, however, mean you can get one or more of the other benefits described later in this guide.</p>

<span class="number">4.3 </span>Payment of benefit</h3>

<h4 id="how-much-benefit-you-will-get">How much benefit you will get</h4>

<p>The amount of benefit you get depends on how badly you are disabled by the accident.</p>

<p>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be paid for the first 15 weeks (90 days not including Sundays) after the date of your accident. (Legislation (36) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(6))</p>

<p>You will not get benefit if your disablement is assessed at less than 14%. (Legislation (37) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(1))</p>

<p>But you may be able to get benefit if you have had more than one accident or disease and the total disablement, when the effects of all the accidents and diseases are added together, is 14% or more. This is known as aggregation. (Legislation (38) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(2))</p>

<p>If your disablement is at least 14% your benefit will be paid as a weekly pension.</p>

<p>If your disablement is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between 14% and 19% you will get a pension at the 20% rate</li>
  <li>20% or over it will be rounded up or down to the nearest 10%. (Legislation (39) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(3))</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-you-are-paid">How you are paid</h4>

<p>Our policy is to pay all benefits directly into an account.</p>

<p>This is the safest way to pay you and lets you choose how and when you get your money. You can use a bank or building society.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a cash machine, which will usually mean you can get your money at any time of the day or night.</p>

<p>There are arrangements with banks and building societies so that you can collect cash from some of their accounts at your Post Office® branch.</p>

<p>The Post Office® also provides a bank account that we can pay benefits into. With this account you can only collect your money in cash from Post Office® branches.</p>

<p>The other advantages of having your money paid into an account are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can get your money from many different places</li>
  <li>from some accounts you could have regular bills paid - this could save you money, but you will need to make sure that there is enough money in your account to pay the bills, if not, you may be charged a fee</li>
  <li>using an account may help you save</li>
</ul>

<p>The account can be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>the name of your partner - we use partner to mean a person you are married to or a person you live with as if you were married to them, or a civil partner or a person you live with as if you are civil partners</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and your partner</li>
  <li>the name of the person acting on your behalf</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and the person acting on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefit is paid either every 4 weeks, every 13 weeks or every week.</p>

<p>If you have a bank or building society account but you do not wish to use it, for example a joint account, any bank or building society will help you open an account that suits you better. Remember to ask whether their accounts allow you to get your money from the Post Office®, if this is important to you.</p>

<h4 id="basic-bank-account">Basic bank account</h4>

<p>If you have had problems opening a current account, or if you are worried about being overdrawn, you could ask any bank or building society about opening a basic bank account.</p>

<p>These are sometimes called introductory or starter accounts and are available from all major banks.</p>

<p>These accounts offer free banking but overdrafts are not available.</p>

<p>You can use these accounts to pay money in, pay bills automatically and get cash out.</p>

<p>Many basic bank accounts also allow you to get cash from Post Offices®.</p>

<h4 id="if-your-circumstances-change">If your circumstances change</h4>

<p>A decision can be looked at again at any time if your condition has changed.</p>

<p>If the condition improves you must tell us straight away.</p>

<p>If you feel your condition has got worse and you want us to have another look at the decision, complete and return form BI168, which you can get from Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre.</p>

<p>If you are receiving Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit you must also tell us if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marry, remarry or form a civil partnership and change your name</li>
  <li>change your address</li>
  <li>leave the country</li>
  <li>go into prison</li>
</ul>

<p>(Legislation (40) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 32)</p>

<h4 id="if-you-leave-the-country">If you leave the country</h4>

<p>If you leave the country, Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is payable while you are away.</p>

(Legislation (41) - SSB (PA) Regs 1975 reg 9)</p>

<p>If you intend to be away for more than 3 months, payment of your benefit will be made by the International Pensions Centre (<abbr title="International Pensions Centre">IPC</abbr>).</p>

<p>You will be asked how you want your payments to be made while you are away. You can choose between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct Payment to a United Kingdom (UK) bank or building society account every 4 or 13 weeks</li>
  <li>payable orders sent directly to you every 4 or 13 weeks while you are away</li>
  <li>Transcontinental Automated Payments (<abbr title="Transcontinental Automated Payments">TAPS</abbr>), if the country has this arrangement with Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>payment to a nominee</li>
  <li>payment when you return to the UK</li>
</ul>

<p>You must let us know when you return to the UK.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-go-to-prison">If you go to prison</h4>

<p>If you go into prison, you must let us know the date you were admitted.</p>

<p>Payment of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is suspended during any period of imprisonment.</p>

<p>When you are released let us know the date. Arrears of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit may be paid for the period of imprisonment subject to a maximum of one year’s benefit. (Legislation (42) - SS (Gen Ben) Regs 1987 reg 2(6) & 2(7))</p>

<h4 id="if-you-die">If you die</h4>

<p>If you die, someone should let us know straight away.</p>

<h3 id="effects-of-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit-on-other-benefits">
<span class="number">4.4 </span>Effects of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit on other benefits</h3>

<p>Your basic Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit does not affect any other National Insurance benefits such as:</p>

  <li>Incapacity Benefit</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (contribution-based)</li>
  <li>Contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Retirement Pension</li>

  <li>Income Support</li>
  <li>Employment and Support Allowance (income-related)</li>
  <li>Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance</li>
  <li>Pension Credit</li>
  <li>Housing Benefit</li>
  <li>Working Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Child Tax Credit</li>
  <li>Universal Credit</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You will have to contact your local authority to confirm if any reduction you or your partner receive in your council tax bill is affected.</p>

<p>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit may also affect how much War Pension you get, if you are entitled to both.</p>

<h2 id="prescribed-diseases">
<span class="number">5. </span>Prescribed diseases</h2>

<h3 id="introduction">
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Introduction</h3>

<p>The law provides for payment of benefits to people who are suffering from certain diseases contracted in the course of certain types of employment or whilst working on an approved employment training scheme or course. These diseases are referred to as prescribed diseases (<abbr title="prescribed diseases">PDs</abbr>) and are listed in Regulations. (Legislation (43) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 108(1)) (Legislation (44) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 1)</p>

<p>A disease or injury is prescribed when it is a risk arising from a person’s occupation and not a risk common to everybody.  The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (<abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr>) makes recommendations to the Secretary of State on what diseases the Industrial Injuries Scheme covers. (Legislation (45) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 108(2))</p>

<p><abbr title="Industrial Injuries Advisory Council">IIAC</abbr> will only recommend that a disease be added to the list of diseases covered if it finds that the disease is a risk of nature of the occupation. There is no entitlement to benefit in respect of a disease if it is not listed in the Regulations, or if the person’s job is not listed against the particular disease. But there may be entitlement to benefit under the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#industrial-accidents">industrial accident</a> provisions if a disease has been caused as a result of an accident.</p>

<p>If you are told that you are not entitled to benefit for a certain disease, it does not necessarily mean you do not have the disease for which you claimed. What you are being told is that you do not meet the criteria laid down in law for receiving benefit for that disease.</p>

<p>For example, a coal miner may be refused benefit for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-<abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> even though he has the disease. However, unless his actual work history satisfied the occupational criteria set out in regulations, he will not be entitled to benefit.</p>

<p>This is especially important for diseases common in the population at large, where some workers would have got the disease whatever job they did.</p>

<h3 id="which-diseases-are-prescribed">
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Which diseases are prescribed</h3>

<p>Prescribed diseases are grouped according to their causes. There are four groups of causes, each identified by a letter, and each prescribed disease has a number. The groups are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A for a physical cause</li>
  <li>B for a biological cause</li>
  <li>C for a chemical cause</li>
  <li>D for any other cause</li>
</ul>

<p>A full list of the prescribed diseases and types of occupation which are covered by the scheme is set out in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#appendix-1-list-of-diseases-covered-by-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">Appendix 1</a>. (Legislation (47) - SS(II) (PD) Regs 1985 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 1)</p>

<h3 id="questions-arising-on-a-prescribed-diseases-claim">
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Questions arising on a prescribed diseases claim</h3>

<p>The primary questions arising on a prescribed disease claim are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is the disease a prescribed disease?</li>
  <li>is the disease prescribed in relation to your occupation and work history - this involves considering whether your employment could have caused the disease, and whether the employment was employed earner’s employment or was whilst on an approved employment training scheme or course?</li>
  <li>are you suffering from the disease, or have you suffered from the disease - this is called the diagnosis question?</li>
  <li>is the disease due to the nature of your employment or the nature of your approved training scheme or course?</li>
  <li>when was the date of onset of the disease?</li>
  <li>have you suffered a relevant loss of faculty due to the disease?</li>
</ul>

<span class="number">5.4 </span>Making a benefit claim for a prescribed disease</h3>

<h4 id="when-to-claim-2">When to claim</h4>

<p>You can make a claim at any time on or after the date you think you contracted the prescribed disease.</p>

<p>If you have any relevant medical evidence send it with your claim form but do not delay claiming by trying to get a fresh report.</p>

<p>Do not delay claiming. If you do you may lose some benefits. This is because Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for a period more than 3 months before the date of your claim</li>
  <li>if you are already in receipt of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for other accidents or diseases, more than 1 month before the date of claim. (Legislation (51) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 19(1) & <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 4)</li>

<p>You will be sent a written acknowledgement that the claim form has been received.</p>

<p>We may have to contact your employer(s)/training scheme provider to confirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your periods of employment</li>
  <li>that your employment was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefits-technical-guidance#employed-earners-employment">employed earner’s employment</a> or on an approved employment training scheme or course</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="if-you-satisfy-the-prescription-question">If you satisfy the prescription question</h4>

<p>Your papers will be referred to medical services and you may be asked to attend a medical examination. (Legislation (52) - SS Act 1998 sec 19(1))</p>

<p>If you are asked to attend a medical examination and you fail to turn up without good cause, your claim will be disallowed. (Legislation (53) - SS Act 1998 sec 19(3))</p>

<h4 id="if-you-do-not-satisfy-the-prescription-question">If you do not satisfy the prescription question</h4>

<p>Your claim will be disallowed and we will write to tell you this.</p>

<h4 id="fast-track-cases">Fast track cases</h4>

<p>Claims for prescribed disease D3 and for all other diseases where the person is terminally ill, are treated as fast track cases. These cases are given priority at all times.</p>

<h4 id="specific-criteria">Specific criteria</h4>

<p>Details of the diseases and the qualifying conditions can be found at Appendix 1</p>

<h4 id="about-the-medical-examination-1">About the medical examination</h4>

<p>Your medical examination will be carried out by one or possibly two experienced medical practitioners. These doctors are specially trained in industrial injuries disablement matters.</p>

<p>If you can travel, you will be told when and where to go for the examination. You will be told what out-of-pocket expenses you can claim. If you are not fit to travel alone, someone can travel with you. If you are not fit to travel, you can also request an examination at home but you should give full details of why you are unable to attend a Medical Boarding Centre.</p>

<p>The medical examination will be held in private but you may be able to take a companion if the doctor allows it. Occasionally you may be asked if an observer can be present. You can give the doctor any evidence which was not included with your claim form, if you think it will help them to give an opinion on your disablement.</p>

<p>If you have attended a hospital in connection with the disease you are claiming for, the doctor may seek further information from the hospital. Hospital case notes may be requested by the doctor to assist in giving an opinion. The doctor could also ask for a report from your <abbr title="General Practitioner">GP</abbr>.</p>

<p>The doctor will take a statement from you and send a written report to the decision maker based upon the examination and any other medical evidence.</p>

<p>The doctor will advise on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether you are suffering from a prescribed disease, and if so</li>
  <li>whether you have suffered a loss of faculty from the disease, and if so</li>
  <li>the level of your disablement and how long it is expected to last</li>
</ul>

<p>If the doctor has advised that you are suffering from a prescribed disease he will also advise on the date of onset of the disease.</p>

<p>The doctor will also provide an explanation for the decision maker as to how they arrived at their opinion.</p>

<p>The doctor will also advise if, in their opinion, the disease is due to the nature of your employed earner’s employment. This is called causation.</p>

<h4 id="special-arrangements">Special arrangements</h4>

<p>For some prescribed diseases you will need to have tests before the medical examination.</p>

<h4 id="occupational-deafness">Occupational deafness</h4>

<p>In claims for occupational deafness, we will arrange for you to have a hearing test to see if you have an average hearing loss of at least 50 decibels in both ears due to damage to the inner ear. In at least one ear this must be due to noise at work. If the doctor advises that you satisfy this test you will then have a medical examination. If not, your claim will be sent back to the decision maker who will consider whether to disallow it.</p>

<h4 id="chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease----copd-previously-known-as-chronic-bronchitis-and-emphysema">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> (previously known as Chronic bronchitis and emphysema)</h4>

<p>In claims for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>, it may be necessary for you to have a breathing test. If the doctor advises that you satisfy this test you will then have a medical examination. If not, your claim will be sent back to the decision maker who will consider whether to disallow it.</p>

<h4 id="pneumoconiosis">Pneumoconiosis</h4>

<p>In claims for pneumoconiosis, we will normally arrange for you to have an X-ray of your chest. If the X-ray and other evidence shows that you may have the disease you will then have a medical examination. If the X-ray shows no trace of the disease your claim will be sent back to the decision maker who will consider whether to disallow it.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-loss-of-faculty-1">What is a loss of faculty?</h4>

<p>Loss of physical or mental faculty means some loss of power or function of an organ of the body. Loss of faculty can include disfigurement even when this causes no bodily handicap. Whether a loss of faculty results in disability is decided by comparing your condition as a result of the disease with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex. (Legislation (58) - Commissioners Decisions R(I)7/67 and R(I)1/81)</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-date-of-onset">What is the date of onset?</h4>

<p>The date of onset of a disease is the date you first suffered a loss of faculty from the disease. The date of onset may be earlier than the date that benefit is actually paid from. This is because the date benefit is paid from is governed by time limits for claiming and other criteria. (Legislation (59) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 6(2)(b))</p>

<h4 id="degree-of-disablement-1">Degree of disablement</h4>

<p>The medical advice or assessment takes account of all disabilities resulting from the disease. Where your disability also results from some other cause which arose before you got the disease, the degree of disablement which would in any event be present due to that other cause is not counted, but the interaction between the two causes is included in the assessment.</p>

<p>For example, an assembly worker who had previously fractured her right arm in a road accident is diagnosed as having prescribed disease A4 (cramp of the hand or forearm) in the same arm.</p>

<p>The doctor considers a gross assessment of disablement for upper limb dysfunction and deducts an amount for the disablement that remains due to the earlier accident.</p>

<p>If your disablement is 11% or more, and some other condition arises after the accident or disease but is not directly caused by it, any increase in your disablement due to the disease as a result of that other cause is also used to work out your disablement.</p>

<p>For example, a man who is diagnosed as having prescribed disease A11 (vibration white finger) has also developed osteoarthritis in one of his fingers at a later date.</p>

<p>The doctor considers an assessment of disablement for upper limb dysfunction and if that assessment is over 11% the doctor adds a further assessment for the extent that the osteoarthritis increases the man’s disability. (Legislation (60) - SS (Gen Ben) Regs 1982 reg 11)</p>

<h4 id="different-types-of-assessment">Different types of assessment</h4>

<p>You may be given a ‘final’ assessment of disablement for life if your disability is assessed as permanent and is unlikely to change. Or where you are likely to make a full recovery the assessment may be final but for a limited period. Or you may be given a provisional assessment for a limited period at the end of which you will be re-examined and your disablement assessed again. (Legislation (61) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 6(2))</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-on-your-claim-1">
<span class="number">5.5 </span>The decision on your claim</h3>

<p>After the medical examination your claim will be decided by a decision maker. The decision maker will look at the doctor’s advice and any other available evidence.</p>

<p>We will write to tell you the decision on your claim, the amount of any benefit you will get and the period for which you will get benefit.</p>

<p>The decision only takes account of your physical or mental condition it is not related to whether or not you are capable of work. It can be paid whether or not you have returned to work and it does not depend on your earnings.</p>

<p>Loss of earnings and other circumstances may, however, mean you can get one or more of the other benefits described later in this guide.</p>

<span class="number">5.6 </span>Payment of benefit</h3>

<h4 id="how-much-benefit-you-will-get-1">How much benefit you will get</h4>

<p>The amount of benefit you get depends on how badly you are disabled by the disease.</p>

<p>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit cannot be paid for the first 15 weeks (90 days not including Sundays), after the date of onset of the disease. (Legislation (62) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(6))</p>

<p>The exception to this is in claims for occupational deafness, when payment can only be made from the date the claim form is received in an office of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>, and in claims for diffuse mesothelioma and asbestos-related lung cancer, when payment can be made from the date you were first disabled by the disease but not for more than 3 months before the date of your claim. (Legislation (63) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 6(2)(c), SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 20(4)(a), SS (C&P) Regs 1987 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 4)</p>

<p>You will not normally get benefit if your disablement is less than 14%. (Legislation (64) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(1), SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(2))</p>

<p>But you may be able to get benefit if you have had more than 1 accident or disease and the total disablement, when the effects of all the accidents and diseases are added together, is 14% or more. This is known as aggregation.</p>

<p>If your disablement is at least 14% your benefit will be paid as a weekly pension. (Legislation (65) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(2), SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 22)</p>

<p>If your disablement is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>between 14% and 19% you will get a pension at the 20% rate</li>
  <li>20% or over it will be rounded up or down to the nearest 10%. (Legislation (66) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 103(3), SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 15)</li>

<h3 id="rules-for-specific-diseases">
<span class="number">5.7 </span>Rules for specific diseases</h3>

<h4 id="pneumoconiosis-and-byssinosis">Pneumoconiosis and byssinosis</h4>

<p>For the respiratory diseases pneumoconiosis, byssinosis you can get benefit if your disablement is assessed as at least 1%. (Legislation (67) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 20A(1))</p>

<h4 id="diffuse-mesothelioma">Diffuse mesothelioma</h4>

<p>For the respiratory disease diffuse mesothelioma your disablement will be assessed as being 100%. (Legislation (67) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 20A(1))</p>

<h4 id="asbestos-related-lung-cancer">Asbestos-related lung cancer</h4>

<p>For this respiratory disease your disablement will be assessed as being 100%.</p>

<h4 id="occupational-deafness-1">Occupational deafness</h4>

<p>To get benefit for occupational deafness, your disablement must be assessed as 20% or more. (Legislation (68) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 29(a))</p>

<p>If the assessment is less than 20% for occupational deafness it cannot be aggregated with any other assessment of disablement. (Legislation (69) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 15(3))</p>

<h4 id="chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease--copd">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>
</h4>

<p>If you claim for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> you must not already be getting any benefit which takes full account of this condition.</p>

<p>For example, if you have been awarded Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for pneumoconiosis and your disablement from pneumoconiosis, or pneumoconiosis with tuberculosis, has been assessed at 50% or more you may have already had your benefit increased to take full account of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr>.</p>

<p>If so you will not qualify separately for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> but if you think your <abbr title="chronic obstructive pulmonary disease">COPD</abbr> has got worse, you should apply to have your assessment for pneumoconiosis looked at again in case it can be increased.</p>

<h3 id="how-you-are-paid-1">
<span class="number">5.8 </span>How you are paid</h3>

<p>Our policy is to pay all benefits directly into an account.</p>

<p>This is the safest way to pay you and lets you choose how and when you get your money. You can use a bank or building society.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a cash machine, which will usually mean you can get your money at any time of the day or night.</p>

<p>There are arrangements with banks and building societies so that you can collect cash from some of their accounts at your Post Office® branch.</p>

<p>The other advantages of having your money paid into an account are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can get your money from many different places</li>
  <li>from some accounts you could have regular bills paid - this could save you money but you will need to make sure that there is enough money in your account to pay the bills, if not, you may be charged a fee</li>
  <li>using an account may help you save</li>
</ul>

<p>The account can be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>the name of your partner. We use partner to mean a person you are married to or a person you live with as if you were married to them, or a civil partner or a person you live with as if you are civil partners</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and your partner</li>
  <li>the name of the person acting on your behalf</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and the person acting on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefit is paid either every 4 weeks, every 13 weeks or every week.</p>

<p>If you have a bank or building society account but you do not wish to use it, for example a joint account, any bank or building society will help you open an account that suits you better. Remember to ask whether their accounts allow you to get your money from the Post Office®, if this is important to you.</p>

<h4 id="basic-bank-account-1">Basic bank account</h4>

<p>If you have had problems opening a current account, or if you are worried about being overdrawn, you could ask any bank or building society about opening a basic bank account.</p>

<p>These are sometimes called introductory or starter accounts and are available from all major banks.</p>

<p>These accounts offer free banking but overdrafts are not available.</p>

<p>You can use these accounts to pay money in, pay bills automatically and get cash out.</p>

<p>Many basic bank accounts also allow you to get cash from Post Offices®.</p>

<h4 id="if-your-circumstances-change-1">If your circumstances change</h4>

<p>A decision can be looked at again at any time if your condition has changed.</p>

<p>If you feel your condition has got worse and you want us to have another look at the decision, complete and return form BI168, which you can get from Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre.</p>

<p>If the condition for which you are getting benefit improves you must tell us straight away.</p>

<p>If you are receiving Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit you must also tell us if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marry, remarry, or form a civil partnership and change your name</li>
  <li>change your address</li>
  <li>leave the country</li>
  <li>go into prison</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these apply, you must tell Barnsley Industrial Injuries Benefit Delivery Centre straight away. You can contact them on 0800 121 8379. (Legislation (70) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 3)</p>

<p>If you intend to be away for more than 3 months, payment of your benefit will be made by the International Pensions Centre (<abbr title="International Pensions Centre">IPC</abbr>).</p>

<p>You will be asked how you want your payments to be made while you are away. You can choose between:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Direct Payment to a United Kingdom (UK) bank, building society or Post Office® card account every 4 or 13 weeks</li>
  <li>payable orders sent directly to you every 4 or 13 weeks while you are away</li>
  <li>Transcontinental Automated Payments (<abbr title="Transcontinental Automated Payments">TAPS</abbr>), if the country has this arrangement with Jobcentre Plus</li>
  <li>payment to a nominee</li>
  <li>payment when you return to the UK</li>

<p>You must let us know when you return to the UK.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-go-to-prison-1">If you go to prison</h4>

<p>If you go into prison, you must let us know the date you were admitted.</p>

<p>Payment of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is suspended during any period of imprisonment.</p>

<p>When you are released let us know the date. Arrears of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit may be paid for the period of imprisonment subject to a maximum of one year’s benefit.</p>

<h2 id="constant-attendance-allowance">
<span class="number">6. </span>Constant Attendance Allowance</h2>

<h3 id="conditions-of-entitlement">
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Conditions of entitlement</h3>

<p>Constant Attendance Allowance (<abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr>) can be paid if you need constant care and attention as a result of your injury or disease. (Legislation (71) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 104)</p>

<p>You can get <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are dependent on attendance for the necessities of life</li>
  <li>the attendance is needed as a result of the relevant loss of faculty and attendance will be needed for a prolonged period</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr> cannot be paid for help with ordinary housework or for similar domestic purposes, and it is not paid simply for help with dressing and undressing</p>

<p>To be entitled to <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr>, you have to show that you need daily attendance and are likely to need it for a long time. Although you must show that you need daily attendance, the attendance need not last throughout the day and you may not actually receive it.</p>

<p>Attendance need not be provided on a paid basis and <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr> can still be paid when attendance is provided by a relative.</p>

<p>Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit must be the 100% rate payable for you to be considered for <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr>. (Legislation (72) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 104(1))</p>

<p>But you may also receive it if you get Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit of less than 100% and payments for disablement under the War Pension scheme which bring your total disablement to at least 100% (Legislation (73) - SS (Gen Ben) Regs 1982 reg 20).</p>

<h3 id="how-and-when-to-claim">

<p>If Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is payable at the 100% rate, an opinion will automatically be given for <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr> at the time of your medical examination.</p>

<p>You only need apply for <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr> if you are already receiving Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit at the 100% rate, did not have any attendance needs at the time of your award, but your condition means that you now need constant attendance. If you are already in receipt of <abbr title="Constant Attendance Allowance">CAA</abbr>, but your condition has worsened since the award, you may be entitled to an increase. You should claim on form BI107 which you can get from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit/further-information">Barnsley Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre</a>. You can contact them on 0800 121 8379.</p>

<h3 id="how-claims-are-decided-1">
<span class="number">6.3 </span>How claims are decided</h3>

<p>Medical services carry out an examination at the same time as giving an opinion on the extent of your disablement for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. The doctor will complete a report and advise on your need for attendance. They will look at and consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the nature and amount of attendance you need</li>
  <li>if you are dependent on attendance for the necessities of life</li>
  <li>if you need attendance as a result of the relevant loss of faculty</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision maker will consider the doctors report and any other evidence and will decide the rate, amount and period of the award. The award will be renewed if you continue to satisfy the conditions.</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-on-your-claim-2">

<span class="number">8. </span>Reduced Earnings Allowance</h2>

<h3 id="conditions-of-entitlement-1">
<span class="number">8.1 </span>Conditions of entitlement</h3>

<p>Reduced Earnings Allowance (<abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr>) is a separate benefit to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. It can be paid on its own or in addition to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> was introduced from 1 October 1986 and replaced Special Hardship Allowance (<abbr title="Special Hardship Allowance">SHA</abbr>). (Legislation (81) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 11(1))</p>

<p><abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> can be paid on top of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. If you do not get Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit because your disablement is less than 14% you can still get <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> as long as your disablement is assessed at 1% or more.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> compensates for the loss of earnings’ capacity where, as a result of an industrial accident or disease, you are unable to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>return to your regular occupation</li>
  <li>carry out other work producing the same level of earnings</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no entitlement to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> for an accident:</p>

<ul>
  <li>which occurred on or after 1 October 1990 (Legislation (81) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 11(1)) or</li>
  <li>a prescribed disease with a date of onset on or after 1 October 1990 or</li>
  <li>prescribed disease which was added to the list of prescribed diseases on or after 10 October 1994 irrespective of the date of onset or</li>
  <li>an extension to a prescribed disease made on or after 10 October 1994 irrespective of the date of onset</li>
</ul>

<p>To be entitled to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> you must satisfy the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have an assessment of disablement of at least 1%</li>
  <li>be incapable of following your regular occupation as a result of the relevant loss of faculty</li>
  <li>be incapable of work of an equivalent standard which is considered suitable in your case and:</li>
  <li>either are likely to be permanently incapable of following your regular occupation (known as the permanent condition)</li>
  <li>or at all times since the end of the 90 day period (excluding Sundays) following the date of accident or date of onset of the prescribed disease, have been incapable of your regular occupation or suitable alternative employment (known as the continuous condition)</li>
</ul>

<p>A regular occupation must be gainful employment, but it does not have to be employed earner‘s employment. This will occur when the work done at the time of the accident was employed earner‘s employment but it was not your regular occupation.</p>

<p>A regular occupation for a prescribed disease is normally the occupation which caused the disease.</p>

<p>Whether other employment is of an equivalent standard depends mainly on whether the pay is comparable. But your chances of promotion to higher paid work in your regular occupation can also be taken into account in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Only employed earner’s employment can be considered as employment of an equivalent standard. (Legislation (82) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 11(5)(b))</p>

<p>If you gave up an occupation because of the relevant loss of faculty due to the prescribed disease for which you have an assessment, that occupation can be your regular occupation even if you stopped following it before the prescribed disease was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>added to the list of prescribed diseases</li>
  <li>altered to include your work</li>
</ul>

<p>Your occupation may be treated as your regular occupation if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>had to give up an occupation because of the effects of an industrial accident or prescribed disease and</li>
  <li>subsequently receive a disablement assessment for that accident or disease (Legislation (83) - SS (II) (PD) Regs 1985 reg 17)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are suffering from pneumoconiosis and the doctor who examined you for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit purposes gave advice about the conditions in which you should work, there are rules which may help you qualify for <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> if you leave your regular occupation. You will usually be regarded as unable to continue in that occupation or to do work of an equivalent standard. This will apply even if the doctor advised that you could continue in your occupation in suitable dust conditions.</p>

<p>If you have more than 1 accident or prescribed disease, you can claim <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> for each accident or prescribed disease.</p>

<h3 id="how-and-when-to-claim-1">
<span class="number">8.2 </span>How and when to claim</h3>

<p>Contact us on 0800 121 8379 for a claim form BI103.</p>

<p>The date of your claim is the date your fully completed claim form is received in an office of the <abbr title="Department for Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr>. It is very important that you carefully fill in all the details on the form and return it to Barrow Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre as soon as possible. The office mailing address is on the claim form. (Legislation (84) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 reg 6)</p>

<p>Claim as soon as you think you meet the rules for the allowance. Do not delay claiming until the result of your Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit claim is determined, as you could lose benefit for any period more than 3 months before the date of claim. (Legislation (85) - SS (C&P) Regs 1987 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 4 para 5)</p>

<p>If you want help filling in your claim form, contact us on 0800 121 8379.</p>

<h3 id="how-claims-are-decided-3">
<span class="number">8.3 </span>How claims are decided</h3>

<p>When you have completed the claim form return it to Barrow Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre. Barrow’s mailing address is on the claim form.</p>

<p>Your papers are then sent to medical services for advice on whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you are capable of following your regular occupation</li>
  <li>the date from which you are incapable of following your regular occupation</li>
  <li>you are temporarily or permanently incapable of following your regular occupation</li>
  <li>you are incapable of alternative remunerative employment</li>
  <li>if you are not completely incapable of work, what limitations, if any, exist which restrict the type of work you can do</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision maker will use this advice to determine whether or not you have any entitlement to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-on-your-claim-4">
<span class="number">8.4 </span>The decision on your claim</h3>

<p>We may contact your current or previous employers to obtain employment and earnings information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your regular occupation</li>
  <li>your present occupation</li>
  <li>any occupation you have had since your accident or disease</li>
</ul>

<p>If your regular occupation no longer exists, your earnings may be calculated by referring to an index based on the changes in the level of earnings as published in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> will be awarded for a limited period. At the end of this period, we will invite you to make a renewal <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> claim unless your assessment of disablement was final and expires at the same time as the <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> award.</p>

<p>We will send you a renewal form before your award ends. If you were entitled to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> on 30 September 1990 and you subsequently cease to be entitled for 1 or more days, you cannot again become entitled to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> for that accident or prescribed disease. You should complete and return the form as soon as possible to avoid any delays in payment or a possible permanent loss of your entitlement to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr>. You must still complete a renewal form even if payment is temporarily suspended for any reason. The decision maker will decide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether up-to-date medical advice is needed</li>
  <li>if further employment enquiries need to be made</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-much-benefit-you-will-get-3">
<span class="number">8.6 </span>How much benefit you will get</h3>

<p>The amount of <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> payable is the difference between your earnings in your regular and alternative occupations. There is a maximum amount of <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> payable, even if the difference in earnings between your regular and alternative occupation is greater than this amount.</p>

<p>This maximum is equivalent to the 40% rate of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. (Legislation (86) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 11(10))</p>

<p>If you receive more than 1 <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> award, the maximum amount of <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> and any Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit you can receive equates to the 140% rate of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.</p>

<p>You will be notified of the amount of benefit you are entitled to.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> under the Industrial Injuries Scheme can be paid as well as an allowance for a lower standard of occupation under the War Pension scheme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr>, like most social security benefits, goes up from time to time, but your <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> will not be increased if before 9 April 1989 you received <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> and retired for social security purposes.</p>

<p>If you reach pension age now, your entitlement to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> is transferred to entitlement to Retirement Allowance if you are not in regular employment. (Legislation (87) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 12)</p>

<h3 id="how-you-are-paid-4">
<span class="number">8.7 </span>How you are paid</h3>
<p>Our policy is to pay all benefits directly into an account.</p>

<p>This is the safest way to pay you and lets you choose how and when you get your money. You can use a bank or building society.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a cash machine, which will usually mean you can get your money at any time of the day or night.</p>

<p>There are arrangements with banks and building societies so that you can collect cash from some of their accounts at your Post Office® branch.</p>

<p>The Post Office® also provides a bank account that we can pay benefits into. With this account you can only collect your money in cash from Post Office® branches.</p>

<p>The other advantages of having your money paid into an account are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can get your money from many different places</li>
  <li>from some accounts you could have regular bills paid - this could save you money but you will need to make sure that there is enough money in your account to pay the bills, if not, you may be charged a fee</li>
  <li>using an account may help you save</li>
</ul>

<p>The account can be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your name</li>
  <li>the name of your partner - we use partner to mean a person you are married to or a person you live with as if you were married to them, or a civil partner or a person you live with as if you are civil partners</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and your partner</li>
  <li>the name of the person acting on your behalf</li>
  <li>the names of both yourself and the person acting on your behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefit is paid either every 4 weeks, every 13 weeks or every week.</p>

<p>If you have a bank or building society account but you do not wish to use it, for example a joint account, any bank or building society will help you open an account that suits you better. Remember to ask whether their accounts allow you to get your money from the Post Office® if this is important to you.</p>

<h3 id="basic-bank-account-2">
<span class="number">8.8 </span>Basic bank account</h3>

<p>If you have had problems opening a current account, or if you are worried about being overdrawn, you could ask any bank or building society about opening a basic bank account.</p>

<p>These are sometimes called introductory or starter accounts and are available from all major banks.</p>

<p>These accounts offer free banking but overdrafts are not available.</p>

<p>You can use these accounts to pay money in, pay bills automatically and get cash out.</p>

<p>Many basic bank accounts also allow you to get cash from Post Offices®.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-circumstances-change-4">
<span class="number">8.9 </span>If your circumstances change</h3>

<ul>
  <li>your stay is temporary</li>
  <li>your stay is not for business purposes in any way</li>

</ul>

<p>(Legislation (88) - SSB (PA) Regs 1975 reg 9(5))</p>

<p>To qualify for <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> when you return to the UK, you must have had title to <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> throughout your stay even if <abbr title="Reduced Earnings Allowance">REA</abbr> is not paid during part of the absence.

  <li>have not received a payment in respect of the disease from an employer, a civil claim or elsewhere and</li>
  <li>are not entitled to compensation from a Ministry of Defence scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme covers people whose exposure to asbestos occurred in the United Kingdom and was not as a result of their work as an employee. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you came into contact with asbestos from a relative, eg by washing their clothes</li>
  <li>you were exposed to asbestos in the environment, eg you lived near a factory using asbestos</li>
  <li>your exposure to asbestos was while you were self-employed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-claim-3">
<span class="number">11.5 </span>How to claim</h3>

<p>You should make a claim as soon as possible. Claims must be received within 12 months of your date of diagnosis. You should submit medical evidence with your claim showing that you are suffering from diffuse mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos. Your lung cancer nurse may be able to supply this. No further medical examination will be offered.</p>

<p>If the sufferer has died, their dependants may be able to claim. The claim form must be received within 12 months of the date of death.</p>

<span class="number">12. </span>Simplification changes under the Welfare Reform Act 2012</h2>

<p>From 5 December 2012, the following changes were made to the Industrial Injuries Scheme to make it easier for people to understand and for the Department to administer the benefits.</p>

<h3 id="the-pneumoconiosis-byssinosis-and-miscellaneous-diseases-benefit-scheme-and-the-workmens-compensation-supplementation-scheme">
<span class="number">12.1 </span>The Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit Scheme, and the Workmen’s Compensation (Supplementation) Scheme</h3>

<p>These 2 old schemes that dealt with industrial accidents or disease exposures before 1948 were abolished on 5 December 2012. Those customers in receipt of payments were transferred to the main Industrial Injuries Scheme and received benefits at the corresponding rates of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.</p>

<h3 id="death-benefit">
<span class="number">12.2 </span>Death Benefit</h3>
<p>If you were supported by someone formerly entitled under the PB&MD scheme, and who has since died from one of the diseases listed under the PB&MD scheme, you may get a payment of up to £300. (Legislation (125) - PB&MDB Scheme 1983 Article 9)
For a claim form write to or phone the PWC team at Barrow Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre at:</p>

<p>Telephone: 0800 279 2322</p>

<p>Send your completed claim form to this address also. You should normally claim within 3 months of the death.</p>

<h3 id="the-under-18-rates-of-industrial-injuries-disablement-benefit">
<span class="number">12.3 </span>The under 18 rates of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit</h3>

<p>On 5 December 2012, the lower rate of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit paid to people under the age of 18 was abolished. Everyone with the same level of disability will receive the same rate of benefit.</p>

<h3 id="industrial-accident-declarations">
<span class="number">12.4 </span>Industrial Accident declarations</h3>

<p>From 5 December 2012, it will not be possible to request a declaration that an industrial accident occurred without a claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit being made.</p>

<h3 id="industrial-death-benefit">
<span class="number">12.5 </span>Industrial Death Benefit</h3>

<p>Industrial Death Benefit was abolished in 1988 for any deaths occurring after 1988. From 5 December 2012, it will not be possible for a new claim to be made for a death before 1988. No claims had been made for many years and any widows or widowers still getting payments will continue to receive them.</p>

<h3 id="if-your-circumstances-change-7">
<span class="number">12.6 </span>If your circumstances change</h3>

<p>Industrial Death Benefit for a widow is usually a pension payable for life following the deceased’s death. It is not payable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you remarry or form a civil partnership (Legislation (104) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 15(2))</li>
  <li>for any period when you and a man you are not married to are living together as husband and wife (Legislation (105) - SS C&B Act 1992 <abbr title="Schedule">Sched</abbr> 7 para 15(3))</li>
  <li>if you are in prison (Legislation (106) - SS C&B Act 1992 sec 113(1))</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above apply you must tell the Industrial Death Benefit section at Barrow Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Centre straight away.</p>

<h3 id="if-you-die-3">
<span class="number">12.7 </span>If you die</h3>

<p>If you die, someone should let us know straight away.</p>

<h2 id="further-information-1">
<span class="number">13. </span>Further information</h2>

<h3 id="rates-of-benefits">
<span class="number">13.1 </span>Rates of benefits</h3>

<p>Rates of benefits are published each year in the Social Security Benefits Uprating Order, which is debated by Parliament, usually towards the end of the year. Benefits are usually uprated from April, at the beginning of the financial year. For current rates see <a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/dwp035.pdf">benefit and pension rates (PDF, 210KB)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="social-security-leaflets">
<span class="number">13.2 </span>Social security leaflets</h3>

<p>You can get copies of the leaflets from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jobcentre Plus for Jobcentre Plus leaflets and most others</li>
  <li>Post offices or Jobcentre Plus offices for the main leaflets</li>
  <li>your local council for leaflets on Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit</li>

<h3 id="the-acts-regulations-and-the-blue-volumes">
<span class="number">13.3 </span>The Acts, Regulations and the ‘Blue Volumes’</h3>

<p>The Acts and Regulations which set down the rules explained in this guide are included in a series of loose-leaf books, The <a rel="external" href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/specialist-guides/law-volumes/">Law relating to Social Security</a> (also known as the Blue Volumes) which are published by the Stationery Office. The relevant Acts and Regulations are indexed and kept up to date by regular supplements. You can consult a copy at your Jobcentre Plus office, and many libraries also have a copy. Copies can also be bought from the Stationery Office.</p>

<p>This technical guide is only a guide to Industrial Injuries Benefits. It has no status in law, but it refers you to the Acts and Regulations which cover particular rules. The Regulations may be changed or added to from time to time by Amendment Regulations. Also, each year a set of Uprating Regulations is published changing the benefit rates.</p>

<p>The main Acts and Regulations which govern Industrial Injuries Benefits are currently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social Security Act 1998</li>
  <li>Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992</li>
