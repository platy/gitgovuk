<h2>Help to buy: Equity loan 2021 to 2023 programme</h2>

<h3>Approved listed warranty product table</h3>

<h4>Scheme:</h4>
<p>The Help to Buy: Equity Loan 2021 to 2023 programme</p>

<h4>Funding Administration Agreement:</h4>
<p>The Help to Buy Equity Loan Funding Administration Agreement in respect of the scheme to be entered into by homebuilders wishing to participate within the scheme.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is a condition of the scheme that a property must be an eligible dwelling as defined within Clause 1.1 of the Funding Administration Agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a further condition of the Funding Administration Agreement that every eligible dwelling must have the benefit of a suitable Listed Warranty Product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clause 1.1 of the Funding Administration Agreement defines a Listed Warranty Product as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="last-child">one of the new build home guarantee or similar warranty products detailed in the table published by Homes England from time to time.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Homes England confirm that it does not at present intend to publish its own table of new build home guarantees or similar warranty products which will be acceptable for the scheme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the meantime Homes England confirm that it will accept any new home warranty schemes which are provided by a reputable insurance company and are acceptable to each buyer’s first charge mortgage lender as detailed within its Part 2 response to Section 6.7.1 of the UK Lender’s Handbook for Conveyancers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the event that the new home warranty scheme does not protect a buyer’s deposit between exchange and completion the plot sale contract must specifically state that homebuilders solicitors may only hold the deposit as stakeholder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An architect’s certificate or any other professional consultant’s certificate will not be acceptable for the scheme under any circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Homes England reserves its rights in the future to publish a table of suitable new home guarantees or similar warranty products.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
