<p>Frequently asked questions for Homebuilders about the closedown of Help to Buy: Equity Loan (2021-2023) applications.</p>

<h2>What is the final date a homebuilder can register for Help to Buy, to sell homes before the scheme ends in March 2023?</h2>
<p>The last date homebuilders can apply to become a Help to Buy registered homebuilder is 5pm on 29 July 2022. It takes Homes England at least 8 weeks to register a homebuilder for Help to Buy. All homebuilders must be in contract before they can advertise and take reservations for Help to Buy homes.</p>

<h2>What key dates are homebuilders working to as we move closer to the end of Help to Buy in March 2023</h2>
<p>All Help to Buy Eligible Dwellings MUST have reached Practical Completion by 31 December 2022 (First Longstop Date).
All Help to Buy Eligible Dwellings MUST have legally completed on or before 31 March 2023 (Second Longstop Date). Homebuyers are expected to have the keys to their home by 6pm. Homebuilders must tell homebuyers in advance if they cannot meet these dates.</p>

<h2>What happens if the purchase cannot complete by 31 March 2023?</h2>
<p>If exchange and legal completion cannot happen by 31 March 2023 (Second Longstop Date), homebuilders must return the reservation fee in full.
Additionally, if contracts have been exchanged, homebuilders are required to unconditionally release the buyer from the contract and refund their full deposit as soon as possible. Homebuyers must legally complete on or before 31 March 2023 and are expected to have the keys to their home by 6pm.</p>

<h2>Are there plans to extend or replace the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme?</h2>
<p>No, the government announced that the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme would run until 31 March 2023. There are no current plans to extend or replace Help to Buy: Equity Loan.</p>

<h2>Why do Help to Buy Eligible Dwellings need to reach Practical Completion by 31 December 2022 (First Longstop Date)?</h2>
<p>Under the terms of the Help to Buy: Equity Loan Funding Administration Agreement, homebuilders are required to reach Practical Completion by 31 December 2022 (First Longstop Date).
This aims to give homebuyers enough time to legally complete before the scheme ends on 31 March 2023.</p>

<h2>Why is the deadline for Practical Completion on 31 December 2022?</h2>
<p>This deadline is to give homebuyers time to exchange and get the keys to their homes no later than 6pm on 31 March 2023. The dates have been agreed with HM Treasury and the Department of Levelling Up, Homes and Communities.
Eligible Dwellings must legally complete on or before 31 March 2023 (Second Longstop Date) to be eligible for Help to Buy: Equity Loan funding.</p>

<h2>Why must new homebuilders register by 29 July 2022?</h2>
<p>Help to Buy: Equity Loan (2021-2023) was announced in 2018 and opened for registrations in 2020. Homebuilders must register and submit a forecast for the scheme by 29 July 2022. This will ensure they are fully in contract with an accurate forecast by 30 September 2022. This is one month before homebuyer applications close on 31 October 2022.
Homebuilders must accurately forecast the number of Eligible Dwellings they aim to market, that will be eligible for equity loan funding.</p>

<h2>Why has this news emerged now?</h2>
<p>In 2018 the Help to Buy: Equity Loan (2021-2023) scheme was announced to support first time homebuyers. The scheme launched on 1 April 2021 and will end on 31 March 2023.
We have worked closely with HM Treasury and the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities to confirm the dates leading up to the end of the scheme.
The deadlines are to help homebuyers get the keys to their Help to Buy homes by 31 March 2023.</p>

<h2>Why is the application deadline on 31 October 2022?</h2>
<p>The application deadline has been set for 6pm on 31 October 2022. This should give homebuyers time to legally complete the purchase of their home before Help to Buy: Equity Loan (2021-2023) ends on 31 March 2023.
The dates have been agreed with HM Treasury and the Department of Levelling Up, Homes and Communities.</p>

<h2>Can the details of the PIF be changed once it has been submitted?</h2>
<p>Details on the Property Information Form (PIF) must be correct when homebuyers apply for the scheme. Homebuilders should ensure the homebuyer has the correct information to complete the PIF before 6pm on 31 October 2022.
If there are changes to the PIF which are not accepted the homebuyer cannot re-apply after 31 October 2022. There is no guarantee that changes will be accepted.</p>

<h2>The 31 December 2022 (First Longstop Date) is a Saturday. What implication does this have?</h2>
<p>Homebuilders will need to consider their working days during December 2022 to ensure that this deadline is met. This may mean Practical Completion is confirmed before Saturday 31 December 2022 to meet the deadline.
Our Help to Buy agents’ offices close during Bank Holidays and they will not be able to process applications when closed.</p>

<h2>When do homebuilders stop advertising Help to Buy?</h2>
<p>As applications close at 6pm on 31 October 2022, this is the last day that Help to Buy: Equity Loan can be advertised. All promotion of Help to Buy: Equity Loan (2021-2023) must end on this date or must stop when their last Help to Buy eligible home has been reserved.</p>

<h2>What happens if homebuilders sell all Help to Buy homes before 31 October 2022?</h2>
<p>Homebuilders must stop advertising and marketing Help to Buy: Equity Loan once their last Help to Buy Eligible Dwelling has been reserved.</p>

<h2>Is the government supporting with the cost of removing Help to Buy advertising?</h2>
<p>Costs incurred to remove advertising and marketing activities are the responsibility of the homebuilder.</p>
