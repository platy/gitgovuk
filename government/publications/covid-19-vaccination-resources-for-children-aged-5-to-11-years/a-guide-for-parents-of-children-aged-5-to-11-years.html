<p>The NHS is offering coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines to children aged 5 to 11 years.</p>

<p>Experts have advised that parents of all children aged 5 to 11 years should be offered the chance to have their child vaccinated.</p>

<p>Vaccination is particularly important for children who have health conditions that put them at high risk from COVID-19, as the benefits are greater.</p>

<h2>What is COVID-19 or coronavirus?</h2>
<p>For most children COVID-19 is a mild illness that may require a few days off school but rarely leads to complications. For a very few children, the symptoms may be more serious or last longer.</p>

<p>The current Omicron variant appears to be particularly mild in children. It is not known if future variants will be as mild.</p>

<h2>Which children are at high risk from COVID-19 infection?</h2>
<p>Children with certain health conditions, or those with a weakened immune system are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>These children and those who live with someone who has a weakened immune system should already have been invited for vaccination.</p>

<p>For more information on the health conditions, you can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-resources-for-children-aged-5-to-11-years">guide for parents of children aged 5 to 11 years at high risk</a> or talk to your specialist or GP.</p>

<h2>Will the vaccine protect your child?</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 vaccination will reduce the chance of your child suffering from COVID-19 disease. It may take a few weeks for their body to build up some protection from the vaccine.</p>

<p>Two doses of the vaccine should give your child long lasting protection against serious complications of infection, including any future waves due to new variants.</p>

<p>Your child should also have some protection from the mild symptoms. The protection against mild Omicron infection should last for several weeks.</p>

<p>Like all medicines, no vaccine is completely effective.  Some children may still get COVID-19 despite having a vaccination, but this should be less severe.</p>

<p>Further information is available on symptoms on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/" rel="external">NHS.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>About the vaccine</h2>
<p>Children will be offered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Each vaccine is a third of the dose of vaccine that is given to older children and adults.</p>

<p>Children at greater risk of serious illness if they catch COVID-19 will need 2 doses of vaccine, 8 weeks apart. All other children will be offered 2 doses of vaccine 12 weeks apart.</p>

<p>The vaccine has been tested to make sure it is as safe as possible. You can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/12634/pil#gref" rel="external">Pfizer leaflet</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Side effects</h2>

<h3>Common side effects</h3>
<p>Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild and short-term and not everyone gets them. The very common side effects should only last a day or two. The Pfizer vaccine tends to cause more side effects after the second dose than the first dose.</p>

<p>Very common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a painful, heavy feeling and tenderness in the arm where you had your injection. This tends to be worst around 1 to 2 days after the vaccination</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>headache</li>
  <li>general aches, or mild flu like symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child should rest and, if they are at school, they may need to take a day or two off.</p>

<p>You can give them paracetamol (follow the children’s dose advice in the packaging) to help make them feel better. More information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-children/" rel="external">paracetamol for children</a> is available.</p>

<p>Although feeling feverish is not uncommon for 2 to 3 days, a high temperature is unusual and may indicate that your child has COVID-19 or another infection.</p>

<p>Symptoms following vaccination normally last less than a week. If your child’s symptoms seem to get worse or if you are concerned, you can call NHS 111.</p>

<h3>Less common side effects</h3>
<p>Cases of inflammation of the heart (called myocarditis or pericarditis) have been reported very rarely after COVID-19 vaccines. Most cases recovered and felt better following rest and simple treatments.</p>

<p>In the US, all side effects have been reported much less commonly after the children’s dose of vaccine. So far, only 1 to 2 cases of myocarditis have been reported for every million doses of vaccine given.</p>

<p>You should seek medical advice urgently if your child experiences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest pain</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are worried about your child call NHS 111 (or call 18001 111 on a textphone) or go to the NHS 111 website.</p>

<p>Make sure you tell them about the vaccination your child has received or show them your child’s record card.</p>

<p>If you think they have had a serious side effect from the vaccine you can report it using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" rel="external">Coronavirus Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>When can you take your child to be vaccinated?</h2>
<p>Parents will receive information offering them the chance to make an appointment for their child to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>These appointments will be available from April over the Easter holidays and further slots will become available later.</p>

<h2>How to book your appointment</h2>
<p>The information you receive will explain how to make the appointment for your child.</p>

<p>You can call the National Booking Service on 119 to make an appointment.</p>

<p>You will need to take your child to a local pharmacy or vaccination centre.</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>When your child has had their first injection, you should get a record card.</p>

<p>You should keep this card and bring it with you when taking your child for their next appointment. This will be in 8 to 12 weeks’ time.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give your child good protection, they will need the second dose to get longer-lasting protection.</p>

<p>Keep their card safe and make sure you take your child to get their second injection.</p>

<h2>What to do if your child is not well when their appointment is due</h2>
<p>You should not attend a vaccine appointment if you or your child are self-isolating or waiting for a COVID-19 test.</p>

<p>If your child has tested positive for COVID-19, you should normally wait 12 weeks from the test before having the vaccine.</p>

<p>If your child had a similar illness but was not tested for COVID-19, there is no need to wait once your child is better.</p>

<h2>After the vaccine</h2>
<p>You and your child should still try to avoid catching COVID-19 infections by following the current guidance.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>You can read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/12634/pil#gref" rel="external">product information leaflet</a> for more details on your vaccine including possible side effects, on the Coronavirus Yellow Card website.</p>
