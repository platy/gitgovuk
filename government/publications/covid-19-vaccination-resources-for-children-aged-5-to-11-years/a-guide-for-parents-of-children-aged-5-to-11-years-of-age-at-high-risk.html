<h2>Who is at higher risk from coronavirus (COVID-19) infection?</h2>
<p>Children at serious risk from the complications of COVID-19 infection include those with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>severe neurodisabilities</li>
  <li>immunosuppression<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">[footnote 1]</a></sup> – those whose immune systems don’t work as well and those who live with someone who is immunosuppressed</li>
  <li>profound and multiple or severe learning disabilities</li>
  <li>being on the learning disability register</li>
  <li>those with Down’s syndrome</li>
  <li>those with long term serious conditions affecting their body. Your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> will know if they need to have the vaccine</li>
</ul>

<p>The vaccine is also recommended for those children living with people who have a weakened immune system (who are immunosuppressed). This is to reduce the risk of them passing on the infection to their family members.</p>

<p>All these children and young people who are aged 5 to 11 years of age should have the COVID-19 vaccinations.</p>

<h2>What is COVID-19 or coronavirus?</h2>
<p>COVID-19 is a very infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>Most children who get COVID-19 have no symptoms. Those that do, have mild symptoms like a bad cold.</p>

<p>A few children and young people will get very poorly and have to go to hospital.</p>

<h2>About the vaccine</h2>
<p>Children will be offered the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Each vaccine is a third of the dose of vaccine that is given to older children and adults.</p>

<p>Your child needs 2 injections of the vaccine usually 8 weeks apart. The vaccine has been tested to make sure it is as safe as possible.</p>

<h2>Knowing if your child should have a vaccine</h2>
<p>Your <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> (family doctor) or specialist should advise you about the COVID-19 vaccinations for your child.</p>

<p>Some parents may receive a letter, or a phone call to invite them for to make an appointment for their child to be vaccinated.</p>

<h2>Can you give the COVID-19 infection to anyone after you have had the vaccine?</h2>
<p>Having the vaccine makes your child less likely to get very ill from COVID-19. It will help to stop them from catching and passing on the virus.</p>

<h2>Common side effects</h2>
<p>Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Most of these are mild and short-term and not everyone gets them.</p>

<p>The very common side effects should only last a day or 2. The Pfizer vaccine tends to cause more side effects after the second dose than the first dose.</p>

<p>Common side effects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their arm feeling heavy or sore where they had the injection</li>
  <li>feeling achy or like they have the flu</li>
  <li>feeling tired</li>
  <li>having a headache</li>
</ul>

<p>If they feel feverish (like they are very hot or very cold) they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rest</li>
  <li>take paracetamol (please check that the dose and type of paracetamol is correct for their age)</li>
  <li>you can find more information on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-children/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">paracetamol for children</a> on NHS.UK</li>
</ul>

<p>They should feel better in less than a week.</p>

<h2>Rare but serious side effects</h2>
<p>Worldwide, there have been recent, rare cases of inflammation of the heart reported after the adult dose of COVID-19 vaccines. These cases have been seen within a few days of vaccination.</p>

<p>Most people felt better after a few days of simple treatment.</p>

<p>You should seek medical advice urgently if your child experiences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>chest pain</li>
  <li>shortness of breath</li>
  <li>feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are worried about your child call 111 or go to the 111 website. Make sure you tell them about the vaccine, or
show them your child’s record card.</p>

<p>If you think they have had a serious side effect from the vaccine you can report it using the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">Coronavirus Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<h2>How to book your appointment</h2>
<p>If you receive an invitation letter, it will explain how to make the appointment for your child.</p>

<p>They may be offered it by their specialist in clinics but if not you can call the National Booking Service on 119 to make an appointment.</p>

<p>You will get told where to go for your child’s vaccinations and when.</p>

<h2>What to do next</h2>
<p>When your child has had their first injection, you should get a record card. You should keep this card and bring it with you when taking your child for their next appointment.</p>

<p>This will be in 8 to 12 weeks time.</p>

<p>Although the first dose will give them good protection, they will need the second dose to get longer-lasting protection.</p>

<p>Keep their card safe and make sure you take your child to get their second injection.</p>

<h2>How long does the vaccine take to work?</h2>
<p>It can take a few weeks for the vaccine to protect your child.</p>

<h2>Does the vaccine work for everyone?</h2>
<p>The vaccine doesn’t completely stop everyone getting COVID-19, but if they do, it should still stop them from being very poorly.</p>

<h2>What to do if your child is not well when it is their next appointment</h2>
<p>Your child should not attend a vaccine appointment if they are self-isolating, waiting for a COVID-19 test or you are unsure if they are fit and well.</p>

<p>If your child has tested positive for COVID-19, you should wait 4 weeks from the test for your child to have their first or second vaccine.</p>

<h2>After the vaccine</h2>
<p>You and your child should still try to avoid catching COVID-19 infections by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>following current advice on wearing a face mask</li>
  <li>meet outdoors or if indoors, let fresh air in</li>
  <li>wash your hands carefully and often</li>
  <li>follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">current guidance</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signs of COVID-19</h2>

<p>The most important symptoms of COVID-19 are recent onset of any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new and persistent cough</li>
  <li>a high temperature</li>
  <li>loss of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the symptoms above, stay at home and arrange to have a test.</p>

<p>Further information on <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">symptoms</a> is available on NHS.UK.</p>
