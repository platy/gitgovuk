<p>New combined energy technology and retrofit packages will be designed which will aim to reduce household bills, prevent consumers going into fuel poverty and make homes warmer and more comfortable. The project will follow a “touch it once” philosophy by using digital twin technology to appraise technical and commercial service models for a particular locality, as well as ensure electricity networks are ready for the changeover. The entire consumer journey is considered, including supporting other technologies such as electric vehicle charging solutions, which will provide best value to all network customers.</p>

<p>The project will also focus on developing new methods of training to encourage and support the expansion of a skilled workforce in the supply chain, which will create low carbon jobs.</p>

<h3>Teignbridge, Devon</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Location Category: Rural</li>
  <li>Project title: Project Gaia</li>
  <li>Lead organisation: EDF Energy R&amp;D</li>
  <li>Contract value: £199,143.10</li>
  <li>Project partners: EDF Energy Customers Limited, Urbanomy UK Limited, Devon County Council, Kensa Utilities, University of Sheffield</li>
  <li>Project subcontractors: Teign Energy Community, Exeter Communities Energy Organisation, Kensa Contracting, Genius Energy Labs, Enzen, University College London</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project overview</h4>

<p>Project Gaia aims to address the upfront cost barriers of ground source heat pump installation and increase the accessibility of heat pump technology. This will be achieved by considering the feasibility of configuring heat pumps as part of an ambient shared loop array, leading to higher energy efficiencies, and maintaining consumer familiarity by following a similar business model to the existing gas network.</p>

<p>The project will engage industry, local government, academia and the local community to work together to develop a streamlined process that reduces upfront and lifetime cost of heat pumps, and improves the customer journey. The feasibility phase will identify target areas and analyse housing stock and geological aspects, as well as developing relationships and refining the business model.</p>

<p>If successful in phase 2, it is expected that the underground infrastructure would be owned and maintained by a utility company, but individual heat pump units and tertiary systems would be owned by the consumer. This split-ownership model reduces the capital cost compared to installing an individual ground source heat pump, therefore making heat pumps a more accessible and affordable option.</p>

<h3>Fenland, Cambridgeshire</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Location Category: Rural</li>
  <li>Project title: PACE Financing for Heat Pumps in Rural Cambridgeshire</li>
  <li>Lead organisation: City Science Corporation Limited</li>
