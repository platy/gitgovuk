<p>Stream 3, trial support and learning, will provide support to ensure knowledge transfer and shared learning across the Heat Pump Ready Programme. This stream will provide support to the Stream 1 projects, joining-up Stream 2 technology and tools with their the Stream 1 projects where relevant and establishing working groups to collaborate on shared elements of deployment.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</abbr> have appointed the Carbon Trust to deliver the Stream 3 contract, up to a value of £5m in funding.</p>

<p>This funding is to provide the delivery of 3 work packages which include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work package 1: Programme and project learning and collaboration</li>
  <li>Work package 2: Research and evaluation</li>
  <li>Work package 3: Knowledge and evidence dissemination</li>
</ul>

<p>The Carbon Trust will be delivering against 2 overarching objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improving Heat Pump Ready project and programme delivery through:
    <ul>
      <li>The capture and sharing of progress, evidence, knowledge, and lessons between Stream 1 projects during Phase 2 of project delivery</li>
      <li>Establishing and coordinating interactions between Stream 1 projects and special interest working groups in support of areas of common delivery</li>
      <li>Brokering relationships between Stream 1 projects and the solutions being developed in Stream 2 and other innovation programmes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Incentivising actions among key heat pump stakeholders that advance the heat pump sector and contribute to increases in heat pump deployments, including as part of high-density, localised deployments, through:
    <ul>
      <li>Developing and maintaining an understanding of stakeholder evidence and knowledge requirements, including the barriers that prevent actions taking place</li>
      <li>Using this understanding of evidence needs to develop tailored knowledge, dissemination and other guidance products that demonstrate the feasibility of heat pump installations and the overcoming of known barriers and disseminating these products amongst key stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stream 3 will&nbsp;be delivered&nbsp;through one contract over&nbsp;two Phases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Phase 1 will&nbsp;run from July 2022 to March 2023. It will focus on carrying out some initial activities under three work packages, as well as further developing a delivery plan for Phase 2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phase&nbsp;2 will run from&nbsp;April&nbsp;2023 to March 2025 and focus on the delivery of activities under each work package.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
