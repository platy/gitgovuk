<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) is aware of these <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>-accredited private-sector (non-NHS) providers who may be able to provide COVID-19 testing services.</p>

<p>These third-party providers have declared that they meet the government’s minimum standards for providers of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-to-release-for-international-travel-minimum-standards-for-testing" class="govuk-link">Test to Release for international travel</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-declare-as-a-private-sector-covid-19-testing-provider" class="govuk-link">minimum standards for private-sector providers of general COVID-19 testing</a> (the Declaration).</p>

<p>The government does not endorse or recommend any particular private test provider. Individuals and employers should conduct their own research about available providers and the tests they supply. Locations by region are included next to provider names in each list.</p>

<p>Individuals with coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate immediately and get an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace test</a> to check if they have coronavirus.</p>

<h2>General coronavirus testing</h2>

<p>General coronavirus testing is available to individuals for their specific coronavirus testing needs, as well as to employers who need support setting up and running their workforce testing operations.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/968844/covid-private-testing-providers-general-testing-120321.csv/preview">View the list of providers for general testing</a></p>
</div>

<p>Free NHS testing is for individuals with symptoms or who have been advised to take a test by a medical practitioner or public service. Individuals who do not fall into these 2 categories and require a test for other reasons, such as fit-to-fly, can contact providers from the general testing list to book a private coronavirus test at their own expense.</p>

<p>Employers should also use the general testing list if they wish to partner with an accredited third-party provider to provide workforce testing.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>Employers partnering with accredited providers can get free test kits for their organisation by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-workplace-coronavirus-tests?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">registering to order coronavirus tests for your employees</a> by 31 March.</p>
</div>

<p>For private-sector employers and third-party providers looking to set up their own workforce testing sites, please read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19): testing guidance for employers</a>.</p>

<h2>Test to Release for international travel</h2>

<p>The Test to Release scheme is not available to everyone. To find out if you can pay for a COVID-19 test to potentially reduce your self-isolation period after international travel, read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel" class="govuk-link">guidance on Test to Release</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p><a class="govuk-link" href="/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/968845/covid-private-testing-providers-test-to-release-120321.csv/preview">View the list of providers of Test to Release for international travel</a></p>
</div>

<p>There are different requirements for this scheme, which means that some providers for the general testing may not meet the minimum standards for Test to Release for international travel.</p>

<h2>Prospective testing providers</h2>

<p>Making the declaration is a mandatory requirement for providers with effect from 1 January 2021, or before providers begin testing (whichever is later).</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>For providers of the Test to Release for international travel, they must make the declaration before they begin testing.</p>
</div>

<p>If you are a private-sector provider who is able to offer testing services that meet the minimum standards, including being an applicant with <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>, you can request to be added to the list of providers by completing the declaration form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for <a href="https://support-covid-19-testing.dhsc.gov.uk/PrivateSectorSelfDeclaration" rel="external" class="govuk-link">providers of test to release for international travel</a>
</li>
  <li>for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-declare-as-a-private-sector-covid-19-testing-provider">other providers of general testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The 2 lists of providers are kept under review by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and are continually updated.</p>

<p>Private providers who want to provide a testing service are advised that they are clear with individuals and employers on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the benefits and drawbacks of testing</li>
  <li>how reliable the results will be, and what the limitations are</li>
  <li>what a test result means, in non-medical language</li>
  <li>how they are following the measures set out in this guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>Private providers should understand what legislation and regulations they will need to follow, including around data protection and patient confidentiality, and how they will meet these as required.</p>
