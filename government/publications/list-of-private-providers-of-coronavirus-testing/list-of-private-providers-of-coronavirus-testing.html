<p>You can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test">get a free NHS COVID-19 PCR test</a> if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/">coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms</a>
</li>
  <li>you’ve been advised to take a test by a medical practitioner or a government agency</li>
  <li>you’ve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re asymptomatic (you don’t have symptoms), you can <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing/regular-rapid-coronavirus-tests-if-you-do-not-have-symptoms/">get a free NHS COVID-19 LFD test</a>.</p>

<p>If you need a COVID-19 test for other reasons you must book and pay for it yourself using a private provider.</p>

<p>Reasons why you might want to use the services of a private provider could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for international travel – so you can enter another country, or after entering the UK from abroad</li>
  <li>if you’re an employer who wants to partner with a provider to offer testing to your staff</li>
</ul>

<h2>What private COVID-19 testing services are available</h2>

<p>Not all providers offer the same testing services. Before you look for a private provider, you’ll need to identify what testing service you need.</p>

<h3>Travel tests after arriving in England from abroad</h3>

<h4>Day 2 and day 8 tests</h4>

<p>You may need to take COVID-19 tests after entering England from abroad, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on or before day 2 only</li>
  <li>on or before day 2 and on or after day 8</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Check the testing requirements for entering England from abroad</a>.</p>

<p>There are different rules for people who’ve been in a country on the red list during the 10 days before they arrive.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19">Read an overview of the rules for travelling to England from abroad and find out who needs to take which tests</a>.</p>

<h4>Test to Release</h4>

<p>If you have to quarantine for 10 days after arriving in England, you may be able to choose to take a voluntary test on day 5 after arrival to see if you can end your quarantine early.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel">Read about the Test to Release scheme</a>.</p>

<h4>If you’re arriving in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland</h4>

<p>There are different rules. If you will be travelling on to Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man in the 10 days after you arrive in the UK, you must follow the rules for testing and quarantine in those places. Find out what you need to do if you’re:</p>

  <li><a rel="external" href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">travelling to Northern Ireland</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre-departure travel tests (‘fit to fly’)</h3>

<p>You may need proof of a negative COVID-19 test before travelling abroad. Providers often call these ‘fit to fly’ tests. The testing requirements are set by the country you want to travel to, and sometimes the airline you’re flying with.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="govuk-link">Check the FCDO travel advice pages to find out the testing requirements of the country you want to visit</a>.</p>

<h3>General population COVID-19 tests</h3>

<p>Some providers offer ‘general population’ COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic individuals who want to book and pay for their own test.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You cannot use these tests for your day 2 or day 8 test after international travel, or as part of the Test to Release scheme, because they have different minimum standards.</p>
</div>

<p>Depending on the type of test required by the country you want to travel to, you may be able to use general population COVID-19 tests for pre-departure tests when travelling abroad from England.</p>

<h2>How to choose a provider</h2>

<p>There are several steps to take and things to consider when arranging a private COVID-19 test.</p>

<h3>Find a provider</h3>

<p>Find a private provider offering the testing service you need.</p>

<p>You can use one of the provider lists on GOV.UK, or find one using your own research.</p>

<p>For example, employers could refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing">list of providers for general population COVID-19 testing</a> if they want to partner with a third-party provider undergoing <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation to provide workforce testing.</p>

<div class="application-notice info-notice" role="note" aria-label="Information">
<p>Private-sector employers and third-party providers looking to set up their own workforce testing site should read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-guidance-for-employers">COVID-19 testing guidance for employers</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>If your test is for travel purposes, your travel operator may be able to help you find a provider.</p>

<h3>Check the provider is listed on GOV.UK</h3>

<p>Make sure the provider is included in the GOV.UK list of providers for the testing service you need. This means the provider has been assessed against the government’s minimum standards by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>).</p>

<p>There are different minimum standards for different testing schemes – read more about minimum standards below.</p>

<h3>Check the provider’s terms and conditions</h3>

<p>Visit the provider’s website to check their terms and conditions, and other details about their service.</p>

<p>Things you’ll want to consider include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the cost of the test</li>
  <li>where and how you want to take the test – for example, a self-swab at home, or supervised at a test site</li>
  <li>how long you’ll have to wait to get test results</li>
</ul>

<p>Many providers send test kits by post or courier – you should leave enough time for your test kit to arrive. If you need an in-person test, check with providers directly whether this is possible.</p>

<p>Some airlines and travel operators offer discounts on travel tests – check their websites to find out more.</p>

<h3>Check consumer reviews for the provider</h3>

<p>You’ll need to carry out your own research to check the provider’s reputation. For example, use consumer review websites, or personal recommendations.</p>

<p>The government does not endorse, recommend or approve any private test provider.</p>

<h2>Minimum standards and <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation</h2>

<p>By law, all COVID-19 tests must meet certain minimum standards set by the government. Providers must also complete a declaration stating that their tests meet these standards.</p>

<p>Each scheme has different minimum standards, which means a test provider of asymptomatic COVID-19 testing may not meet the minimum standards for day 2 lateral flow tests for international testing and/or Test to Release for international arrivals and/or day 2 and 8 PCR testing for international arrivals.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation</h3>

<p>The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (<abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>) has been working with the government to assure the quality of private COVID-19 test providers. In December 2020 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> developed a 3-stage <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation process.</p>

<p>The providers listed on GOV.UK may be at various stages of the accreditation process. They may not have full accreditation. However, they will have shown compliance with the required minimum standards as they progress through the process.</p>

<p>Providers may be removed from the lists at any point if they’re found to be not complying with the minimum standards. This includes not meeting accreditation deadlines.</p>

<p>To find providers who have achieved full <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> accreditation, visit the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ukas.com/find-an-organisation/" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> website</a> – you can search by provider name, or the COVID-19 testing service they offer (sampling, POCT or laboratory-based PCR tests).</p>

<h2>Lists of providers published on GOV.UK</h2>

<p>We publish lists of and information about private providers who have had their self-declaration against the government’s minimum standards successfully assessed.</p>

<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1032748/covid-private-testing-providers-general-testing-111121.csv/preview" rel="external" class="govuk-link">See the list of providers of general population COVID-19 testing</a> – updated daily Monday to Friday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">See the list of providers of day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 testing</a>  – updated daily Monday to Friday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-travel-test-provider" class="govuk-link">See the list of providers of Test to Release testing</a> – updated daily Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>There is no separate list for providers offering pre-departure travel tests (‘fit to fly’) – read more about pre-departure travel tests, and how you can find providers offering the service you need .</p>

<div aria-label="Information" role="note" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>DHSC does not comment on commercial practices of specific companies or cases, neither do we endorse, recommend, or approve any private test provider. The providers on the GOV.UK list have demonstrated compliance with the relevant minimum standards for their commercial provision of testing. This includes applying for and being on their journey to achieving accreditation through the 3-stage UKAS accreditation process if they are providing sample collection and/or test analysis services.</p>
</div>

<h3>When providers get added to the list on GOV.UK</h3>

<p>Private providers are added to the GOV.UK list once their self-declaration has been successfully assessed against the government’s minimum standards for their provision of testing services by <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr>.</p>

<p>Not all providers have to be added to the list and can opt out of being published or choose to withdraw their listing from the relevant GOV.UK list. </p>

<p>If you’re a provider and want to be added to a list, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-become-a-private-provider-of-covid-19-testing" class="govuk-link">guidance for providers</a>.</p>

<h3>Why a provider might be removed from the list on GOV.UK</h3>

<p>Organisations may be taken off the lists if they’re found to be non-compliant with any of the minimum standards for the test service they’re providing, or when the <abbr title="United Kingdom Accreditation Service">UKAS</abbr> applicant is no longer meeting their accreditation deadlines. </p>

<p>Tests that have already been provided and/or taken remain valid if providers are removed from the list. Private providers will be instructed directly when they can no longer provide testing services.  </p>

<h2>How to report problems with private providers</h2>

<p>If you’ve had, or are having, a customer service issue with a private test provider, you should first report this back to the provider. They are the primary point of contact to help resolve your problem.</p>

<p>If the problem is not resolved, read our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/consumer-protection-rights" class="govuk-link">guidance on consumer rights</a>, including information on support available and useful contacts.</p>

<p>You can <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://enquiries.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/s/enquiries">make a complaint about a test provider</a>. This will help us to improve the service. We will not be able to contact a provider on your behalf. Problems with your tests such as the service received, a lack of test kits or late or no tests results should be raised with your provider in the first instance. </p>

<h2>What we are doing to protect consumers</h2>

<p>We monitor issues raised by the public and data submitted by the provider. We also get reports from other key regulatory and oversight bodies about providers. </p>

<p>If we become aware that a provider is not offering the high-quality service we expect, we may contact them to highlight our concerns and suggest ways they can improve.  </p>

<p>If we become aware that a provider is not meeting the required minimum standards, or that their activities may be putting public safety at risk, we’ll ask them to make improvements. We may also remove their listing from GOV.UK. </p>

<p>In certain circumstances, we’ll support regulatory bodies undertaking further investigation of a provider and support any legal actions or interventions.</p>

<p>Where a provider has been removed from the GOV.UK listings, they can ask to be reinstated to the list by providing evidence that they’ve remedied the problem which caused their removal.</p>

<p>We’ll look at the evidence they provide, and put them back into the relevant GOV.UK list if we’re satisfied that they can now deliver a high-quality service to consumers.</p>
