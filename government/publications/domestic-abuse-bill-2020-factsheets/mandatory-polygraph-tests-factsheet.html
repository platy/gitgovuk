<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We will commence a 3 year pilot of mandatory polygraph examinations on domestic abuse perpetrators released on licence identified as being at high risk of causing serious harm. A 3 year pilot will provide sufficient time to build up the necessary numbers of released offenders to conduct a robust evaluation.</li>
  <li>We have commissioned an independent body to independently evaluate the pilot.</li>
  <li>We will roll out a national project of    mandatory testing, subject to a positive evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">As head of the Sex Offender Management Unit for Greater Manchester Police, I endorse the use of polygraph testing as a mandatory licence condition by the National Probation Service (NPS) on high risk sex offenders. Under multi-agency public protection arrangements, the information gleaned through polygraph testing by NPS colleagues is shared with the police in order to better manage the risk posed by the individual, where there is joint agency responsibility. There have been a significant number of cases where information gained through polygraph testing has led to children and vulnerable people being safeguarded. Overall the benefits of polygraph allow our joint resources to better manage the risk posed by registered sex offenders, to concentrate on those who pose the most harm in our communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Jude Holmes, Public Protection and Serious Crime</p>

<h2>How are we going to do it?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Provisions in the Domestic Abuse Act enable the Secretary of State for Justice to     impose mandatory polygraph examinations on very-high and high risk domestic abuse perpetrators.</li>
  <li>We will commence a 3 year pilot testing domestic abuse perpetrators in 4 Probation Service areas.</li>
  <li>The legislation will require those who meet the eligibility criteria to take a polygraph test 3 months post release from custody and every 6 months thereafter, unless the test is failed. In such circumstances the offender will be required to take the test more frequently.</li>
  <li>We will appoint and train qualified Probation Officers, experienced in the         management of domestic abuse perpetrators to be qualified polygraph examiners.</li>
  <li>The Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing have been commissioned to      formally evaluate the pilot. The findings will be published and laid before Parliament.</li>
  <li>If the pilot is successful, we will roll out mandatory polygraph examinations to all high risk domestic abuse perpetrators in England and Wales.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Polygraph examinations have been successfully used in the management of people convicted of sexual offences since 2014 in the Probation Service. The Polygraph is used with those convicted of sexual offences released on licence. It works by measuring the physiological changes in the body when the individual being tested is asked certain questions. The polygraph instrument measures changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and sweat and the changes to the individualâs normal rates can indicate the subject is attempting to be deceptive.</p>

<p>Polygraph testing is used to monitor compliance with other licence conditions, for example, developing new relationships (that will otherwise will be self-reported), exclusion zones or contact with prohibited individuals.</p>

<p>They are also used to monitor dynamic risk factors, for example, consumption of alcohol or illegal substances (where related to offending).</p>

<p>Information obtained during testing is used by probation practitioners to refine and improve risk management plans.</p>

<h2>Which people on supervision will be subject to testing?</h2>

<p>Testing will be imposed on those offenders who are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aged 18 years and over.</li>
  <li>Assessed as very high or high risk of serious harm using nationally accredited risk         assessment tools.</li>
  <li>Convicted of one or more of the following  offences: murder, a specified violent offence, or breach of a restraining order where the offence involved domestic abuse; controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship.</li>
  <li>The individual is sentenced to a term of custody of 12 months or more and released on licence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Can individuals be Recalled to Custody for failing a polygraph examination?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>People on supervision subject to testing cannot be recalled to custody for failing a polygraph test, however they can be recalled for making disclosures during the test that reveal they have breached other licence conditions or that their risk has escalated to level whereby they can no longer be safely managed in the community.</li>
  <li>Those failing the test can, however, be tested more frequently and, in addition, they may be given a formal warning or made subject to additional licence conditions. Information gathered from a failed examination may be shared with the police who are able to conduct further investigations that may or may not result in charges being made.</li>
  <li>Offenders who attempt to âtrickâ the polygraph test, or who refuse to take it can be recalled to custody.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Are polygraph examinations accurate?</h2>

<p>Polygraph testing has been found to be 80-90% accurate.</p>

<h2>Who carries out polygraph examinations?</h2>

<p>Examinations are carried out by experienced qualified Probation Officers who have been trained as accredited examiners to the standards set by the American Polygraph Association (APA) and who are also         experienced in managing high risk individuals.</p>

<h2>Why bother with polygraph examinations if the results cannot be used as evidence in court or as the basis for recalling offenders to prison?</h2>

<p>Polygraph examinations are used as an    additional source of information for          probation practitioners supervising individuals.</p>

<p>There are sanctions for failing the tests or making adverse disclosures during the tests; for  example, increased reporting, the       imposition of additional licence conditions or increasing the frequency of testing. In       addition, the probation practitioners can change the focus of supervision in order to address the issues that relate to the failed questions.</p>

<h2>How well has mandatory polygraph testing worked with people convicted of sexual offences in the Probation Service?</h2>

<p>There is significant evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of polygraph testing. To date, over 5,000 tests have taken place with sexual  offenders, with 2/3 of those tests  resulting in significant disclosures.</p>

<h2>Can information from polygraph test be used in court?</h2>

<p>Information from the polygraph    cannot be used in Criminal Courts against the released individual (it may be used in civil courts at the discretion of the judge).</p>

<h2>Is there a risk that probation practitioners will use the polygraph test as a substitute to existing risk assessment?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Polygraph testing does not replace any    existing forms of risk  assessment or     management, more it provides an additional tool for  offender managers.</li>
  <li>Polygraph provides information for the      probation practitioners that s/he would not      otherwise have</li>
  <li>There is no evidence from the testing of  individuals convicted of sexual offences that the polygraph is used as a substitute for other forms of risk        assessment and management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case examples of polygraph testing with people convicted of sexual offences in the Probation Service?</h2>

<h3>J is a 47-year-old man convicted of the sexual abuse of young boys.</h3>

<p>He has a licence condition not to have contact with children under the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>J was subject to mandatory polygraph testing as part of his release following a 9 year custodial sentence.</p>

<p>During the polygraph examination he denied any contact with children under the age of 18 years. The test result indicated deception.</p>

<p>The polygraph examiner contacted the probation practitioner who immediately contacted the    police. The police were waiting for the offender when he returned to his property and found 3 young boys and another adult in the house.</p>

<p>J was immediately recalled to custody. The police were able to make further investigations.</p>

<h3>C is a 33-year-old man convicted of downloading and sharing indecent images of children.</h3>

<p>He has a licence condition not to possess any internet devices unless approved by his supervising officer.</p>

<p>C was subject to mandatory polygraph testing as part of his release licence following a 3 year custodial sentence.</p>

<p>During the polygraph pre-test phase he disclosed that he had a laptop, but that it was his motherâs and it was not internet enabled. He was then tested and asked âother than what you have already told me, do you have any internet enabled devicesâ. He replied ânoâ to the    question and deception was indicated. During the post test phase the examiner told him he had failed the question and asked if there was anything he would like to add. C said there was not.</p>

<p>The polygraph examiner notified the probation practitioner, who visited C at home with the police with a warrant.</p>

<p>The police discovered numerous phones, a laptop and several USB sticks containing indecent images of children.  C was immediately recalled to custody and charged.</p>
