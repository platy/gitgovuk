<p>The <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines available in the UK have been shown to be effective and to have a good safety profile. The early <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines do not contain organisms that can multiply in the body, so they cannot infect an unborn baby in the womb.</p>

<h2>Many vaccines can be given safely in pregnancy so why are you being advised against this vaccine?</h2>

<p>The vaccines have not yet been tested in pregnancy, so until more information is available, those who are pregnant should not routinely have this vaccine. Non-clinical evidence is required before any clinical studies in pregnancy can start, and before that, it is usual to not recommend routine vaccination during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Evidence from non-clinical studies of the Pfizer BioNTech, Astra-Zeneca and Moderna <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines has been reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>) and has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy.</p>

<p>Evidence on <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines has also been reviewed by the World Health Organization and the regulatory bodies in the US, Canada and Europe and has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) has recognised that the potential benefits of vaccination are particularly important for some pregnant women. This includes those who are at very high risk of catching the infection or those with clinical conditions that put them at high risk of suffering serious complications from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, you should discuss vaccination with your doctor or nurse, and you may feel that it is better to go ahead and receive the protection from the vaccine.</p>

<h2>Breastfeeding</h2>

<p>There are no data on the safety of <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines in breastfeeding or on the breastfed infant. Despite this, <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the benefits of breastfeeding are well known. Because of this, <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> has recommended that the vaccine can be received whilst breastfeeding. This is in line with recommendations in the US and from the World Health Organization.</p>

<h2>What this means for you</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant but think you are at high risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should discuss having or completing vaccination with your doctor or nurse</li>
  <li>although the vaccine has not been tested in pregnancy, you may decide that the known risks from <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> are so clear that you wish to go ahead with vaccination</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve had the first dose and then become pregnant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you should discuss having the second dose with your doctor or nurse</li>
  <li>you may choose to have the second dose or delay it until after the pregnancy is over</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no need to avoid pregnancy after <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccination.</p>
