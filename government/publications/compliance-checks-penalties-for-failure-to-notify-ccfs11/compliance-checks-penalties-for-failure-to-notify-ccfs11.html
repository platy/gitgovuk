<p>This factsheet contains information about the penalties we may charge where there has been a failure 
to notify.</p>

<p>This factsheet is one of a series. For the full list of the factsheets of this series, go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘Compliance checks factsheets’.</p>

<h2>If you need help</h2>

<p>If you have any health or personal circumstances that may make it difficult for you to deal with us, please tell the officer that’s contacted you. We’ll help you in whatever way we can. For more details, go to www.gov.uk/get-help-hmrc-extra-support</p>

<p>You can also ask someone else to deal with us on your behalf, for example, a professional adviser, friend or relative. We may however still need to talk or write to you directly about some things. If we need to write to you, we’ll send a copy to the person you’ve asked us to deal with. If we need to talk to you, they can be with you when we do, if you prefer.</p>

<h2>What is a failure to notify</h2>

<p>There are certain circumstances that affect your liability to tax that you must tell us about. You must do so within certain time limits. If you do not do this, we call this a ‘failure to notify’.</p>

<p>The circumstances that you must tell us about include when you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first become liable to pay tax</li>
  <li>either carry out, or intend to carry out a taxable activity that must be registered with us</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of when you first become liable to pay tax include when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your business exceeds the VAT registration threshold — you must tell us within 30 days of 
this happening</li>
  <li>the VAT supplies you make change — you must tell us within 30 days of this happening</li>
  <li>your company is chargeable to tax for an accounting period — if you’ve not been sent a notice to file a tax return, you must tell us within 12 months of the end of the accounting period</li>
  <li>your profits from self-employment first make you chargeable to tax — you must tell us within 6 months 
of the end of the relevant tax year</li>
  <li>you’ve no earned income but your investment income first reaches a level that makes you chargeable to tax — you must tell us within 6 months of the end of the relevant tax year</li>
  <li>you knowingly disposed of, or caused or permitted the disposal of material at an unauthorised waste site before 1 April 2018 where the material remained at the site on or after 1 April 2018 — you must have told us about the disposal before 1 May 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of when you either carry out, or intend to carry out, a taxable activity that must be registered with us include when you intend to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>promote bingo — you must register at least 14 days before the play starts</li>
  <li>brew beer — you must register with us at least 14 days before you intend to start brewing</li>
  <li>make available for play any amusement machines on which Machine Games Duty is payable — 
you must register with us at least 14 days before the machines are made available for play</li>
  <li>operate flights from the United Kingdom which are liable to Air Passenger Duty — you must register with us within 7 days of operating the first flight</li>
</ul>

<h2>Penalty for a failure to notify</h2>

<p>We may charge you a penalty if you fail to notify us, or do not notify us on time. If you ask someone else, such as an employee or adviser, to do something on your behalf, you must do as much as you can to make sure that a failure to notify does not occur. If you do not do this, we may charge you a penalty.</p>

<h2>When we will not charge you a penalty for a failure to notify</h2>

<p>We will not charge you a penalty for a failure to notify if all of the following apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you have a reasonable excuse for the failure</li>
  <li>the failure was not deliberate</li>
  <li>you told us without unreasonable delay after your reasonable excuse ended</li>
</ul>

<p>What we mean by ‘deliberate’ is explained later in this factsheet.</p>

<p>A reasonable excuse is something that stopped you from meeting a tax obligation on time which you took reasonable care to meet. It might be due to circumstances outside your control or a combination of events. Once the reasonable excuse has ended, you must put things right without any unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>Whether you have a reasonable excuse depends upon the particular circumstances of the failure to meet the obligation and your particular situation and abilities. This may mean that what is a reasonable excuse for one person may not be a reasonable excuse for someone else. If you think you have a reasonable excuse, please tell us. If we accept that you have a reasonable excuse, we will not charge you a penalty.</p>

<p>If there was anything about your health or personal circumstances that made it difficult for you to notify us of your liability to tax, please tell the officer that is carrying out the check. Telling them will mean that they can take this into account when considering whether you had a reasonable excuse.</p>

<p>For failure to notify disposals at unauthorised waste sites – we will not charge you a penalty unless your behaviour was deliberate.</p>

<h2>Disclosing a failure to notify before we find it</h2>

<p>If you tell us about a failure to notify before you had any reason to believe that we were about 
to find it, we call this an ‘unprompted disclosure’. If you tell us about a failure at any other time, 
we call it a ‘prompted disclosure’. Once we’ve started a check, a disclosure can only be 
unprompted if, exceptionally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it’s about a failure unrelated to what we’re checking</li>
  <li>you had no reason to believe that we could have found it during our check</li>
</ul>

<p>The minimum penalty for an unprompted disclosure is lower than the minimum penalty for 
a prompted one.</p>

<h2>What you can do to reduce any penalties we may charge you</h2>

<p>We can reduce the amount of any penalty we charge you depending on our view of how much assistance you gave us when you make a disclosure. We refer to this assistance as the ‘quality of disclosure’ or as ‘telling, helping and giving’.</p>

<p>Examples of telling, helping and giving include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>telling us about, or agreeing that there’s a failure and how and why it happened</li>
  <li>telling us everything you can about the extent of the failure as soon as you know about it</li>
  <li>telling and helping us by answering our questions in full</li>
  <li>helping us to understand your accounts or records</li>
  <li>helping us by replying to our letters quickly</li>
  <li>helping us by agreeing to attend any meetings, or visits, at a mutually convenient time</li>
  <li>helping us by checking your own records to identify the extent of the failure</li>
  <li>giving us access to documents we’ve asked for without unnecessary delay</li>
  <li>giving us access to documents we may not know about, as well as those that we ask to see</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll reduce the penalty by the maximum amount possible if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tell us everything you can about any wrongdoing as soon as you can</li>
  <li>do everything you can to help us correct it</li>
</ul>

<p>If you delay in making a disclosure, you may still be entitled to a reduction, but it will be smaller. If we do not need any extra assistance from you, we’ll give you some reduction for telling, helping and giving.</p>

<h2>Letting us know about any special circumstances</h2>

<p>If there are any special circumstances that you believe the officer dealing with the check should take into consideration when working out the penalty, you should let them know straightaway.</p>

<h2>How we work out the amount of a penalty</h2>

<p>There are 8 stages in working out the amount of any penalty. Each stage is explained in more detail on page 3 of this factsheet.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1 Working </span> out the amount of the potential lost revenue (<abbr title="potential lost revenue">PLR</abbr>)</h3>

<p>The penalty is a percentage of what we call the ‘potential lost revenue’. Potential lost revenue (<abbr title="potential lost revenue">PLR</abbr>) is the amount that arises as a result of the failure to notify. The officer dealing with the check will explain how we work this out.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2 Determining </span> our view of the ‘behaviour’</h3>

<p>When there’s a failure to notify, we’ll work with you to find out what caused it. We refer to this as the ‘behaviour’. The type of behaviour will affect whether we charge you a penalty and the amount of the penalty. The 3 different types of behaviour are described below.</p>

<h4>Non-deliberate</h4>

<p>This is where you failed to tell us about a circumstance that affected your liability to tax within the relevant time limit, but the failure was not deliberate or deliberate and concealed.</p>

<h4>Deliberate but not concealed</h4>

<p>This is where you knew that you should have told us about a circumstance that affected your liability to tax within the relevant time limit, but you chose not to tell us.</p>

<h4>Deliberate and concealed</h4>

<p>This is where you knew that you should have told us about a circumstance that affected your liability to tax within the relevant time limit, but you chose not to tell us. As well as choosing not to tell us, you also took active steps to hide the failure to notify from us.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3 Deciding </span> whether the disclosure was unprompted or prompted</h3>

<p>This determines the minimum penalty percentage that we can charge you. The section titled ‘Disclosing 
a failure to notify before we find it’, on page 2 of this factsheet, explains this in more detail.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4 The </span> penalty ranges</h3>

<p>The penalty percentage will fall within a range. This range will depend on our view of the type of behaviour and whether the disclosure was unprompted or prompted. The following table shows the penalty ranges.</p>

      <td>0% to 30%<br><br>10% to 30%<br><br>10% to 30%<br><br>20% to 30%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Deliberate</td>

      <td>Unprompted<br><br><br>Prompted</td>
      <td>30% to 100%<br><br>50% to 100%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you have a reasonable excuse for a non-deliberate failure to notify, we will not charge you a penalty.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5 Working </span> out the reductions for the quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving)</h3>

<p>The quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving) determines where the penalty will fall within the penalty range. The reduction we give depends on how much assistance you give us. For:</p>

<ul>
  <li>telling we give up to 30%</li>
  <li>helping we give up to 40%</li>
  <li>giving access to records we give up to 30%</li>
</ul>

<p>When we work out the quality of disclosure, we’ll also consider how long it’s taken you to disclose the failure to notify. If it’s taken you a long time (such as 3 years or more) to make a disclosure, we’ll usually restrict the maximum reduction we give for the quality of disclosure to 10 percentage points above the minimum of the penalty range. This means you will not benefit from the lowest penalty percentage that’s normally available.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6 Working </span> out the penalty percentage rate</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>During a compliance check, we found a non-deliberate failure to notify that the customer had not told us about before we started our check. When we told them about the failure, they agreed with us that there had been a failure. This was therefore a prompted disclosure. The failure occurred more than 12 months after the tax became due.</p>

<p>The penalty range for a non-deliberate failure to notify with a prompted disclosure more than 12 months after the tax was due is 20% to 30% of the ‘potential lost revenue’ (PLR).</p>

<p>The reduction for quality of disclosure (telling, helping and giving) was 70%.</p>

</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">7 Working </span> out the amount of the penalty</h3>

<p>To work out the amount of the penalty, we multiply the <abbr title="potential lost revenue">PLR</abbr> by the penalty percentage rate. For example, if the <abbr title="potential lost revenue">PLR</abbr> in the example above was £3,000, and there were no other reductions, the penalty would be £690 (£3,000 x 23% = £690).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8 Considering </span> other reductions</h3>

<p>After working out the amount of the penalty, we then consider any other reductions that are necessary. For example, where we’ve already charged another penalty on the same tax or duty.</p>

<p>This then gives the amount of penalty that we’ll charge.</p>

<h2>How we tell you about a penalty</h2>

<p>We’ll write to tell you how much the penalty is and how we’ve worked it out. If there’s anything about the penalty that you do not agree with, or if you think there is any information we’ve not already considered, you should tell us straightaway. After taking account of anything you’ve told us, we’ll then either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send you a penalty assessment notice</li>
  <li>invite you to enter into a contract with us to pay the penalty, together with the tax and interest</li>
</ul>

<p>In certain circumstances you may also have to pay interest on the penalty if you do not pay it on time.</p>

<h2>Paying some or all of a company’s penalty for deliberate failure to notify</h2>

<p>A company officer may have to pay some or all of the company’s penalty if the penalty is due to their actions, and one or more of the following applies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they have gained, or attempted to gain, personally from a deliberate inaccuracy</li>
  <li>the company is, or we believe it’s about to become insolvent — even if the officer did not gain personally from the deliberate inaccuracy</li>
</ul>

<p>If the company pays the penalty, we will not ask the individual officers to pay.</p>

<p>A company officer is a director, shadow director, company secretary or manager of a company, 
or a member of a limited liability partnership.</p>

<h2>If you’ve deliberately done something wrong</h2>

<p>We may carry out a criminal investigation with a view to prosecution if you’ve deliberately done something wrong, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>given us information that you know is not true, whether verbally or in a document</li>
  <li>dishonestly misrepresented how much tax you owe, or claimed payments you’re not entitled to</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing serious defaulters</h3>

<p>If you deliberately got your tax affairs wrong, and we find this during the check, we may monitor your tax affairs more closely. We have an enhanced monitoring programme called ‘managing serious defaulters. For more information, read factsheet CC/FS14, ‘Managing serious defaulters’. Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘CC/FS14’.</p>

<h3>Publishing details of deliberate defaulters</h3>

<p>We may publish your details if you deliberately got your tax affairs wrong, but we’ll not do this if we’ve given you the maximum penalty reduction. For more information, read factsheet CC/FS13, ‘Publishing details of deliberate defaulters’. Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘CC/FS13’.</p>

<h2>If you disagree</h2>

<p>Please tell us if there’s anything you disagree with.</p>

<p>If we make a decision that you can appeal against, we’ll write to you about the decision and tell you what to do if you disagree. You’ll usually have 3 options. Within 30 days, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>send new information to the officer dealing with the check and ask them to take it into account</li>
  <li>have your case reviewed by an HMRC officer who has not been involved in the matter</li>
  <li>arrange for an independent tribunal to hear your appeal and decide the matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever you choose, you may also be able to ask for an HMRC specialist officer to act as a neutral facilitator to help resolve the dispute. We call this Alternative Dispute Resolution (<abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr>).</p>

<p><abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr> is only available for disputes that relate to particular tax areas. The officer dealing with the check 
will tell you if <abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr> is available for your dispute. For more information about appeals and <abbr title="Alternative Dispute Resolution">ADR</abbr>, read factsheets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HMRC1, ‘HM Revenue and Customs decisions — what to do if you disagree’</li>
  <li>CC/FS21, ‘Alternative dispute resolution’</li>
</ul>

<p>Go to www.gov.uk and search for ‘HMRC1’ or ‘CC/FS21’.</p>

<h2>Your rights when we’re considering penalties</h2>

<p>The European Convention on Human Rights gives you certain important rights. If we’re considering penalties, we’ll tell you. We’ll also tell you that these rights apply and ask you to confirm that you understand them. These rights are that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if we ask you any questions to help us decide whether to charge you a penalty, you have the right 
not to answer them — the amount of help that you give us when we’re considering penalties is entirely 
a matter for you to decide</li>
  <li>when deciding whether to answer our questions, you may want to get advice from a professional adviser — particularly if you do not already have one</li>
  <li>if you disagree with us about the tax or any penalties we believe are due, you can appeal — if you appeal about both tax and penalties, you’ve the right to ask for both appeals to be considered together</li>
  <li>you’ve the right to apply for funded legal assistance for dealing with any appeal against certain penalties</li>
  <li>you’re entitled to have the matter of penalties dealt with without unreasonable delay</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find full details about these rights in factsheet CC/FS9 ‘The Human Rights Act and penalties’. 
Go to www.gov.uk and search ‘CC/FS9’.</p>
