    <p>New controls on antique firearms were introduced in the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/215/contents/made">Antique Firearms Regulations 2021</a> (“the 2021 Regulations”) which came into effect on 22 March 2021.  The new controls and relevant transitional provisions were set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0012021-antique-firearms">Home Office Circular 001/2021: Antique firearms</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This circular sets out amendments to the 2021 Regulations made by <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/1381/made">The Antique Firearms (Amendment) Regulations 2021</a> (“the Amendment Regulations”) which come into effect on 28 December 2021.  The Amendment Regulations correct an omission from the 2021 Regulations by adding to paragraph 5 of the Schedule (cartridges for vintage rifles, punt guns and shot guns) “cartridges with bores greater than 10”. The Amendment Regulations also make a number of minor and typographical corrections to the descriptions of other cartridges specified in the Schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To ensure that owners affected by this omission remained in lawful possession of their firearms while the Amendment Regulations were approved by Parliament and brought into effect, the Government extended the transition period in respect of the omitted firearms until 22 January 2022.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the owners of these firearms will not require a firearm certificate to possess them once the Amendment Regulations come into effect on 28 December, the way in which the transitional provisions for the 2021 Regulations were drafted meant that owners of the omitted firearms were asked to lodge an application for a certificate with their local police force before the end of the extended transition period, otherwise they could technically commit a historic offence of unlawful possession.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the Amendment Regulations coming into effect on 28 December, police forces will be able to cancel any such applications they have received.</p>
