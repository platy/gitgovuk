<p>You need a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/health-certificates-for-animal-and-animal-product-imports-to-great-britain">health certificate</a> to export live animal and animal products to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), the Channel Islands or Isle of Man.</p>

<p>This guide is for exporters sending animals or animal products to Great Britain and explains how to fill in a health certificate.
Read guidance on rules to follow for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-or-moving-live-animals-animal-products-and-high-risk-food-and-feed-not-of-animal-origin">importing animals and animal products to Great Britain</a>.</p>

<p>In this guide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‘<abbr title="international standard 2-letter country code for a country">ISO</abbr>’ means the international standard <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html" rel="external">2-letter country code</a> for a country</li>
  <li>Great Britain refers to England, Scotland, Wales, Channel Islands and Isle of Man</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual health certificates vary according to the consignments.</p>

<p>The certificate tells you if a field is compulsory or optional.</p>

<p>After the certificate has been issued, the operator responsible for the consignment must tell the competent authority in Great Britain if there is any change to the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>consignee</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-border-control-posts-animal-and-animal-product-imports">entry border control post (<abbr title="border control post">BCP</abbr>)</a></li>
  <li>date of transport</li>
  <li>means of transport</li>
</ul>

<p>You will not get a replacement certificate for these changes. The competent authority will tell you what to do next.</p>

<p>The certificates are only valid for imports into Great Britain. There are 2 sets of certificates for each commodity type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>countries subject to the transitional import arrangements (includes EU member states)</li>
  <li>countries not subject to the transitional import arrangements (includes non-EU countries)</li>
</ul>

<p>The ‘Notes’ section on the certificate explains which country the certificate applies to.</p>

<p>References to European Union legislation within this guide are to direct EU legislation which has been retained in Great Britain (retained EU law as defined in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).</p>
