<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This document lays out the Mandate for the Public Sector Fraud Authority. It details how it works within government, what it wants the mandate to do, what its responsibilities are and the responsibilities of ministerial departments and public bodies when engaging with it.</p>

<p>This document should be used by the PSFA and ministerial departments and public bodies as a reference point on how they interact with each other.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Public Sector Fraud Authority is the UK government’s Centre of Expertise for the management of fraud (and associated error) against the public sector. It leads the Government’s Counter Fraud Function, which brings together the c.16,000 people who work in ministerial departments and public bodies to fight fraud. The standards and guidance that the Function creates, led from the PSFA, must be used in central government, and can be used more widely in the public sector and beyond, to improve the robustness of how we understand, prevent and respond to fraud. The PSFA sits at the heart of government, reporting to HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office; sharing best practice across the public sector including devolved administrations and local governments.</p>

<p>Fraud covers fraud, bribery and corruption and associated loss from error<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. To manage fraud on a volume basis it is most efficient to manage and scrutinise fraud and error (rather than to focus exclusively on areas where the intent of the perpetrator has been established). Public sector fraud and error loss is estimated to be at least £33bn a year. Fraud against the public sector increases the cost of public services and understanding, finding and reducing it is an essential part of government efficiency.</p>

<p>Every pound of taxpayers’ money saved in fighting fraud is a pound invested in our public services or back in the pocket of the taxpayers we serve, and a pound less in the pocket of criminals.</p>

<h2>i. Public Sector Fraud Authority’s Mission</h2>

<p>The government has created the Public Sector Fraud Authority to transform the way that the government manages fraud. This will build on the progress made by the Counter Fraud Function.</p>

<p>Its mission will be to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modernise the fraud and error response by widening access, and use of, leading practices, tools and technology - better protecting taxpayers money.</li>
  <li>Build expert-led services that collaborate with experts in departments and public bodies to better fight fraud and error through risk, prevention, data and enforcement techniques</li>
  <li>Develop capability in the public sector to find, prevent and respond to fraud and error - both organisationally and individually</li>
  <li>Put performance at the heart of the public sector fraud conversation - focusing on investments and outcomes</li>
  <li>Be seen as a beacon of fraud and error expertise and a destination for those wanting to make a difference in fighting public sector fraud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ii. Public Sector Fraud Authority’s Mandate</h2>

<p>The PSFA’s mandate has been agreed by Ministers and Senior Officials.</p>

<p>The principles that underlie this Mandate are that the Public Sector Fraud Authority:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will be expert led</li>
  <li>Will have processes that are mandatory - not discretionary</li>
  <li>Will be instrumental in change - showing a path to success not just keeping score</li>
  <li>Will have the full authority of Cabinet Office and HM Treasury behind it</li>
  <li>Will be integrated into HM Treasury (including Spending Teams) and consulted at all major decision points</li>
</ul>

<p>The Mandate contains a General Mandate (listed in this section), and an Annex (Annex A) containing more detail on the individual functions of the PSFA and their responsibilities (and the corresponding responsibilities for ministerial departments and public bodies).</p>

<h2>a. General Mandate</h2>

<h3>The Public Sector Fraud Authority</h3>

<p>1 - The Public Sector Fraud Authority will be the government’s Centre of Expertise on the management of public sector fraud.</p>

<p>2 - The PSFA will be the authoritative voice within government on the extent of the risk and threat of fraud across the public sector and the government’s overall performance in dealing with it.</p>

<p>3 - The PSFA will be focused on ministerial departments and public bodies<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, but it will share practices and make available standards to the wider public sector<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>4 - The PSFA will be the centre of the government’s Counter Fraud Function, bringing together the expertise of those who work to find and fight fraud and reduce error across government.</p>

<p>5 - The PSFA will openly and regularly update on its activities and the data it holds to the National Audit Office (NAO). This will include performance data and the compliance with mandatory processes and data requests.<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup></p>

<p>6 - The PSFA will produce an Annual Report that makes transparent the levels of fraud in government and the latest fraud and error evidence base. It will also produce an Annual Report on the PSFA’s performance.</p>

<h3>Mandatory Processes</h3>

<p>7 - The PSFA will have mandatory processes for ministerial departments and public bodies. These are:</p>

<p>a. The use of Initial Fraud Impact Assessments during the design phase pre-announcement in significant areas of new spend (in line with Managing Public Money and the Green Book);</p>

<p>b. The submission of quarterly performance data on levels of fraud and error (as defined by the PSFA) and progress against Action Plans and Metrics;</p>

<p>c. The use of, and assurance against<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[footnote 5]</a></sup>, the Counter Fraud Functional Standard</p>

<p>d. Agreement of annual action plans and metrics on fraud management.</p>

<p>8 - Where the mandatory processes are not followed, this will be recorded.</p>

<p>9 - Where the PSFA and HM Treasury consider the introduction of further mandatory processes, this will be consulted on with the Chief Operating Officers network and the Finance Leaders Board and agreed with Ministers.</p>

<h3>PSFA Functions</h3>

<p>10 - The PSFA will oversee the performance of ministerial departments’ and public bodies in understanding and taking action on fraud against the public sector.</p>

<p>11 - The PSFA will carry out targeted reviews of areas of fraud threat and targeted quality reviews of fraud activities. These will produce recommendations for the PSFA and public bodies.</p>

<p>12 - The PSFA will develop the capability of public servants in dealing with fraud through the Counter Fraud Profession. This will cover both those working to fight fraud against the public sector and wider fraud (due to the common skillset). It will develop a licence-to-operate model for those working in fraud roles.</p>

<h3>Oversight of Risk</h3>

<p>13 - The PSFA will create and maintain a Global Fraud Risk Assessment, that looks at fraud risk across government.</p>

<p>14 - The PSFA will develop a High Fraud Risk Portfolio (HFRP) which lays out the highest risk areas of spending, and the capability that is in place to deal with them.</p>

<p>15 - The PSFA and HM Treasury will have the final decision on which areas of spending are part of the HFRP.</p>

<h3>PSFA Services</h3>

<p>16 - The PSFA will provide services to ministerial departments and public bodies to assist their own counter fraud resources in the delivery of specialist fraud activity. These services will not be a replacement for the public bodies own fraud function. The PSFA’s services are listed in Annex A of this document.</p>

<p>17 - The PSFA will adopt a triaging process to determine where it provides support to public bodies.</p>

<p>18 - The PSFA will continually review its services for effectiveness, working closely with its Advisory Panel.</p>

<h3>Corporate Governance</h3>

<p>19 - The PSFA will be led by a CEO, who will be a recognised expert in the management and control of fraud losses.</p>

<p>20 - The PSFA CEO will directly brief Cabinet Office and HM Treasury Ministers.</p>

<p>21 - In briefing ministers, the PSFA will work with CO and HMT officials. As per standard practice, HMT will be responsible for advising on the formal spending approvals for policy, as set out in the spending framework. The PSFA will advise on the risk of fraud, potential actions to mitigate and the deliverability of counter fraud initiatives.</p>

<p>22 - The PSFA leadership team will be supported by an Advisory Panel of recognised experts on fraud management from different sectors. This Advisory Panel will be independent.</p>

<p>23- The members of the Advisory Panel will be appointed by a Cabinet Office Minister.</p>

<h3>Public Bodies and the PSFA</h3>

<p>24 - The responsibility for managing the risk of fraud within government spending and schemes will remain with the public body and Accounting Officer where that spending and scheme is based, with real time oversight by the PSFA.</p>

<p>25 - In line with Managing Public Money and the Counter Fraud Functional Standard, public bodies must build and maintain their own counter fraud functions, aligned to the level of risk that they face. They should not rely on the PSFA to provide essential services, but rather use it to supplement their own capability where they are immature or want to push further.</p>

<p>26 - Ministerial departments and public bodies will develop investment/business cases to take further action on fraud. Alongside this, the PSFA will work with public bodies to develop cross system cases where there is an opportunity.</p>

<p>27 - Ministerial departments and public bodies must engage with the PSFA, make use of the guidance and tools that it provides, take account of the Practice Standards and the Professional Standards of the Counter Fraud Profession when undertaking counter fraud work and recruiting counter fraud roles.</p>

<p>28 - The PSFA will adapt its approach according to the level of risk ministerial departments and public bodies are managing and their size.</p>

<p>29 - The PSFA will limit its requests, as far as possible, to standard quarterly returns. The exception will be urgent/important issues of fraud control and response. These will be recorded.</p>

<p>30 - Where the PSFA makes requests of ministerial departments and public bodies for information on an urgent/important issue these requests should be complied with in a timely manner, and recorded if they are not.</p>

<p>31 - Ministerial department and public body Fraud Risk and Threat Assessments will be openly shared with the PSFA, but will not be shared further without express permission of the originating organisation (other than the NAO and relevant PAC), they must not be unreasonably withheld.</p>

<p>32 - The PSFA will proactively share its data on performance and compliance with mandatory processes with the ministerial departments and public bodies it relates to.</p>

<p>33 - Where PSFA processes are either not complied with and / or recommendations not accepted / implemented there should be a clear outcome.</p>

<p>34 - The PSFA will agree MoUs with DWP and HMRC. This is an exception in light of their size and the extent of their counter fraud operations.</p>

<h2>iii. Integration with HM Treasury and Cabinet Office</h2>

<p>Below are some key aspects of the relationship on the integration of the PSFA with HM Treasury and the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p>35 - The PSFA will have the convening power to bring together expertise from across the public sector to define leading practice, scrutinise key fraud issues and develop solutions to cross-cutting problems.</p>

<p>36 - The PSFA and HM Treasury will be able to take action where there are concerns in how fraud is being managed through scrutiny at the Efficiency and Value for Money Committee, and advising Ministers on applying conditions on funding from HM Treasury.</p>

<p>37 -  The PSFA will have a formal role in HM Treasury approval points in relation to programmes or policies with a significant fraud risk or the development of counter-fraud programmes or policies where possible. The PSFA should be included at the outset in such scenarios and where this is not possible, there should be a clear rationale as to why not and there should be clear accountability on decision making. Where they are not involved at the outset, the PSFA will be brought in at a later stage. The PSFA’s role, and the point at which it is involved (and if it is not), will be recorded.</p>

<p>38 - The PSFA will provide expert advice to HM Treasury and Cabinet Office Ministers and Senior Officials on fraud risk and threat, and the performance of the public sector in responding to it.</p>

<p>39 - The PSFA will work closely with HM Treasury to, where possible, review all business cases and investment bids for funding on initiatives for countering fraud to consider their effectiveness and deliverability.</p>

<p>40 - Where the PSFA is working with HM Treasury and Cabinet Office to take action on an area of concern, a joint position will be reached on how to take action. Where a joint position is not reached, this will be recorded.</p>
