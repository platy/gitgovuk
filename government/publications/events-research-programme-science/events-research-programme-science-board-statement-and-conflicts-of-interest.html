<h2>Science Statement</h2>

<p>Below is a summary of the evidence likely to be generated by the ERP by the end of Phase I.</p>

<p>1. At current levels of prevalence, very large numbers of attendees and comparable comparison groups would be required in order to estimate epidemiologically meaningful differences in risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across event types and mitigation measures (Science Framework 16.03.21).</p>

<p>2. The initial events within the Events Research Programme (ERP) are currently insufficient in scale, scope and study designs to generate any direct evidence based on transmission data on how opening events might be done to mitigate risks of transmission, by the end of Phase I.</p>

<p>3. The initial events within ERP will, however, provide evidence on the potential effectiveness of i. ventilation systems, assessed using CO2 measurements as a proxy for flow rate per person; and ii. organisation of events and venue design assessed using video footage of attendee behaviour (see 5c below).</p>

<p>4. By pooling data across events, the ERP might provide an indication of risk of transmission by comparing rates of infection in attendees post-event, with rates of infection based on surveillance data in similar populations.</p>

<p>Any such estimate will be extremely tentative given (a) none of the planned studies includes a comparison group and (b) post-event test results may only be available on a small and unrepresentative sample of attendees.</p>

<p>5. The ERP will generate important evidence to inform a further phase of the ERP in which direct evidence of mitigating transmission could be generated including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>feasibility and acceptability of pre- and post-event testing, including:
    <ul>
      <li>proportion (and demographic representativeness) of those expressing interest in attending an event who undergo testing and attend;</li>
      <li>proportion of those attending who return a post-event test kit (and demographic representativeness)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>impact of incentives on post-event test return rates</p>
  </li>
  <li>feasibility of using video footage to measure attendees’ behaviour at events:
    <ul>
      <li>movement (to estimate aerobic levels)</li>
      <li>interpersonal distances and interactions</li>
      <li>wearing of face coverings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The evidence generated by ERP will be supplemented by results from an ongoing rapid review of evidence, being undertaken by PHE, and by summaries of mass gatherings, prepared by the International Comparators Joint Unit, FCDO.</p>
