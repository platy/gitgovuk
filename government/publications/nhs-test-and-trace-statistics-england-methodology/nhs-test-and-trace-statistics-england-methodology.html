<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (<abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>) publishes weekly statistics on NHS Test and Trace (England). This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics for testing and contact tracing in England. These statistics cover:</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace bulletin, England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of people tested for coronavirus (COVID-19) in England</li>
  <li>number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in England</li>
  <li>time taken for test results to become available in England</li>
  <li>distance to take a test in-person in England</li>
  <li>number of people testing positive for COVID-19 in England that were then transferred to the contact-tracing system, and the time taken for them to be reached</li>
  <li>number of recent close contacts identified, and the time taken for them to be reached</li>
  <li>number of people starting their quarantine at home or in a managed quarantine hotel</li>
  <li>number of successful claims on the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>Rapid asymptomatic testing bulletin, England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests and confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests conducted by test result</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted linked to education settings</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care homes</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted by NHS staff</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in private and public sector workplaces</li>
</ul>

<p>This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics for testing and contact tracing in England.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is consolidating where COVID-19 testing statistics are published to make it easier to find the latest data. From 17 December 2020, this publication no longer includes information on COVID-19 testing in the UK. This information can instead be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" rel="external">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>. Statistics on positive cases are published daily on the dashboard and weekly in the NHS Test and Trace publication.</p>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several important aspects of the <a href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> and regards them as consistent with the code’s 3 pillars of trustworthiness, quality and value.</p>

<h2>NHS Test and Trace, England</h2>

<p>This section covers the methodology for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace statistical bulletin</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace data tables</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace regional breakdowns</li>
  <li>demographic and regional information for people tested and testing positive</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and the rapid asymptomatic testing bulletin see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#tests-conducted-england">Tests conducted, England</a> section below.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace in England was launched on 28 May 2020 and ensures that anyone who develops symptoms of COVID-19 can quickly be tested to find out if they have the virus. It then helps trace recent close contacts of anyone who tests positives for COVID-19 and, if necessary, notifies them that they must self-isolate at home to help stop the spread of the virus. The flow of how people move through the NHS Test and Trace service is shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-1">figure 1</a>. More information about NHS Test and Trace can be found in the guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace: how it works</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> publishes weekly statistics on NHS Test and Trace. The purpose of this data is to provide a weekly update on the implementation and performance of NHS Test and Trace. Data collected for the Test and Trace programme is primarily for operational purposes and was not designed to track the spread of the virus. Studies into the spread of the virus in the UK are carried out by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>). Further guidance can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comparing-methods-used-in-the-covid-19-infection-survey-and-nhs-test-and-trace-england--2">comparing methods used in the COVID-19 Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace, England</a>.</p>

<p>A list of data sources relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-statistics-and-analysis">COVID-19 statistics and analysis</a>. A breakdown of all available testing and contact-tracing data in the UK can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-and-contact-tracing-in-the-uk-summary-of-data">testing and contact tracing in the UK: summary of data</a>.</p>

<h4>Figure 1: flowchart showing how people move through NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/124328/figure-1-flowchart-through-nhs-test-and-trace.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>The diagram shows the journey a person can take through NHS Test and Trace. This can start with either an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> COVID-19 test or a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> COVID-19 test.</p>

<p>For those taking <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, they can collect their test from their workplace, place of education, pharmacy or local/mobile test site. They can also order an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test to be delivered to their home.  All people who test positive from an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> are transferred to contact tracing, however if their confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is negative, they and their contacts are removed from contact tracing.</p>

<p>All those testing positive from an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test are instructed to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. In addition, symptomatic individuals and some other use cases can directly book a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test without taking an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test first. <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests may also be taken in hospital or outbreak locations or as part of a prevalence study. Booked <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can either be conducted at a regional test site, local test site or mobile test unit; or a satellite or home test can be conducted. After tests have been taken, they are sent to a laboratory for processing. Once processed, a person will be emailed or texted their result.</p>

<p>If a person has a positive COVID-19 test result, then their case is transferred to NHS Test and Trace and can be managed in one of 2 ways. First, cases that are not managed by local health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) are reached either online or by a call centre. They are then asked to provide details of recent close contacts. These recent close contacts are then reached by NHS Test and Trace and advised to self-isolate. Second, cases that are linked to certain exposure settings are escalated to local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> who work to identify and reach recent close contacts and advise them to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the person has the app and used the app to book their test, their positive result is updated automatically. If they have the app but booked their test via a different route, then they can use a link to add their positive result to the app. Once their positive result is entered into the app, the person is asked if they are willing to share their data and if they say yes, the app identifies other app users who have been in close contact with the person who has tested positive. Close contacts then receive an app notification to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Between 27 January 2021 and 29 March 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing was temporarily removed for positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken at general public test sites due to the high level of COVID-19 infections in England. During this period, a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result triggered the start of contact tracing.</p>

<p>From 30 March 2021, the requirement to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. A positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result will continue to trigger contact tracing; however, NHS Test and Trace has introduced improvements to automatically inform anyone self-isolating from a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> to stop isolating if the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is taken promptly and is negative. These individuals will then be removed from contact tracing.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>NHS Test and Trace is for England only. Therefore, the figures in this section are given for England only. Similar programmes are in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but this data is not part of the NHS Test and Trace programme and is owned and managed by Public Health Scotland, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency respectively. Information is available at their statistics release pages: <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/">Test and Protect in Scotland</a>; <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-contact-tracing-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Test, Trace, Protect in Wales</a>; and <a rel="external" href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-tracing-covid-19/contact-tracing-service-management-information" class="govuk-link">Contact tracing in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>This data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. The different data streams are collated centrally by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. Testing data is also collected by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> (formerly Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>)) and the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is taken from data collected and stored by commercial partners.</p>

<h3>Timings and revisions</h3>

<p>Figures given in previous releases are routinely revised each week going back to the start of Test and Trace.</p>

<p>The figures presented are based on a data cut taken several days after the end of the reporting period. This is to give time for data relating to the end of the 7-day period to be collected. Some data may continue to be collected after this period, and therefore may need to be revised over time.</p>

<h3>Time series</h3>
<p>Data is released as a time series of weekly data that is updated each week. Historic data may be revised if more accurate information is available later (see <a href="#timings" class="govuk-link">Timings and revisions</a> above). This means that individual figures will not necessarily align with what was published earlier on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Testing in England</h3>
<p>NHS Test and Trace starts with an individual taking a swab test, either in pillar 1, pillar 2 or pillar 4. Those who go on to test positive<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup> will have their case transferred to NHS Test and Trace for contact tracing. The majority of these are people who were tested under pillar 1 or pillar 2 of the government testing strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pillar 1: swab testing for the virus in <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes" class="govuk-link">pillar 2</a>: swab testing for the virus in the wider population, through commercial partnerships, either processed in a lab or more rapidly via <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</li>
  <li>pillar 3 testing: serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19</li>
  <li>pillar 4 testing: blood and swab testing for national surveillance supported by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and research, academic and scientific partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, more information is available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-surveillance">COVID-19 surveillance</a> guidance<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several different types of COVID-19 tests available including <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. Details on each type of test are given in <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-coronavirus-testing">Types of COVID-19 testing</a> in the section for <a href="#tests-conducted-england" class="govuk-link">Tests conducted, England</a> below.</p>

<p>It is a legal requirement that all positive cases are reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, irrespective of pillar or test type. As such, when pillar 4 research studies (for swab testing) identify positive cases, <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> is notified and this data flows into the Surveillance system. This means that currently all positive cases identified by pillar 4 surveillance studies are captured under pillar 1 or 2 and are transferred to NHS Test and Trace. The same applies to those tested as part of the volunteer testing network: they are reported to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> under pillar 1 and any positive cases are transferred to NHS Test and Trace. Pillar 3 (serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19) are not transferred to NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>Once conducted, tests are processed and the results are sent back to the individual through an email or an SMS.</p>

<p>Between 30 November 2020 and 26 January 2021, anyone who received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result was instructed to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. The individual and their household were advised to self-isolate from the point of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result being received. Contact tracing would then be initiated if a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was received. If a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was received after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>, the individual and their household were advised they no longer needed to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Between 27 January 2021 and 29 March 2021, a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test consequently initiated contact tracing without requirement for a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the individual and their household were advised to self-isolate from the point of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result being received.</p>

<p>From 30 March 2021, the requirement to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. A positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result will continue to trigger contact tracing; however, NHS Test and Trace has introduced improvements to automatically inform anyone self-isolating from a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> to stop isolating if the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is taken promptly and is negative. These individuals will then be removed from contact tracing.</p>

<p>For more information on the types of test see the <a href="#types-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">Types of COVID-19 testing</a> section below.</p>

<h4>People tested and people testing positive</h4>
<p>For both pillars 1 and 2, data for England is provided by the NHS and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and the number of confirmed cases is collated to give the total number of confirmed cases over the reporting period. The headline figures reported in this publication for people tested and people testing positive include both <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests, deduplicated for each reporting week.</p>

<p>More details about the data sources and methodology for pillar 1 and pillar 2 can be found in the section <a href="#section-3" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 testing in the UK</a>. Individuals with negative results from pooled tests are included in these figures. Individuals with positive results from pooled tests are excluded, however, the results from re-tests for those individuals are included.</p>

<p>From 9 April 2021, individuals who receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result and subsequently a negative confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (within 72 hours) are removed from these figures. From 21 May 2021, individuals that receive a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result and subsequently negative confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests within 3 days that are all negative are removed from the underlying data used to produce these figures on a daily basis. More information on this methodology is given on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#change-in-cases-on-9-april-2021">about the data page</a> of the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/?_ga=2.26008765.187805021.1636366073-1831523462.1620657957">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<h4>From 15 October 2020, the methodology for people tested and people testing positive has changed</h4>

<p>Previously, the number of people newly tested and newly testing positive was reported, where the figures were deduplicated over the entirety of the pandemic so an individual would only appear once. This meant someone tested in March and again in September would only be counted in the March counts. This was progressively becoming less meaningful the longer the duration of the pandemic and meant that it was not appropriate to calculate a positivity rate from this data.</p>

<p>Figures are now reported as people tested and people testing positive at least once in the reporting week. People tested or testing positive are only counted once over the 7-day reporting period (Thursday to Wednesday), with a positive test being prioritised over a negative test. A person can be counted within more than one 7-day reporting period. If someone was tested more than once in different reporting weeks, they would be included in the count for all reporting weeks they were tested in.</p>

<p>For example, if a person was tested on Thursday and Friday of the same week, they would only be counted once in the reporting week. However, if someone was tested on Tuesday and Friday of the same week, that individual would be counted in 2 reporting periods, as the 2 tests fall into different 7-day reporting periods. If a person is tested under both pillar 1 and pillar 2 in the same reporting week, then only the pillar they were first tested under is counted, unless they were tested in both pillars on the same day, in which case, they are counted under pillar 2.</p>

<p>If someone had both a positive and a negative result in the same week, only the positive case would be counted, with the result being counted in pillar associated with the positive result. All previous reporting weeks have been backdated and revised with the new methodology.</p>

<p>When deduplicating within the reporting period, people have been matched using a fuzzy matching process. This involves using a combination of name, NHS number and date of birth to find duplicates and then remove them. Due to the nature of the matching, this will not always be a perfect match and there may sometimes be more people removed than necessary, for example, if someone has the same name and date of birth. However, this should only affect a small number of tests.</p>

<p>Demographic and regional data for people tested and people testing positive at least once in the reporting week is available in the weekly collection page. This data has been updated to account for the change in methodology for people tested and people testing positive. Demographic information is published for age, gender, <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> and <abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr>. For pillar 1, data is collected by the hospital, and is then enriched using patient records. For pillar 2, this data is collected when people register for a test and is voluntary, which means that people have the option not to provide their information. Note that for age, a person may fall into more than one age group if their age has changed between reporting weeks in which they were tested.</p>

<p>From 7 January 2021 this data will only be available for those tested using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests. (Data also includes a small number of people tested using <abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr> tests.) This is to ensure the positivity rate remains comparable over time (see the <a href="#weekly-positivity-rate" class="govuk-link">Weekly positivity rate</a> section for more information). Age and gender breakdowns for positive cases that include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>From 19 November 2020, regional information is derived using the person’s address recorded in the laboratory information systems at the time of testing. Before this, a person’s NHS Summary Care record was used. This change was applied to historical data since 1 September 2020 and has been revised. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-comparison-of-geographic-allocation-of-cases-in-england-by-lower-tier-local-authority">COVID-19: comparison of geographic allocation of cases in England by lower-tier local authority</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The totals provided for people tested and people testing positive in the demographic tables will not align with the total number of people tested and people testing positive given in the main publication. This is due to the exclusion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests in the demographic tables in addition to differences in when the data is taken, which means that one source may be more up to date than the other.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of people newly testing positive (deduplicated over the entirety of the pandemic) is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>. The cumulative number of people tested is given in the publication commentary. This gives the total number of people tested and testing positive at least once since the beginning of the pandemic, as well as the proportion of the population that has been tested at least once.</p>

<p>Data provided in the release only gives the cumulative number of people who have ever been tested since Test and Trace launched, so anyone who was tested before 28 May 2020 will not be included.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2021, the Northamptonshire upper tier local authority has been abolished and replaced with two new unitary authorities: North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire. The lower tier local authorities Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough were incorporated into North Northamptonshire, and Daventry, Northampton borough and South Northamptonshire into West Northamptonshire. This change has been incorporated into the publication from the 15 April release onwards. Historic data for these abolished authorities is still available in previous releases.</p>

<p>For more information on local authority boundaries, see the <a href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-tier-local-authority-to-upper-tier-local-authority-april-2021-lookup-in-england-and-wales" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal</a>.</p>

<h4>Weekly positivity rate</h4>

<p>It is no longer recommended that the headline figures for people tested and people testing positive are used to calculate a positivity rate. This is because it’s likely that <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have a different positivity rate to <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests due to the use of LFDs in rapid testing. As the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted is increasing over time, a consistent positivity rate cannot be calculated. From 7 January 2021, the weekly positivity rate has no longer been calculated as part of this publication but can instead be found on the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/testing?areaType=nation&amp;areaName=England">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a> for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> only positive cases in England. As this is for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests only, the positivity rate is comparable over time.</p>

<p>In addition, from 7 January 2021, the breakdown for the number of people tested and number of people testing positive in each reporting week, by age, gender and local authority (found on the weekly collection page) will only include those who have tested positive from a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. This ensures the positivity rates calculated are consistent over time. Age and gender breakdowns for positive cases that include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Note that these <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>-only positivity rates should not be used as a measure of prevalence for the general public as people tested using a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is still not a random sample and is instead focused on people who may be more likely to have COVID-19. Additionally, it will not be an accurate measure of prevalence for the general public as some people will be asymptomatic and not all people who experience COVID-19 symptoms will get tested.</p>

<p>More information about the estimated number of people who have COVID-19 at a given time can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2021-to-2022-season"><abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> surveillance reports</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/latest#covid-19-infection-survey-data" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Coronavirus Infection Survey pilot</a>.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is included in the weekly NHS Test and Trace publication for both pillar 1 and pillar 2 testing in England. This is important for the implementation and performance of NHS Test and Trace as it ensures that people who have tested positive can notify their contacts as quickly as possible to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>For both pillar 1 and pillar 2 turnaround times, the total number of test results reported (and the time taken to do so) is not the same as the number of people tested.</p>

<p>For clinical reasons, some people are tested more than once. Therefore, the number of tests will be higher than the number of people tested. There are several valid reasons why some individuals may be tested more than once, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular testing of health and care workers</li>
  <li>individuals who have the virus, test positive, and have a subsequent test to see if they can return to work</li>
  <li>participation in early trials comparing healthcare professionals administered tests with self-administered tests, resulting in 2 results on the same day</li>
  <li>participation in research studies conducting routine tests on the same people each month</li>
  <li>some tests may come back as ‘void’ and a retest would be issued</li>
  <li>individuals with early symptoms who test negative, develop more symptoms and are retested and found to be positive</li>
  <li>regular testing required by the workplace</li>
</ul>

<p>The data for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result has not been deduplicated. This means that the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given for all tests that have been taken, including those tests that have been carried out on the same person more than once.</p>

<h4>Pillar 1 testing turnaround times</h4>

<p>Pillar 1 testing includes swab testing in <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers. These tests are conducted in hospitals and outbreak locations. The data is recorded by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and NHS labs and covers England only, in line with the tracing data. The location is based on the laboratory site where the test was processed, which is usually an NHS hospital.</p>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result through pillar 1 is only available from 9 July 2020 due to differences in the reporting methodologies for NHS and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> labs. Before this, data regarding the time taken to receive a COVID-19 result is not comparable across <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> and NHS labs. For consistency with other government publications, only comparable data has been included in order to give an overall picture for pillar 1.</p>

<p>There remains a small number of study samples and tests from private laboratories which are excluded from turnaround time figures as no timing data is available. Generally, these tests make up less than 5% of the tests conducted and so their absence should not greatly affect the overall totals.</p>

<p>As some pillar 1 tests are provided to hospital patients, it is not practical for those administering the tests to record the exact time at which the test was taken. Therefore, the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is measured from the time that a test is received by a laboratory for processing to the time when the results are published to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given as the number of tests results available within and after 24hrs of the test being received. This definition differs from those used for pillar 2 so the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result cannot be compared across pillar 1 and pillar 2.</p>

<p>The number of tests included in the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is consistent with testing data published on the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>. The pillar 1 tests by nation on COVID-19 in the UK gives the pillar 1 tests for England daily and the sum of these over the given period will be consistent with the statistics provided here. However, the number of tests will not match exactly due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the small number of study samples and tests from private laboratories that have been excluded from the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result, but which are included in the pillar 1 tests by nation</li>
  <li>differences in when the data is taken, which means that one source may be more up to date than the other</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pillar 2 testing turnaround times</h4>

<p>There are various routes for getting tested within pillar 2 (national swab testing). Data on the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result for pillar 2 is presented for all routes combined and split up to reflect the different routes, as this impacts on the turnaround times. Note that this data does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. The routes for taking a test through pillar 2 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regional test sites, which includes drive-through testing centres</li>
  <li>local test sites, which are similar to regional test sites but specifically for walk ups</li>
  <li>mobile testing units, which travel around the UK to increase access to COVID-19 testing – they respond to need, travelling to test people at specific sites including care homes, police stations and prisons</li>
  <li>satellite test centres, which includes test kits provided directly to ‘satellite’ centres at places like care homes or hospitals that have a particularly urgent or significant need – the majority of tests from satellite test centres are care home tests</li>
  <li>home test kits, which are delivered to someone’s door so they can test themselves and their family without leaving the house</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, local test sites were included together with regional test sites but from 17 September 2020 they have been split out as a separate group.</p>

<p>From 4 March 2021, new satellite sub-channels have been included within the satellite test turnaround time data. These new sub-channels make up approximately 5% of the total number of satellite tests and includes satellite tests used by schools, hospices and within domiciliary care. From 18 March 2021, further sub-channels have been included to the satellite channel, making up 0.1% of the total number of satellite tests. This includes tests used in adult day-care centres and arrivals from red countries. Data previously published for satellite testing turnaround times have been revised to include these new routes.</p>

<p>From 18 March 2021, new sub-channels have been included within the home test turnaround time data. These new sub-channels make up approximately 8% of the total number of home tests and includes tests used in schools, for arrivals from amber countries and in vaccine trials. Data previously published for home testing turnaround times have been revised to include these new routes. From 11 November 2021, additional subchannels for vaccinated international arrivals, the events research program and dental patient testing were added to the home test turnaround data making up approximately 10% of the weekly number of home test kits.</p>

<p>The data for pillar 2 has been taken for England only, in line with the tracing data. There are differences in the way that the location of a test is allocated depending upon the route for taking the test:</p>

<p>1. For regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, the location of the testing site is used to assign the location of the person being tested. This means that any tests carried out at test sites in England will be included, even though this may include tests of people who were tested in England but live outside of England and may exclude tests of people who live in England but have been tested outside of England.</p>

<p>2. For home testing and satellite test centres, people’s home addresses are used to assign the location of the person being tested. Note: this methodology has changed from using the location of the lab that processes the test, which was used until the start of August 2020. Previous figures have been revised to take into account the new methodology.</p>

<p>Testing turnaround times data does not include Randox tests, as these are handled through a different system. This will not affect the data for regional test sites, local test sites, mobile testing units or home test kits, but Randox tests made up a significant proportion of the tests conducted in care homes, which form part of the satellite test centres. Until 16 July 2020, Randox tests made up just under 40% of the tests used in care homes. However, their use is being phased out and from 17 July 2020 these tests make up less than 5% of the tests conducted in care homes.</p>

<p>The number of tests included in the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result will not be the same as the total number of people tested for COVID-19. In addition to the general reasons stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#time-taken">Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result</a> section, there are a number of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is different – the number of people tested and testing positive for COVID-19 is taken from <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, whilst the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is taken from commercial partners</li>
  <li>the data for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result has not been deduplicated – this means that the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given for all tests that have been taken, including those tests that have been carried out on the same person more than once</li>
  <li>the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result uses different metrics to segregate data for England from the UK</li>
  <li>the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is reported by the date the test was registered whereas people tested are reported against the specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>Turnaround times are measured and reported in 2 ways: time taken from booking a test and from taking a test to receiving a test result. Details are given below. From 27 August 2020, median turnaround times are reported for both measures, in addition to the usual turnaround time windows, such as within 24 hours. For all measures the test is recorded against the date the test was registered.</p>

<p>For all measures of time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result, there are a number of test results that were not received. This covers any test where the results were not communicated, which may be because communication details (for example, phone number or email address) were not provided or were incorrect, or because the test was cancelled or abandoned, or no result was available. It also includes some tests that are still being processed. Some of these people may still have been passed into the contact-tracing system, but the data from the pillar 2 test does not show that their tests were complete. From 17 September 2020 the number of results not received was split to show those which were unsuccessful and those still in progress. Previously these were reported together.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of test</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of test is measured from the time a person completes a test registration (or the time a person indicates their test was taken for home testing kits) until the time that they receive a notification of the result of their test via an email or an SMS. The time that a person completes their test registration should reflect the approximate time that the person took their test, but the accuracy of this will vary depending upon the route that they used to take the test.</p>

<p>For home testing kits, the start time is measured from the time a person inputs that they took their test (note that this process changed from the time a test was registered using a barcode scan, from July 2020 onwards). When a person registers their test, they are asked to give the time that their test was taken. This measure is self-reported but allows current and previous data to be measured using the same definition and allows for a more accurate end-to-end time to be calculated.</p>

<p>For regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, registration is completed before the test in a controlled environment and so for most tests this provides a precise measure of when the test was taken.</p>

<p>For satellite test centres, the time of test registration may not exactly align with the time that the test is taken. For example, a care home might complete registrations the night before they administer the tests. However, the start time used is consistent enough to provide comparable data on the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from the time of test for all mechanisms of testing. Satellite tests are predominantly used by care homes who need greater control and flexibility over when test kits are collected. For example, tests may be conducted over multiple days with a collection scheduled a few days later. Because of this, a lower proportion of test results will be available within 24 hours of the test being taken.</p>

<p>After someone takes a test, their test is transported to a laboratory for processing. There are normal fluctuations in this operational process which can sometimes cause the time taken to receive a test result to go over 24 hours, but still be turned around the next day. Where appropriate, the number of tests turned around the day after a test was taken are provided.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of booking</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of booking is measured from the time that a person books an appointment on the website to the time when the person receives a notification of their test result via an email or an SMS. This data is only available for regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, as test booking and registration processes for home testing and satellite test centres are currently undertaken on different systems.</p>

<h4>Pillar 2 distance to take an in-person test</h4>

<p>From 24 September 2020, the distance to take an in-person test has been included for pillar 2 tests. For each person who successfully registered for a test (including those who registered for a test but did not turn up to the test site) under pillar 2 at a regional test site, local test site or mobile testing unit, the distance between their location and their associated testing site is measured as the direct distance (that is, in a straight line ‘as the crow flies’).</p>

<p>A person’s home location is calculated as the approximate centre of their postal district (for example, PO15) provided at the time of booking. The centre of the postal district is used instead of the full postcode for data protection reasons and is measured using publicly available <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> census data. These distances reported are the median and 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles for those who successfully booked a test at regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units. Note that data on distance to take a test does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<h3>Contact tracing in England</h3>

<p>Once a person has a confirmed positive test result for COVID-19, this person is transferred to NHS Test and Trace and a case is opened for them. NHS Test and Trace makes an initial decision on how to manage the case based on the exposure settings of the individual, in other words, the place in which the person may have exposed others to the virus. There are a few points when this can happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a case is first reported there is a check against care home postcodes</li>
  <li>the data provided by people responding online via the secure website is queried to look for certain exposure settings</li>
  <li>if call handlers identify a certain exposure setting while speaking to the individual</li>
</ul>

<p>Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace are managed in different ways depending on their exposure settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as complex cases): <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> manage cases linked to outbreaks – before 18 March 2021, this included the following settings (including someone who works in or has recently visited):
    <ul>
      <li>a health or care setting, such as a hospital or care home</li>
      <li>a prison or other secure setting</li>
      <li>a school for people with special needs</li>
      <li>critical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After 18 March 2021, only cases in health or care settings were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cases not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as non-complex cases): wider online and other call centre capacity for cases that are not linked to the above exposure settings, plus the use of local teams in certain regions</li>
</ul>

<p>For cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, contacts are often managed at a situation rather than individual level, with advice being issued to the contact institution.</p>

<p>For those cases not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, the NHS Test and Trace service will get in contact via a text, email alert or phone call. People are asked to share details of other people with whom they have had close, recent contact and places they have visited. They can respond online via a secure website or by telephone with a contact tracer.</p>

<p>On occasion, the NHS Test and Trace service may handle a person’s case and later escalate to a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>From 29 October 2020, the terminology relating to cases has changed to reflect the contact tracing operations more accurately. The cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not necessarily more complex than individual cases and contacts managed by national contact tracers and therefore the terms ‘complex’ and ‘non-complex’ have been removed. Cases and contacts are handled in different ways depending on their exposure setting, with positive cases linked to potential outbreaks in specific settings being handled by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. These cases and contacts are therefore referred to as ‘cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’ from 29 October 2020. Cases and contacts managed nationally either online or by call centres are referred to as ‘cases and contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’. This change is to the terminology used to describe the 2 methods of handling cases and contacts and does not impact on the methodology used to break down the data.</p>

<p>From 14 December 2020, operational changes have been introduced to improve how the outcomes of contact tracing calls are recorded. These changes ensure more consistency in how handlers record the call outcome and associated improvements in workflows. These changes are reflected in the data published from 24 December 2020.</p>

<h4>Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<p>The number of positive cases transferred to the contact-tracing system may not always align with the number of people testing positive for COVID-19. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delays between a sample being taken, tested and reported, and being passed from <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> to the contact-tracing system mean that weekly totals transferred to NHS Test and Trace may include people who were tested in the previous week</li>
  <li>there is not a rigorous process for deduplicating the data being passed into the contact-tracing system each day, as the emphasis is on transferring these cases quickly – some people may have their case transferred to the contact-tracing system more than once, which means there may be more people transferred to contact tracing than test positive for COVID-19 within a given period</li>
</ul>

<p>When a case is transferred to NHS Test and Trace contact tracers will attempt to contact the individual which results in one the following 3 outcomes:</p>

<h4>1. Reached and provided information about recent close contacts</h4>
<p>Contact tracers or local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> successfully reached the individual and asked them to provide details for recent close contacts.</p>

<h4>2. No communication details provided</h4>
<p>People who had no communication details provided are those who were transferred to NHS Test and Trace but did not have any associated contact details (for example phone number or email address).</p>

<h4>3. Not reached</h4>
<p>The number of people who were not reached includes those people who the service has been unable to reach because there has been no response to text, email and call reminders. It also includes people who were reached but declined to give details of close contacts. There may also be a small number of people who have not been reached but where contact tracers are still in the process of trying to make contact.</p>

<p><br>
Those people who have been reached and provided information about recent close contacts has been split to show the people whose cases were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and people whose cases were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. If NHS Test and Trace is not able to reach a person or if no communication details are available, it is not always possible to know if the case would have been managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> or not. Therefore, these breakdowns are not available.</p>

<h4>Number of people who were reached by upper-tier local authority</h4>

<p>The number of positive cases transferred to the contact-tracing system and the number who were reached and provided information about recent close contacts is also provided for each upper-tier local authority (<abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>) area. Cases are matched to a <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> via their postcode so, in general, this information refers to people who are living in that <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>. Data for City of London and Hackney, and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have been combined due to their smaller population size. Numbers below 3 are suppressed to ensure that no one is identifiable from the data</p>

<p>While it is possible to subtract the cumulative data by <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> for consecutive weeks to give the weekly numbers, this does not account for the revisions that are made to the data each week. As such, this will sometimes result in more people seeming to be reached than were transferred. For this reason, it is not advisable to use the data in this way.</p>

<h4>Number of people providing details of one or more recent close contacts</h4>

<p>Not everyone who was reached and asked to provide details of recent close contacts will have had any recent close contacts. The number who were not able to give any recent close contacts therefore refers to people who were successfully reached by NHS Test and Trace, but either had no recent close contacts or could not provide details of close recent contacts to pass on for further contact tracing (for example, recent close contact with strangers on the bus).</p>

<h4>Number of people who were reached by the method used to reach them</h4>

<p>When a case that is not managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> is first transferred to contact tracing, they are sent a link to the NHS Test and Trace website where they are invited to record the details of their close contacts online. This is the default method of communication for cases that are not managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before 13 October 2020, cases in areas with locally supported contact tracing did not have the option to self-completion online. However, this was reinstated from this point. Cases are given 8 hours to complete online and if they fail to do so they are then contacted by phone by a contact tracer. This breakdown is only available for cases that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are usually managed at a situation rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The total number of cases reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not always match the sum of those reached by phone and web due to a small number of cases for whom the method by which they were reached is not recorded or ambiguous.</p>

<p>From 29 January 2021, there has been a minor change in the method used to reach cases from areas where there are known <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>. These cases are transferred to both the self-completion online route and the phone route at the same time (rather than allowing them 8 hours to complete online before contacting them by phone). All these cases have been recorded as completed by phone as it is not currently possible in the data to distinguish which route was used.</p>

<p>This previously affected only a small number of cases, however from 1 March 2021, this method has been rolled out for cases from all areas and some contacts. Consequently, from 11 March 2021, this breakdown has been removed from the NHS Test and Trace weekly publication while we explore the feasibility of using a different method to distinguish the route used.</p>

<h4>Time taken for people transferred to contact tracing to identify recent close contacts</h4>

<p>This is the time taken from a case being set up and a person being transferred to contact tracing to the time the person was reached and asked to provide information about recent close contacts. This data is only collected for people who were reached. It excludes cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as part of outbreak investigations.</p>

<h4>Close contacts identified by NHS Test and Trace, England</h4>

<p>Once a person has tested positive, they are contacted and asked to identify recent close contacts. When asked for recent close contacts, close contact means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having face-to-face contact with someone (less than 1 metre away)</li>
  <li>spending more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of someone</li>
  <li>travelling in a car or other small vehicle with someone (even on a short journey) or close to them on a plane</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Recent’ refers to anybody that the person has been in close contact with in the 48 hours before they developed symptoms and the time since they developed symptoms.</p>

<p>Orphan contacts are contacts identified via the NHS COVID-19 app, where there is therefore no associated case. These orphan contacts make up only a very small number of contacts (they are less than 1% of identified contacts). These contacts were removed from the weekly statistics from 27 April 2021 until 1 July 2021 when they were included again in the underlying data.</p>

<p>Data prior to 1 July 2021 has not been revised to include orphan contacts – they are therefore only present in the data from 1 July 2021 onwards.</p>

<p>For cases that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, the way in which recent close contacts are identified has changed since the beginning of NHS Test and Trace. For example, when Test and Trace began, everyone who lived or worked within a setting such as a care home with a person who tested positive for COVID-19 would have been considered a contact. Since then, the guidance has changed and <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> now consider factors such as direct contact and the use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, instead of recording all people in each setting.</p>

<p>Contacts managed as part of outbreaks by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> have been deduplicated where possible to only count a person once <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once contacts have been identified, they will be contacted in turn by the NHS Test and Trace service and advised to self-isolate for a period of 10 days.</p>

<p>As with positive cases, contacts are handled in different ways depending on the exposure setting – in other words, where the contact was likely to have been exposed to the virus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as complex cases): <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> manage contacts linked to outbreaks – before 18 March 2021, this included the following settings (including someone who works in or has recently visited):
    <ul>
      <li>a health or care setting, such as a hospital or care home</li>
      <li>a prison or other secure setting</li>
      <li>a school for people with special needs</li>
      <li>critical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After 18 March 2021, only contacts in health or care settings were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as non-complex): wider online and other call centre capacity for contacts that are not linked to the above exposure settings</li>
</ul>

<p>From 29 October 2020, the terminology relating to contacts has changed in order to more accurately reflect the contact tracing operations. The cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not necessarily more complex than individual cases and contacts managed by national contact tracers and therefore the terms ‘complex’ and ‘non-complex’ have been removed. Cases and contacts are handled in different ways depending on their exposure setting, with positive cases linked to potential outbreaks in specific settings being handled by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. These cases and contacts are therefore referred to as ‘cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’ from 29 October 2020. Cases and contacts managed nationally either online or by call centres are referred to as ‘cases and contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’. This change is to the terminology used to describe the 2 methods of handling cases and contacts and does not impact the methodology used to break down the data in this way.</p>

<p>A small number of contacts are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> initially and are later escalated to a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Generally, contacts who are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not be recorded individually, as the local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> manage these contacts at a situation rather than individual level. However, since the launch of the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme, it is sometimes necessary for contacts that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> to be recorded independently of the exposure setting. This may result in some duplication of contacts, although this is only thought to affect a small number of individuals.</p>

<h4>Number of recent close contacts identified</h4>

<p>When a contact is identified, contact tracers will attempt to contact the individual which results in one the following 3 outcomes:</p>

<p>1. Reached and advised to self-isolate: for contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, contact tracers successfully reached the individual and advised them to self-isolate – for those managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, advice is provided to the institution which is passed on to the individuals in the specific setting.</p>

<p>2. Communication details not provided: people who were identified as recent close contacts but did not have any associated contact details (for example phone number or email address).</p>

<p>3. Not reached: the number of people who were not reached includes those people who the service has been unable to reach because there has been no response to text, email and call reminders – there may also be a small number of people who have not been reached but where contact tracers are still in the process of trying to make contact.</p>

<p>The outcome will partly depend on whether the person is managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> or not and the data has been split to give the outcomes for these contacts separately. For contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, it is not possible to be identified as a close contact and not have communication details provided because these are managed at a situation, rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The number of contacts identified is not deduplicated because a single person may be reported as a contact on multiple occasions if they have come into close contact with more than one positive case. They would therefore be contact traced multiple times to ensure the correct period of self-isolation is given. For this reason, the number of contacts identified, and the number of contacts reached does not represent the number of unique individuals.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, there is a change in how household contacts under 18 are reached. These changes mean that under-18s in a household will not each have to be contact-traced individually, as long as the parent or guardian in the household confirms they have completed their legal duty to inform their child to self-isolate. If no parental permission is provided, NHS Test and Trace will follow the standard contact-tracing routes. These changes have been implemented acting on feedback the service has received from families and should see a reduction in the number of calls received by households with children. From 27 November 2020, changes have been extended to cover adults in the same household. They will have the option to be traced through a single phone call, further reducing the number of calls made to the same household. This change will also optimise the productivity of the tracing service by minimising the number of calls made.</p>

<p>If a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is asked to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. If a case provides information for household contacts over 18, they are given the option to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate so these contacts are not contacted individually by contact tracers. (If the case does not want to take responsibility for over 18s in their household, they will be contacted by contact tracers as usual.) The case provides some basic information for the household contacts and each record is reported as complete. This change is expected to increase the proportion of household contacts reached and consequently the total number of contacts reached. It is also expected to increase the proportion of contacts reached within 24 hours.</p>

<p>From 27 August 2020, information about the median number of contacts per case has been included. Because of the nature of outbreaks, there can be a higher number of contacts associated to cases that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> in comparison to contacts identified through the contact-tracing system. These contacts are often managed at a situation level rather than individually, with advice being issued to the contact institution. When local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> record whether contact tracing has been completed, they therefore do this for the whole situation (meaning all associated contacts will be counted as having been reached and told to self-isolate).</p>

<p>This data does not include information about compliance and there may be some people who were identified as recent close contacts and told to self-isolate but have not agreed to do so.</p>

<h4>Number of contacts who were reached by upper-tier local authority</h4>

<p>The number of close contacts identified that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and the number who were reached and told to self-isolate is also provided for each upper-tier local authority (<abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>) area. Contacts are matched to a <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> via their postcode so, in general, this information refers to people who are living in that <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>. On some occasions, postcode data is not available for contacts, in which case the postcode of the case from which the contact originated is used. Data for City of London, Hackney, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have been combined due to their smaller population sizes. Numbers below 3 are suppressed to ensure that no one is identifiable from the data.</p>

<p>While it is possible to subtract the cumulative data by <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> for consecutive weeks to give the weekly numbers, this does not account for the revisions that are made to the data each week. As such, this will sometimes result in more people seeming to be reached than were transferred. For this reason, it is not advisable to use the data in this way.</p>

<p>As of 1 April 2021, Northamptonshire County, Corby, Daventry, East Northamptonshire, Kettering, Northampton, South Northamptonshire and Wellingborough have been consolidated into North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>For more information on local authority boundaries, see the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-tier-local-authority-to-upper-tier-local-authority-april-2021-lookup-in-england-and-wales">Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal</a>.</p>

<h4>Number of household and non-household contacts</h4>

<p>The number of household contacts has been included for cases and contacts that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. This shows the number of recent close contacts who live in the same household as the person who has tested positive for COVID-19 and the number who were reached and told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, there is a change in how household contacts under 18 are reached. If a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. The case provides some basic information for the household contacts and each record is reported as complete.</p>

<p>From 27 November 2020, changes have been extended to cover household contacts over 18 so they have the option to be traced through a single phone call, further reducing the number of calls made to the same household.</p>

<p>Before these changes, it is likely that cases would advise their household contacts to self-isolate in advance of these contacts being directly contacted by contact tracers. Therefore, even where household contacts are recorded as not reached and advised to self-isolate, they may have already been aware of their exposure and isolating appropriately. This may have been a contributing factor to a lower proportion of household contacts being reached in comparison to non-household contacts.</p>

<h4>Number of contacts who were reached by the method used to reach them</h4>

<p>This is a breakdown of contacts who were reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> by whether they were reached by phone, online or via their household case. From 18 November 2020, if a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contact traced individually, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. From 27 November 2020, this change was also extended to cover adults in the same household, so they have the option to be traced via a single phone call. The method by which contacts were reached is therefore broken down into household and non-household contacts as only household contacts have the option to complete via their case.</p>

<p>When a contact is first identified, providing they are not a household contact or managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, they are sent a link to the NHS Test and Trace website where they are provided with self-isolation advice and are asked to confirm that they will follow this advice. Contacts are given 8 hours to complete online and if they fail to do so they are then contacted via phone by a contact tracer. This breakdown is only available for contacts that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as contacts that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are usually managed at a situation rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The total number of contacts reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not always match the sum of those reached by phone, online and via their household case due to a small number of contacts for whom the method by which they were reached is not recorded or ambiguous.</p>

<p>From 29 January 2021, there has been a minor change in the method used to reach cases from areas where there are known variants of concern (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr>). These cases are transferred to both the self-completion online route and the phone route at the same time (rather than allowing them 8 hours to complete online before contacting them by phone). All these cases have been recorded as completed by phone as it is not currently possible in the data to distinguish which route was used.</p>

<p>This previously affected only a small number of cases, however, from 1 March 2021, this method has been rolled out for cases from all areas and some contacts. Consequently, from 11 March 2021, this breakdown has been removed from the NHS Test and Trace weekly publication while we explore the feasibility of using a different method to distinguish the route used.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached</h4>

<p>This is the time taken from a recent close contact being identified by a person to the contact being reached and advised to self-isolate. It only includes those recent close contacts who were reached and told to self-isolate and excludes contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, if a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. These contacts are included in the timing information for contact tracing as being reached within 24 hours from being identified. From 27 November 2020, this change was also extended to cover adults in the same household, so they have the option to be traced via a single phone call.</p>

<p>From 11 February 2021, additional times are also provided to give a sense of the end-to-end journey time through the test and trace system. These are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>time taken for close contacts to be reached from the time when the positive case that reported them was transferred to the contact tracing system</li>
  <li>time taken for close contacts to be reached from the time when the positive case that reported them took the test that subsequently returned a positive result</li>
  <li>median time taken for close contacts to be reached from the time that a symptomatic person who tested positive, and was subsequently contacted by NHS Test and Trace, first observed these symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that these times are not necessarily directly comparable to each other as certain cases or contacts may be included in some breakdowns and not others. More information on each of these time series is provided below.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached from the time the positive case that identified them was transferred to contact tracing system</h4>

<p>This information is only available for contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, although there are a small number of these contacts where they are associated with a case that was managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and for whom this data is not available. This means that the total number of contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will be lower than that reported elsewhere in the publication. However, this affects less than 1% of the contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and were reached.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached from when the case that identified them took the test</h4>

<p>This measure is only currently available as the number of days since the test was taken. This is because only information on the day of the test is collected in the contact tracing system.</p>

<p>As with the other time series for close contacts to be reached, contacts that were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not included.</p>

<h4>Median time taken from when the case first observed symptoms to when their close contacts were reached</h4>

<p>When a person who has tested positive is reached by NHS Test and Trace, they are asked if they have been experiencing any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>high temperature or fever (higher than 38 degrees Celsius)</li>
  <li>loss or change to sense of smell or taste</li>
  <li>altered consciousness</li>
  <li>diarrhoea</li>
  <li>extreme tiredness</li>
  <li>headaches</li>
  <li>joint pain</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
  <li>muscle ache</li>
  <li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
  <li>nosebleed</li>
  <li>rash</li>
  <li>runny nose</li>
  <li>seizures</li>
  <li>sneezing</li>
  <li>sore throat</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
  <li>other</li>
  <li>none</li>
</ul>

<p>If a person reports one or more of these symptoms, they are then asked what date they first had these symptoms. This self-reported date is used to calculate the time from the case first observing symptoms to the close contact being reached.</p>

<p>As this data is collected by asking people testing positive to recall a date, it is not possible to obtain accurate information on the exact time symptoms were first observed. All time measures more exact than full days are derived by taking 12 noon as the time of symptom onset. This assumes that the time of symptom onset is distributed evenly throughout the day.</p>

<p>Due to this data being self-declared by people testing positive, potential sources of error are that people may incorrectly recall when they first had symptoms. People who are reached online may also enter an incorrect date when requested to do so, such as their date of birth, a date before March 2020 or a date far in the future. The data is also cleaned to remove cases where the date of symptom onset is after the contact was reached.</p>

<p>The average number of days and hours is presented as the median rather than the mean. The median is regarded as a more representative average value when the data contains a small number of very high values. In this case, a small number of people who were recorded in the data as having been contacted by NHS Test and Trace a long time after symptom onset may have had a disproportionate effect on the average time experienced by most people. For this reason, the median is presented as a representative average.</p>

<h2>Managed quarantine service</h2>

<h3>Background and operational context</h3>

<p>Tables 19, 20a, 20b, and 21 present data on arrivals into England from abroad. Table 19 shows data on people in quarantine in hotels and at home having arrived from abroad; Tables 20a and 20b present data on tests taken by arrivals; and Table 21 presents data on people tested by country or territory of departure.</p>

<p>Table 20a shows data on <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests by international arrivals between 15 February and 29 September 2021, while Table 20b shows <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests from 30 September 2021 until the present. The change in policy permitting use of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests by international arrivals has necessitated reporting Table 20 in 2 parts. Between 15 February and 8 April 2021, all arrivals in England were required to undertake 2 mandatory polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) COVID-19 tests – on day 2 and day 8 of their 10-day quarantine.</p>

<p>A traffic light system for travel to England came into effect on 9 April 2021, which categorised countries based on risk alongside the restrictions required for travel. The traffic light system categorised countries into green, amber or red. Green arrivals were not required to quarantine but they had to take a day 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on arrival into England.</p>

<p>Arrivals from amber list countries were required to quarantine for a period of 10 days and take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on day 2 and day 8 with the option for test to release on day 5 to end self-isolation early.</p>

<p>Arrivals from red list countries were required to self-isolate in a managed quarantine hotel for 10 days upon arrival and take <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> day 2 and day 8 tests.</p>

<p>Further changes were introduced on 4 October 2021, with countries and territories now categorised as red or rest of the world. Fully-vaccinated arrivals from countries and territories not on the red list are required to only take a day 2 test, while requirements for arrivals from countries and territories on the red list remain the same as before 4&nbsp;October 2021 – whether such arrivals are fully vaccinated or not.</p>

<p>A country or territory may be designated red or rest of the world following a ministerial decision-making process. Designations of countries and territories are published by the Department for Transport and are reviewed on a regular basis. Therefore, they are subject to change and the data released will reflect the lists as they were on the date of release. For more details see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae">guidance on entering the UK</a>.</p>

<p>The statistical bulletin contains data relating to countries and territories on the red list and those categorised as rest of the world. Table 21 in the accompanying data tables contains data for all countries and territories where a traveller has been registered in the corresponding period. A full explanation of the data sources and methods used to produce these statistics can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-methodology">NHS Test and Trace statistics methodology</a>.</p>

<h4>Number of people starting their quarantine period</h4>

<p>Individuals arriving in England from red list and non-red list countries are required to book a travel test package and complete a passenger locator form which identifies whether they are quarantining at home or in a managed quarantine hotel. The number of travel test packages booked is used to calculate the number of people starting their quarantine period. The date of arrival or check-in is used as the start date of the quarantine period (day 0). As some travellers are exempt, this is not the same as the total number of people arriving into the country.</p>

<p>International arrivals from a non-red list country or territory have the option to book their quarantine package through a private provider. As of the 8 July 2021 publication release, these figures are now included in the data.</p>

<p>As of 6 September 2021, private bookings of quarantine packages have become available in Scotland. Currently there is no way of separating these bookings out of Table 19 and as such, from the date the number of people starting their quarantine period at home will include those from Scotland who booked their package via a private provider.</p>

<h4>People taking tests</h4>

<p>People quarantining following their arrival in the UK from red list countries or territories or non-red list countries or territories, if they are not fully vaccinated, are required to take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8 of their return to the UK. All positive samples are sent for whole genome sequencing to identify, monitor, and limit the number of variants in the UK population.</p>

<p>The day 2 test is designed to help identify any potentially harmful variants of COVID-19 at the earliest opportunity and provide population-level variant surveillance. If a person gets a positive result from their day 2 test, they do not need to take a test on day 8. If a person has quarantined for 10 days and received a negative result to both their day 2 and day 8 tests, then they may stop quarantining. Fully-vaccinated arrivals can end their quarantine if their day 2 test is negative.</p>

<p>Starting from 11 March 2021, people returning from rest of the world (previously amber and green) have the option to use tests from private providers rather than the Test and Trace programme, where tests meet stringent minimum testing standards. As of the 8&nbsp;July 2021 publication release, this data is included. View the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">list of private providers for COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<p>From 26 March 2021, all NHS Test and Trace home test kits ordered by arrivals who did not have to book with the NHS have the sample identification barcode captured at the point of dispatch. This means that all test samples from such arrivals can be linked to the address where the tests were sent to, further improving tracing. Testing data is provided from this date onwards.</p>

<p>When a person in quarantine receives their test kit, they are required to register the test kit barcode. As part of the NHS Test and Trace registration they are asked to provide a reason for taking the test and have the option to select ‘quarantining at home’ or ‘quarantining in a managed quarantine hotel’. Because of the reliance on an individual selecting this option when registering, the number of registered and processed tests taken by those quarantining at home and in managed quarantine hotels may be undercounted in our figures.</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kits correctly registered with a test reason of ‘isolation-testing facility’ can be identified as relating to an individual quarantining at a managed quarantine hotel (passengers from red list countries and territories).</p>

<p>Test kits with a test reason of ‘isolation-testing-home’ can be used to identify home quarantine tests (passengers from non-red countries who are not fully vaccinated (previously amber countries and territories).</p>

<p>The number of tests refers to the number of tests processed and registered and not the number of individuals tested, as people can have more than one test. Children under 5 years old are not required to take day 2 or day 8 tests so are not included in the results.</p>

<p>An individual could have multiple void tests before their first valid test. Any tests up to and including their first valid test are counted as day 2 tests. Any tests after this are counted as day 8 tests.</p>

<p>The number of tests registered and processed each week will not be the same as the number of people quarantining in that same week for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cohort of people starting their quarantine will not be the same cohort of people who take their day 2 test in each week. For example, people starting their quarantine towards the end of the week will have their day 2 tests fall into the following week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There may be differences in the population quarantining and those who are required to take a test, for example children under 5 do not need to take a test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Passengers with a positive test on day 2 are not required to take a day 8 test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Correct completion and return of test data is required by the person taking the test to ensure that tests are correctly registered.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the publications released between 29 July 2021 and 29 September 2021, positive tests by international arrivals from countries and territories on the red and amber lists are reported in Table 20a while Table 20b reports tests by international arrivals from countries and territories categorised as red and rest of the world.</p>

<h4>Unregistered tests processed</h4>
<p>In Tables 20a and 20b, a test is classified as ‘Unregistered’ or having ‘incomplete records’ if it fits into one of 2 categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Test is not registered to an individual. This test can still be identified using the sample identification barcode captured at the point of dispatch, but it is not possible to decode which day of quarantine the test was taken without being able to identify the individual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test is taken by an arrival whose point of departure cannot be ascertained. These tests are registered to an individual, and as such regular contact tracing for these samples is possible. This accounted for approximately 98% of ‘Unregistered tests processed – quarantining at home’ during the week ending 11 August 2021</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Risk assessment status, people tested, positivity and variants by country or territory</h4>

<p>When passengers return from their country or territory of travel, they are asked to register the travel destination they are returning from. The recent travel destination provided is used to track several metrics by country or territory. This information, along with data from other sources, is used to determine if a country is put on the ‘red list’ or not. Full methodology for these decisions can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-risk-assessment-methodology-to-inform-international-travel-traffic-light-system" class="govuk-link">international travel traffic light system guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Testing of international arrivals is designed to help identify any potentially harmful variants of COVID-19 at the earliest opportunity. Variants are designated as Variant under Investigation (<abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr>) if they are considered to have any concerning epidemiological, immunological or pathogenic properties. Following a risk assessment with the relevant expert committee, they may be designated a Variant of Concern (<abbr title="Variant of Concern">VOC</abbr>). The variants classified as a <abbr title="Variant of Concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr> may change over time and the tables in the accompanying data tables will reflect the <abbr title="Variant of Concern">VOC</abbr> or <abbr title="Variant Under Investigation">VUI</abbr> status at the point of publication.</p>

<p>In this bulletin and the accompanying tables, the country or territory the passenger returned from is self-reported. In cases where a travel destination has not been reported, this is classified as ‘Unknown’ in Table 21. In cases where multiple travel destinations are reported, this is categorised as ’Unknown-multiple‘ in the same table. Traveller positivity is calculated by dividing the number of people testing positive by the total number of people testing positive and negative. Variants (<abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> or VUIs) detection rate is calculated by dividing the number of variants detected by the number of positive tests sequenced.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace home test kits ordered by non-red list (previously amber) international arrivals have had the sample identification barcode captured at the point of dispatch from 26 March 2021 onwards. This means testing is further improved as non-red list (previously amber) arrivals’ test samples can be linked to the address they were sent to. Country level data is provided from this date onward.</p>

<p>The methodology used in the identification of <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> or VUIs, positivity and tests is under further development.</p>

<p>Data for risk assessment status, testing, positivity, and variants by country or territory can be found in the ‘Table 21’ tab of the accompanying data tables. While the other Managed Quarantine Service data tables will be updated weekly, Table 21 will be updated every 3 weeks. This will align the data with the Joint Biosecurity Centre’s assessments of the latest data, which are also conducted every 3 weeks. All weeks will be covered by the data. Three-weekly data will also be less volatile, as it will not be dependent on the smaller numbers of tests measured within each week.</p>

<h4>Private tests</h4>

<p>Since 11 March 2021, people quarantining at home from non-red list countriesor territories (previously amber), have the option to use tests from private providers rather than the Test and Trace programme. As of the 8 July 2021 publication release, this data is included.</p>

<p>From the publication on 24 June 2021 onwards, tests from private providers for those returning from non-red list countries or territories (previously amber) have also been included in the published figures in Table 21. The methodology for calculating positivity rates, identifying <abbr title="variants of concern">VOCs</abbr> and VUIs and country of origin is the same as for public tests. Private tests for an individual arriving from red list countries are not available as the individual must quarantine in an approved hotel.</p>

<h4>Test to Release scheme</h4>

<p>People returning to England from non-red countries or territories who are not fully vaccinated (previously amber) can end their quarantine after 5 days through the Test to Release scheme. This scheme is voluntary and allows people to pay for a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test from an approved private provider. With a negative test result, the quarantine can end. However, a positive result means the quarantine needs to be extended by a further 10 days. The private tests booked through this scheme are in addition to the day 2 and day 8 tests booked as part of the Managed Quarantine Service. This data is available in tables 20a and 20b.</p>

<h2>Tests conducted, England</h2>

<p>This section describes the methodology behind the data published in the ‘Tests conducted’ data tables on the weekly collection page and the statistical bulletin on rapid asymptomatic testing.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>Several organisations supply data from multiple sources into the weekly statistics on testing. The different data streams are collated centrally by <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. NHS Digital provides data for England and some data comes from commercial partners.</p>

<p>The data provided by the organisations mentioned above is provided under Data Sharing Agreements allowing the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> access.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, this data contains tests taken through the pillar 2 testing routes only (swab testing the wider population).</p>

<p>For the total number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, this data includes those reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and doesn’t include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route. The following use cases for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not reporting results digitally into Test and Trace systems, and therefore are excluded from the totals in this report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing for the majority of NHS secondary care staff – these are reported separately in the publication</li>
  <li>testing for some staff in private sector industries</li>
  <li>testing for some hauliers – these are published separately at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/haulier-coronavirus-testing" class="govuk-link">haulier COVID-19 testing</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, test results should be reported directly to <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test produces a result on the device almost immediately, without it being automatically recorded, therefore some results might not be captured. For settings where self-reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing procedures are in place, it is likely that the number of tests conducted are underreported. It is however their statutory duty to do so, and easier reporting tools are being rolled out to support these individuals to report their tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is possible that tests with a negative result are more likely to be affected, therefore it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with the data.</p>

<h3>Timings and revisions</h3>

<p>A snapshot of this data is taken for publication several days after the end of the reporting period to give time for tests reported at the end of the 7-day period to be captured. Figures given in previous releases are routinely revised as some tests may continue to be reported after this period.</p>

<p>Daily totals reflect actual counts reported for the previous day. Each day there may be corrections to previous reported figures. This means that previously published daily and weekly counts will not necessarily sum to the latest cumulative figure. It also means that today’s cumulative count may not match the previous day’s cumulative count plus today’s daily count.</p>

<p>Data is supplied daily from several different electronic data collection systems, and these can experience technical issues which can affect daily figures, usually resulting in lower daily counts.</p>

<p>If the quality of source data improves, there may be further revisions to historic time series. If this does occur, the rationale and impact of these revisions will be clearly highlighted.</p>

<p>Each weekly publication provides daily counts of tests conducted from 28 May 2020 however <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were only made available from 21 October 2020. From 1 October 2020, the number of pillar 2 swab tests conducted by lower-tier local authority (<abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr>) was made available and from 10 December 2020, weekly breakdowns for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests have been added. This includes whether the test was positive, negative or void and lower-tier local authority breakdowns.</p>

<h3>Types of COVID-19 testing</h3>

<h4>Lab-based virus tests</h4>

<p>These test for the presence of COVID-19 using a swab which is processed in a lab via <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. They are carried out within pillar 1, pillar 2 and pillar 4. This type of test is predominantly used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone who has symptoms</li>
  <li>to confirm a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result</li>
  <li>regular asymptomatic testing in social care</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to increase the capacity of the testing system to produce results, pooling of lab-based virus tests is being piloted within universities and adult social care from October 2020. Multiple swabs from individuals in the same household are grouped at point of swabbing and processed in the lab as one vial, a test result is then issued for all individuals that formed part of the pool. A negative result indicates that all individuals tested negative. A positive result indicates at least one individual is positive and all individuals are subsequently retested individually. Pooled tests are not currently included in the pillar 2 test turnaround time data.</p>

<h4>Antibody tests</h4>

<p>Antibody serology tests test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies. These include pillar 3 tests and antibody tests undertaken within pillar 4.</p>

<h4>Lateral flow device tests</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, often referred to as rapid tests, test for the presence of proteins called ‘antigens’ which are produced by the virus. They are swab tests that give results in 30 minutes or less, without the need for processing in a laboratory. These tests are primarily used for those who do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>LFDs were only made available from 21 October 2020 and were initially available in limited capacity except for areas where rapid testing pilots were conducted. Since then their availability has expanded, initially to a broader range of settings and from 9 April 2021 to everyone in England.</p>

<p>Prior to 27 January 2021, if an individual received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result they were required to take a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to confirm this. Between 27 January and 29 March 2021 this was no longer a requirement except for those self-reporting their test result. From 30 March 2021 the requirement to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was reinstated for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are reported for England only and daily data for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests has been made available from 21 October 2020 on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<h4>Other testing technologies</h4>

<p>Relatively new types of tests are also being made available in certain settings. Similar to <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (<abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr>) technology amplifies genetic material for the purpose of detecting viral RNA associated with the virus that causes COVID-19. Saliva based <abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr> testing allows for self-collection of saliva unlike the swabbing of the nose and throat, required for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing. <abbr title="loop-mediated isothermal amplification">LAMP</abbr> testing is currently used for some NHS asymptomatic staff testing and allows for a greater number of tests to be completed in a shorter time frame.</p>

<h4>Number of tests conducted</h4>

<p>The ‘number of tests conducted’ counts all tests that have remained within the control of the programme (including <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests) and those that have been sent out and subsequently returned to be processed in a lab (such as satellite and home test kits). They are counted at the time they are processed. For a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test this is when the test is processed in a lab, for an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test this when the test was taken.</p>

<p>From 15 April 2021 there has been an improvement to the methodology for the number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted, whereby the data has been deduplicated to ensure an individual test is only counted once. Figures for previous weeks have been revised accordingly and a very small number of tests, less than 1% of the totals, have been removed.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted is reported by the 3 possible results of taking a test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>positive</li>
  <li>negative</li>
  <li>unknown or void</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons for unknown or void tests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the testing within the laboratory was unable to give an exact answer as the test gave an equivocal result (it was not clearly negative or positive)</li>
  <li>there was an issue with the sample when it is delivered to the laboratory making it impossible to return a result, such as the tube was damaged or leaked, the test could not be scanned, the instructions were not followed or the swab was not put in the tube. Due to the issue with the sample, some of these tests may not have been processed by the lab at all</li>
  <li>for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, an unknown or void test result is returned on the device if the test has not run correctly and individuals are advised to take another test</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted are also published by local tier local authority. An individual’s postcode of residence provided by the test subject is used to determine their local authority. Data for City of London and Hackney as well as Cornwall and Isles of Scilly have been combined due to their smaller population size.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2021, the Northamptonshire upper tier local authority has been abolished and replaced with two new unitary authorities: North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire. The lower tier local authorities Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough were incorporated into North Northamptonshire, and Daventry, Northampton borough and South Northamptonshire into West Northamptonshire. This change has been incorporated into the publication from the 15 April release onwards.</p>

<p>Historic data for these abolished authorities is still available in previous releases. For more information on local authority boundaries, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-tier-local-authority-to-upper-tier-local-authority-april-2021-lookup-in-england-and-wales" rel="external">Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal</a>.</p>

<p>These figures are provisional, based on management information for testing. These figures will not align with those published on the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 in the UK dashboard</a> as they are derived from a different data source with different associated methodology. The reasons for the differences are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cut of the data was taken at different points in time for each source</li>
  <li>this report uses the date a test was processed in the laboratory whereas the dashboard reports on the date reported by laboratories</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr> is determined using the postcode of the person tested, the dashboard data is only available at a national level and this is determined by each of the individual devolved administrations</li>
  <li>daily data on the dashboard is not routinely revised figures whereas figures in this report are updated for previous dates when each data cut is taken</li>
</ul>

<h3>Confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</h3>

<h4>Background on confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</h4>

<p>In certain situations, and at certain prevalence levels, a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is recommended to those who have received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result. At times of lower prevalence, the positive predictive value (<abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr> – see section on <abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr> below) of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing is lower and the number of false positives as a proportion of all positive results increases. As prevalence rises, the <abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr> of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing increases and the number of false positives as a proportion of all positive results decreases. The number of false positives as a proportion of all tests carried out should remain broadly the same, regardless of prevalence, at fewer than one in every 1,000.</p>

<p>Prior to 27 January 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing was recommended for all positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. Between 27 January 2021 and 29 March 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were suspended due to high prevalence of COVID-19, except in specific situations such as those self-reporting test results. Confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were reintroduced from 30 March 2021 due to decreasing prevalence and to increase the ability to sequence positive cases in relation to new COVID-19 variants. See the press release about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-reintroduces-confirmatory-pcr-testing" class="govuk-link">reintroduction of confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Confirmatory PCRs for assisted testing and self-reported testing are presented separately in the figures due to the differences in the collection process.</p>

<h4>Positive predictive value</h4>
<p>The positive predictive value (<abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr>) represents the probability that a reported positive result from a COVID-19 test is a true positive. The <abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr> is calculated from the number of true positives divided by the sum of the number of true positives and the number of false positives.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="positive predictive value">PPV</abbr> of a test result will depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in a given setting and the level of virus prevalence in the population being tested.</p>

<h4>Differences between <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test results</h4>

<p>There are a number of possible reasons why the results of the initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and the subsequent confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test may be different. The main ones identified are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>issues in correctly reading or recording the result for LFDs, leading to reporting a positive result when it was negative</li>
  <li>the initial <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> may have incorrectly returned a positive result, which occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 tests</li>
  <li>the confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> may have incorrectly returned a negative result which can occur if the sampling technique was poor – see more information on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gos-impact-of-false-positives-and-negatives-3-june-2020" class="govuk-link">false negatives in <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing</a>
</li>
  <li>the time delay between the taking of the 2 tests means that it is possible for an individual to have correctly tested positive when they took the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and then correctly negative when they took the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> – of all the confirmatory PCRs identified for self-reported LFDs, 85% were taken within one day of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test meaning this is unlikely to be the reason for the negative confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on the sensitivity of <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and likelihood of false results please refer to the research on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lateral-flow-device-specificity-in-phase-4-post-marketing-surveillance">lateral flow device specificity in phase 4 (post-marketing) surveillance</a>.</p>

<h4>Identifying confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests</h4>
<p>The number of confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests is determined by matching positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests for a person to the closest <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test taken within 3 days (inclusive) of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test specimen date.</p>

<p>If an individual has more than one combination of a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and a subsequent <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test within 3 days, then each combination per positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test will be counted in these figures.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are linked to <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests using multiple pieces of personal information such as name, date of birth, and NHS number. Positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests not matched include those where the test could not be linked to a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test or where the individual did not take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. 
If a person has had more than 3 confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, this is deemed as an unusually high frequency. Individuals that report more than 3 confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests within 3 days are removed from the underlying confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> data.</p>

<p>This methodology for identifying confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests is based on matching individual <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests taken by the same person. This is not the same as the matching process which is carried out within the contact tracing system which occurs after an individual receives a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test.</p>

<h3>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in education settings</h3>

<h4>Primary schools and nurseries</h4>

<p>Since 18 January 2021, on-site staff in primary schools, school-based nurseries, and state-maintained nurseries have been able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> twice weekly at home. From mid-March this was expanded to all private, voluntary and independent nurseries. Primary and nursery staff self-report their test result, therefore if an individual receives a positive result, they are then required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Primary school students are not currently being tested. This is because serious COVID-related illness is extremely rare in children and there is lower case rates and transmissions in younger children in comparison to secondary school children. Primary school aged children are likely to find repeated testing unpleasant and parents may find it challenging to repeatedly swab young children.</p>

<h4>Secondary schools and colleges</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing within secondary schools and colleges was implemented for on-site staff from 4 January 2021. Staff were expected to take a test once a week initially. However the guidance was updated at the start of the national lockdown to twice-weekly testing for those staff attending schools and colleges. Initially, secondary school staff testing was assisted via the use of an asymptomatic test site, however from 25 February they were encouraged to use home test kits. From the 8 March testing was expanded to all secondary school staff and students. On their return to school, students are required to take 3 tests (spaced 3 to 5 days apart) at their onsite asymptomatic test centre. Following this, they then begin twice weekly home testing. For more information see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mass-testing-for-secondary-pupils-as-all-schools-and-colleges-fully-reopenfrom8-march">mass testing for secondary pupils</a>.</p>

<h4>Households and bubbles of school students and staff</h4>

<p>From 1 March 2021 households, childcare and support bubbles of primary and secondary school students and staff are able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test twice a week. Tests taken by these individuals are reported within the figures for the school they are associated with. There are numerous ways these groups of individuals can receive a test. For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rapid-lateral-flow-testing-for-households-and-bubbles-of-school-pupils-and-staff" class="govuk-link">rapid lateral flow testing for households and bubbles of school pupils and staff</a>.</p>

<h4>Higher education</h4>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing was implemented by higher education providers from 27 November 2020 to support the safe travel of students over the winter break. Tests taken prior to this were part of testing pilots. In January twice weekly asymptomatic testing was introduced for staff and students accessing university facilities. This was delivered through supervised on-site asymptomatic testing sites. Asymptomatic testing has continued into the summer term and, from May, providers are able to set up <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> collection points to enable students and staff to test at home and self-report their result. All students returning to university from 17 May are encouraged to take 3 tests (3 to 4 days apart) at an on-site test facility, where available, before testing twice a week on-site or at home thereafter. For more information on testing in higher education please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses" class="govuk-link">higher education COVID-19 guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests by phase of education and individual role</h4>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the education sector are reported with a breakdown per phase of education and role (staff, student, household bubble and support bubble). <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result breakdowns are reported by the date the test result was communicated.</p>

<p>Primary school, schools-based nurseries and maintained nursery school data is collected from the self-reporting process. Secondary school and college data is identified from asymptomatic test sites linked to schools, and by linking information captured by the individuals when they self-report to data held for each institution. Secondary school and college figures also include tests not registered (see the section ‘data quality for testing in education’ below for more information). Data for higher education establishments is identified from tests taken at their asymptomatic test sites and from May also includes self-reported tests linked to the higher education providers.</p>

<p>For tests taken prior to 5 March, the individual role (staff or student) is determined using age as a proxy. An individual aged 20 or over is categorised as a staff member and under 20 a student. This method is not appropriate for colleges and higher education and therefore is not included. From 5 March, the self-test registration process will soon gathers this information and determines on whether someone is a staff member, student, part of a household, childcare or support bubble. The figures for tests taken by school household bubbles and school support bubbles are therefore only available from 5 March. Students and staff can also get tested at an asymptomatic test site (<abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>), tests taken via this route continue to use age as proxy for staff and students.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by phase of education will not be directly comparable to the number of tests conducted in England. There are a number of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source for the number of LFDs by phase of education is different</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests by phase of education test result uses different metrics to segregate data for England from the UK</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data quality for testing in education</h4>

<p>Testing in primary schools, schools-based nurseries, maintained nursery schools, secondary schools and colleges is carried out using self-report <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, hence the level of data quality and accuracy is entirely reliant on subjects reporting the result of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and completing the testing journey.</p>

<p>For tests taken after 25 February, reference data from the Department of Education is used to determine the phase of education. For some tests where there is a lack of information captured, the test cannot be linked to a type of school. For the purposes of this report, these tests are reported separately as unidentified phase of education. In addition, a small number of secondary school tests prior to the 31 December 2020 have been excluded due to pilots not reporting digitally.</p>

<p>Age is used as a proxy for individual role for any tests prior to 5 March or where a test was taken at an <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>. Note, only students and staff are able to test at an <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr> and not household or support bubbles.</p>

<p>Higher education reference data is used to determine which tests were taken in higher education providers. Given the decentralised site creation, there is no immediate visibility of new sites but these are incorporated into the data over time.</p>

<p>Tests not registered refers to tests which have been taken. However the individual has not digitally registered their test. This means these tests cannot be linked back to individuals in the system and a limited amount of information is captured. From 25 March the methodology has improved to identify which phase of education these tests belong to. Almost all tests not registered are attributed to secondary schools and colleges as they arise from on-site testing. The number of tests not registered are reported separately in the figures for secondary schools and colleges, and are included in the totals. The total tests for secondary schools and colleges for all previous weeks has been revised accordingly. A very small number of tests not registered belong to other phases of education and therefore these are not included.</p>

<h2>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home settings</h2>

<p>The number of tests conducted in care homes includes staff, residents and visitors tested via kits directly sent to the care home. It will not include care home staff, residents or visitors who are tested via a different route (for example, at a regional or local test site, mobile testing unit). The figures related to adult care homes and children’s care homes are excluded.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests are counted on the day the test result was communicated. These figures only include tests which were registered, therefore if tests were taken but not registered online by the care home or individual then these will not be counted.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted is reported by type of test and by the individual role (staff, resident, visitor and visiting professional) which is captured when the test is registered. For some tests a limited amount of information is available therefore the individual role cannot be determined. These tests are reported separately in the data tables.</p>

<p>Due to the change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff, the requirement for care home staff to register negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive. As a result, a proportion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<h3>Background on testing in care homes</h3>

<h4>Staff</h4>

<p>Routine asymptomatic testing of care home staff began on 7 June 2020 with weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for staff. Enhanced testing began from 23 December 2020 with twice weekly rapid lateral flow tests for staff and rapid response testing in the event of a positive test result for 7 days.</p>

<p>From 16 February 2021, the rapid response testing was extended to cover daily rapid lateral flow testing for all staff until 5 days without a positive test result occur. Whole home <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing is undertaken in the event of an outbreak, first on day 1 and then again between day 4 to 7 of the outbreak.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> can also use rapid lateral flow tests alongside PCRs for all staff at their discretion.</p>

<h4>Residents</h4>

<p>Routine testing of care home residents began on 7 June 2020 with monthly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for residents.</p>

<p>Whole home testing in the event of an outbreak was available from 22 January 2021, with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing undertaken first on day 1 and then again between day 4 to 7 of the outbreak. From 16 February 2021 <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> can also use rapid lateral flow tests alongside PCRs for all residents at their discretion.</p>

<h4>Care home visitors</h4>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests were made available to some care homes for visitors to test on arrival for a visit from 2 December 2020. From 14 December 2020 this was rolled out to all care homes and all visitors were required to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on arrival. Indoor visiting was suspended on 6 January 2021 in line with national lockdown restrictions. Throughout the period of national restrictions, visits were limited to outdoors, in visiting pods or with a substantial screen; as well as those in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<p>From 21 June 2021, care homes residents can nominate 5 named visitors each, with 2 visitors being able to visit each day. These visitors should be tested using <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests on the day of every visit and produce a negative COVID test prior to their visit. Residents with the highest care and support needs can also have regular visits from an ‘essential care giver’ who will access the same testing arrangements as members of staff, that is a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and (at least) twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Care home visiting professionals <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors</h4>

<p>From 14 December 2020 <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors should take a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. From 22 March 2021 they should also conduct a lateral flow test prior to their inspection visit.</p>

<h4>All other professionals</h4>

<p>From 14 December 2020 all other professionals not already tested through regular NHS staff testing or <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors should be tested using a lateral flow test at the care home door immediately prior to a visit.</p>

<h4>Additional information on testing in care homes</h4>

<p>Following NHS guidance, issued on 16 February 2021, there is a window following a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result when care home staff, residents, and visiting professionals will not be tested. The window is 90 days from the onset of symptoms or, if asymptomatic when tested, 90 days after taking the positive test. This minimises additional positive results, which may be considered unnecessary as individuals are unlikely to be infectious. If the individual develops new symptoms during this window they will be immediately tested using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also publishes care home testing data in the monthly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monthly-statistics-for-adult-social-care-england" class="govuk-link">Adult social care in England statistics</a>. This publication uses the same data source but has a different methodology for presenting testing in care homes and differences in the figures will occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<h4>1.Differences in which tests from different routes are included</h4>
<p>Both methodologies include the number of tests registered from kits sent directly to care homes, but the monthly Adult Social Care in England publication additionally includes care home staff or residents tested via other routes such as regional or local test sites. As a result, figures in this report will be substantially lower for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home staff due to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes">current guidance recommending staff with symptoms to be tested outside of the care home</a></p>

<h4>2.Different reporting periods</h4>
<p>This publication uses the date the test result was received in comparison to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology">Adult Social Care in England statistics</a> which use the start time of the test</p>

<h4>3.Different times of extracting the data</h4>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by NHS staff</h3>

<p>Staff in primary care test at home using a self-test <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> kit twice weekly. They are required to report their result through the national testing programme digital infrastructure, using the online digital too. However, this is entirely dependent on the individual, therefore some underreporting is expected.</p>

<p>Staff in NHS trusts similarly self-test at home twice weekly but their test results are collated by their employer and not through the national testing programme digital infrastructure. The NHS trust then submits data for their staff to NHS Digital, which is separate to reporting through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure. This separate reporting system was established this way as NHS secondary care providers began testing with LFDs before the NHS Digital reporting solution was built. Because of this, the figures for NHS trusts are not included in the national figures for the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted reported via this route.</p>

<p>There are known differences in the completeness of the information provided by different NHS trusts and the data collection process is dependent on the organisations submitting this information to NHS Digital. It is possible that there is some duplication of test results within the figures where NHS trusts have reported the same results more than once in a given week. This is more likely to affect results up to 24 March before all NHS trusts moved to a weekly submission through NHS Digital. However, where possible duplicates are identified and removed.</p>

<p>The timing of the weekly process of submission by NHS trusts means that data for the latest week is not available. Figures for tests conducted by staff in NHS trusts are therefore published with an additional week’s lag in comparison to the rest of the data in this publication.</p>

<p>In addition, approximately 6,000 tests reported by staff in NHS trusts cannot be attributed to a test date or have a test date prior to the introduction of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing, these are excluded from the figures. This is due to issues which arose during the data collection process from NHS trusts prior to 25 March.</p>

<h4>Background information for NHS staff</h4>

<h5>NHS primary care staff</h5>

<p>Primary care services provide the first point of contact in the healthcare system, acting as the ‘front door’ of the NHS. Primary care includes general practice, community pharmacy, dental and optometry (eye health) services. NHS staff in primary care were able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test twice weekly since December 2020.</p>

<h5>Staff in NHS trusts</h5>

<p>NHS trusts include acute and specialist hospitals, community, mental health and learning disability and ambulance services. Staff in NHS trusts were able to get twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests from November 2020.</p>

<h5>Other NHS staff</h5>

<p>Other NHS staff includes those working in the independent sector delivering NHS commissioned services or outside of primary care and NHS trusts. Staff in NHS-commissioned services in the independent sector were able to take twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests from January 2021.</p>

<h3>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in workplace settings</h3>

<p>The number of tests conducted in private and public sector workplaces only includes tests which have been used and subsequently registered, either at an asymptomatic test site or via self-report at home. In addition, the number of tests conducted in private sector workplaces only includes kits directly sent to private companies.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in private and public sector workplace settings at an asymptomatic testing site are identified by the organisation’s Unique Organisation Number. Test conducted via self-report as part of workplace testing are identified as users can declare the organisation for which they took the test.</p>

<h3>Background on testing in private sector workplace settings</h3>

<p>Since early November, staff in private and public sector workplace settings have been able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test at an assisted testing site, however initially this was limited to staff in those organisations participating in testing pilots. Similarly, public sector staff began testing at home during a 5-week trial period in March, after which it was expanded to all government departments. From 6 April, at-home testing was rolled out to staff in private sector workplaces. Staff undertaking self-testing are asked to report their results through the national testing programme digital infrastructure, using the online digital tool. However, some underreporting is expected.</p>

<p>The figures in this report cover <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests registered through the National Testing Programme digital infrastructure, this includes on-site testing and self-testing, provided by NHS Test and Trace. Private sector companies can carry out testing using privately procured tests, these tests are reported via a different system and are not included in the figures. It is possible that some NHS tests may have been registered through this route and will therefore not be counted here, however, this is estimated to be a small proportion of all the tests conducted.</p>

<p>Public sector workplaces refers to staff working in government departments. This includes organisations such as the Department for Transport, the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Defence. Initially, tests were made available via asymptomatic test sites, however from the beginning of March testing migrated to home <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> self-reporting. The majority of tests are taken by staff, however in some instances individuals affiliated with an organisation may also get tested. These figures do not include tests taken by haulier; they are published separately by the Department for Transport at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/haulier-coronavirus-testing">Haulier COVID-19 testing</a>.</p>

<h2>How the data in this bulletin can be used</h2>

<p>This data can be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>determine the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace in contacting people with COVID-19 and their close contacts</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>monitor the number of outbreaks (cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) occurring in England and comparing this to cases are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>approximate the size of the population who should be self-isolating each week</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>calculate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the wider population</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>determine compliance of the population with COVID-19 guidance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>compare tracing services across nations due to differences in definitions and methodologies</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on interpreting weekly data</h3>

<p>Each weekly update provides a snapshot of the cases and contacts completed within the 7-day period. The most recently reported week should be treated with some caution, as this data may be revised in the time series on the next release.</p>

<p>The statistics will be updated as more data becomes available and reportable. These are experimental statistics that are in the testing phase and not yet fully developed.</p>

<h3>Notes on interpreting against other statistics</h3>

<p>Historic figures for testing in the UK were available in the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> daily time series data but stopped being updated after 20 August 2020. Statistics on deaths, tests and cases are published daily in the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/?_ga=2.265749707.532009857.1592816143-2145795025.1590065527" class="govuk-link">UK COVID-19 dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Figures in the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> dashboard will be consistent with those published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports?">NHS Test and Trace weekly bulletins</a>. However, figures may not always exactly align due to the timing of data cuts. In addition, the dashboard reports positive cases deduplicated across the whole of Test and Trace. The weekly NHS Test and Trace reports positive cases deduplicated across each weekly period. As a different methodology is used, these figures will not align.</p>

<p>Tests processed are reported in this publication and tests conducted are reported on the dashboard. These will not align as tests processed counts all tests processed in a lab whereas tests conducted includes all tests (swab, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and antibody tests), some of which are not processed in a lab.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be open and transparent with the public it serves, these data are being released at the earliest possible opportunity. However, new IT systems and statistical outputs often take some time to bed in. This data should therefore be treated with caution while the system and our understanding of the data develops.</p>

<p>At this early stage, there is a risk of data entry errors or delay, which may require that data are revised and updated in subsequent publications. The process of finding and removing duplicate records may also need refining, which could result in revisions to the data.</p>

<h3>Quality assurance</h3>

<p>There are many stages of quality assurance in place to ensure the production process results in high quality outputs.</p>

<h4>Input data</h4>

<p>When the input data is received it is checked to ensure it is up to date, and there are no clear issues with it before the process begins.</p>

<h4>The production code</h4>

<p>This is originally written by one person and then rigorously tested and peer-reviewed by another individual before being used in the production process. When changes are made or new code is produced, this same process is followed before it’s used.</p>

<h4>Outputs</h4>

<p>Tables are compared to previous outputs to check for larger revisions than should be expected and are also compared to other sources of similar information.</p>

<h4>Text in the bulletin</h4>

<p>Text changes in the bulletin are made by one person and are then checked and cleared by another person afterwards.</p>

      <p>Between 30 November 2020 and 26 January 2021, those with a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test must have also had a positive confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test to trigger contact tracing. Between 27 January 2021 and 29 March 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were suspended and a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test triggered contact tracing.
