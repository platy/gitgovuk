<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) publishes weekly statistics on NHS Test and Trace (England). This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics for testing and contact tracing in England. These statistics cover:</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace, England:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of people tested for coronavirus in England</li>
  <li>number of people who tested positive for coronavirus in England</li>
  <li>time taken for test results to become available in England</li>
  <li>distance to take a test in-person in England</li>
  <li>number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England that were then transferred to the contact-tracing system, and the time taken for them to be reached</li>
  <li>number of recent close contacts identified, and the time taken for them to be reached</li>
  <li>number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and pillar 2 <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in England</li>
</ul>

<p>This document primarily sets out information on the data sources and methodology used to generate the statistics for testing and contact tracing in England.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is consolidating where COVID-19 testing statistics are published to make it easier to find the latest data. From 17 December 2020, this publication no longer includes information on coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in the UK. This information can instead be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>. Statistics on positive cases are published daily on the dashboard and weekly in the NHS Test and Trace publication.</p>

<p>These statistics have been produced quickly in response to developing world events. The Office for Statistics Regulation, on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority, has reviewed them against several important aspects of the <a rel="external" href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> and regards them as consistent with the code’s 3 pillars of trustworthiness, quality and value.</p>

<h2>NHS Test and Trace, England</h2>

<p>This section covers the methodology for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace statistical bulletin</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace data tables</li>
  <li>NHS Test and Trace regional breakdowns</li>
  <li>Demographic and regional information for people tested and testing positive</li>
</ul>

<p>For information on <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted and the rapid asymptomatic testing bulletin see the <a href="#tests-conducted-england" class="govuk-link">Tests conducted, England</a> section below.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace in England was launched on 28 May 2020 and ensures that anyone who develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) can quickly be tested to find out if they have the virus. It then helps trace recent close contacts of anyone who tests positives for coronavirus and, if necessary, notifies them that they must self-isolate at home to help stop the spread of the virus. The flow of how people move through the NHS Test and Trace service is shown in <a class="govuk-link" href="#figure-1">figure 1</a>. More information about NHS Test and Trace can be found in the guidance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works" class="govuk-link">NHS Test and Trace: how it works</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> publishes weekly statistics on NHS Test and Trace. The purpose of this data is to provide a weekly update on the implementation and performance of NHS Test and Trace. Data collected for the Test and Trace programme is primarily for operational purposes and was not designed to track the spread of the virus. Studies into the spread of the virus in the UK are carried out by the Office for National Statistics (<abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>). Further guidance can be found in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comparing-methods-used-in-the-covid-19-infection-survey-and-nhs-test-and-trace-england--2">comparing methods used in the COVID-19 Infection Survey and NHS Test and Trace, England</a>.</p>

<p>A list of data sources relating to the coronavirus pandemic in the UK can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-statistics-and-analysis" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) statistics and analysis</a>. A breakdown of all available testing and contact-tracing data in the UK can be found at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-and-contact-tracing-in-the-uk-summary-of-data">testing and contact tracing in the UK: summary of data</a>.</p>

<h4>Figure 1: flowchart showing how people move through NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/107359/figure-1-test-trace-flowchart-29-Oct-2020.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<p>The diagram shows the journey a person can take through the NHS Test and Trace service. For pillar 1, this starts with a person having a coronavirus test in hospital. For pillar 2, this starts with a person booking or ordering a coronavirus test. Pillar 2 tests can be either be conducted at a regional test site, local test site or mobile test unit; or a satellite or home test can be conducted. For pillar 4, this starts with a person having a coronavirus test as part of a prevalence study (those who are tested as part of anonymous studies do not get passed on to contact tracing). After tests have been taken, they are sent to a laboratory for processing. Once processed, a person will be emailed or texted their result.</p>

<p>If a person has a positive COVID-19 test result, their case is transferred to the NHS Test and Trace service and can be managed in one of 2 ways. First, cases that are not managed by local health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) are reached either online or by a call centre. They are then asked to provide details of recent close contacts. These recent close contacts are then reached by the NHS Test and Trace service and advised to self-isolate. In regions with additional local contact-tracing teams, if the national team cannot make contact with a resident within a set period of time, then local public health officials can use the data provided by NHS Test and Trace to follow up.</p>

<p>Second, cases that are linked to certain exposure settings are escalated to local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> who work to identify and reach recent close contacts and advise them to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Additionally, if the person has the app and used the app to book their test, their positive result is updated automatically. If they have the app but booked their test via a different route then they can use a link to add their positive result to the app. Once their positive result is entered into the app, the person is asked if they are willing to share their data and if they say yes, the app identifies other app users who have been in close contact with the person who has tested positive. Close contacts then receive an app notification to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Since 21 October 2020, data from a new route for getting tested using lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests has been made available. Between 30 November 2020 and 26 January 2021, only individuals with positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests were transferred to contact tracing. This is because those with positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests were instructed to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. From 27 January 2021, confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing was temporarily removed for positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests taken at general public test sites due to the high level of coronavirus infections in England. From this date, a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result will trigger the start of contact tracing. Confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing procedures are still in place for NHS England staff, adult social care, primary school staff and hauliers.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>NHS Test and Trace is for England only, therefore the figures in this section are given for England only. Similar programmes are in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland but this data is not part of the NHS Test and Trace programme and is owned and managed by Public Health Scotland, the Welsh government and the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency respectively. Information is available at their statistics release pages: <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://beta.isdscotland.org/find-publications-and-data/population-health/covid-19/covid-19-statistical-report/">Test and Protect in Scotland</a>; <a href="https://gov.wales/test-trace-protect-contact-tracing-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Test, Trace, Protect in Wales</a>; and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-tracing-covid-19/contact-tracing-service-management-information" rel="external">Contact tracing in Northern Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<p>This data is collected from management information generated during the operation of the NHS Test and Trace service. The different data streams are collated centrally by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>. Testing data is collected from Public Health England and the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is taken from data collected and stored by commercial partners.</p>

<h3>Timings and revisions</h3>

<p>Figures given in previous releases are routinely revised each week going back to the start of Test and Trace for people tested for COVID-19, people testing positive for COVID-19, pillar 2 testing turnaround times, distance to in-person test site and contact tracing.</p>

<p>The figures presented are based on a data cut several days after the end of the reporting period. This is to give time for data relating to the end of the 7-day period to be collected. Some data may continue to be collected after this period, and therefore may need to be revised over time.</p>

<h3>Time series</h3>
<p>Data is released as a time series of weekly data that is updated each week. Historic data may be revised if more accurate information is available later (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#timings">Timings and revisions</a> above). This means that individual figures will not necessarily align with what was published earlier on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3>Testing in England</h3>
<p>NHS Test and Trace starts with an individual taking a swab test, either in pillar 1, pillar 2 or pillar 4. Those who go on to test positive<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link">[footnote 1]</a></sup> will have their case transferred to NHS Test and Trace for contact tracing. The majority of these are people who were tested under pillar 1 or pillar 2 of the government testing strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pillar 1: swab testing for the virus in <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers</li>
  <li>pillar 2: swab testing for the virus in the wider population, through commercial partnerships <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, either processed in a lab or more rapidly via <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</li>
  <li>pillar 3 testing: serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had coronavirus</li>
  <li>pillar 4 testing: blood and swab testing for national surveillance support by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> and research, academic and scientific partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, more information is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-surveillance" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 surveillance</a> guidance<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a legal requirement that all positive cases are reported to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, irrespective of pillar. As such, when pillar 4 research studies (for swab testing) identify positive cases, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> is notified and this data flows into the Surveillance system. This means that currently all positive cases identified by pillar 4 surveillance studies are captured under pillar 1 or 2, and are transferred to NHS Test and Trace. The same applies to those tested as part of the volunteer testing network: they are reported to <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> under pillar 1 and any positive cases are transferred to NHS Test and Trace. Pillar 3 (serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had COVID-19) are not transferred to NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>Once conducted, tests are processed and the results are sent back to the individual through an email or an SMS.</p>

<p>Between 30 November 2020 and 26 January 2021, anyone who received a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result was instructed to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. The individual and their household were advised to self-isolate from the point of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result being received. Contact tracing would then be initiated if a positive <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was received. If a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> was received after a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>, the individual and their household were advised they no longer needed to self-isolate. This has changed as of 27 January 2021: a positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test will now initiate contact tracing without requirement for a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test and the individual and their household are advised to self-isolate from the point of the positive <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> result being received. For more information on the types of test see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-coronavirus-testing">Types of coronavirus testing</a> section below.</p>

<h4>People tested and people testing positive</h4>
<p>For both pillars 1 and 2, data for England is provided by the NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and the number of confirmed cases is collated to give the total number of confirmed cases over the reporting period. The headline figures reported in this publication for people tested and people testing positive include both lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests and polymerase chain reaction (<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>) tests, deduplicated for each reporting week.</p>

<p>More details about the data sources and methodology for pillar 1 and pillar 2 can be found in the section <a href="#section-3" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in the UK</a>. Individuals with negative results from pooled tests are included in these figures. Individuals with positive results from pooled tests are excluded, however the results from re-tests for those individuals are included.</p>

<h4>From 15 October 2020, the methodology for people tested and people testing positive has changed.</h4>

<p>Previously, the number of people newly tested and newly testing positive was reported, where the figures were deduplicated over the entirety of the pandemic so an individual would only appear once. This meant someone tested in March and again in September would only be counted in the March counts. This was progressively becoming less meaningful the longer the duration of the pandemic and meant that it was not appropriate to calculate a positivity rate from this data.</p>

<p>Figures are now reported as people tested and people testing positive at least once in the reporting week. People tested or testing positive are only counted once over the 7-day reporting period (Thursday to Wednesday), with a positive test being prioritised over a negative test. A person can be counted within more than one 7-day reporting period. If someone was tested more than once in different reporting weeks, they would be included in the count for all reporting weeks they were tested in.</p>

<p>For example, if a person was tested on Thursday and Friday of the same week, they would only be counted once in the reporting week. However, if someone was tested on Tuesday and Friday of the same week, that individual would be counted in 2 reporting periods, as the 2 tests fall into different 7-day reporting periods. If a person is tested under both pillar 1 and pillar 2 in the same reporting week, then only the pillar they were first tested under is counted, unless they were tested in both pillars on the same day, in which case, they are counted under pillar 2.</p>

<p>If someone had both a positive and a negative result in the same week, only the positive case would be counted, with the result being counted in pillar associated with the positive result. All previous reporting weeks have been backdated and revised with the new methodology.</p>

<p>When deduplicating within the reporting period, people have been matched using a fuzzy matching process. This involves using a combination of name, NHS number and date of birth to find duplicates and then remove them. Due to the nature of the matching, this will not always be a perfect match and there may sometimes be more people removed than necessary, for example, if someone has the same name and date of birth. However, this should only affect a small number of tests.</p>

<p>Demographic and regional data for people tested and people testing positive at least once in the reporting week is available in the weekly collection page. This data has been updated to account for the change in methodology for people tested and people testing positive. Demographic information is published for age, gender, <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> and <abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr>. For pillar 1, data is collected by the hospital, and is then enriched using patient records. For pillar 2, this data is collected when people register for a test and is voluntary, which means that people have the option not to provide their information. Note that for age, a person may fall into more than one age group if their age has changed between reporting weeks in which they were tested.</p>

<p>From 7 January 2021 this data will be available for those tested using <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests only. This is to ensure the positivity rate remains comparable over time (see the <a href="#weekly-positivity-rate" class="govuk-link">Weekly positivity rate</a> section for more information). Age and gender breakdowns for positive cases that include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>From 19 November 2020, regional information is derived using the person’s address recorded in the laboratory information systems at the time of testing. Before this a person’s NHS Summary Care record was used. This change was applied to historical data since 1 September 2020 and has been revised. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-comparison-of-geographic-allocation-of-cases-in-england-by-lower-tier-local-authority" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: comparison of geographic allocation of cases in England by lower-tier local authority</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The totals provided for people tested and people testing positive in the demographic tables will not align with the total number of people tested and people testing positive given in the main publication. This is due to the exclusion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests in the demographic tables in addition to differences in when the data is taken, which means that one source may be more up to date than the other.</p>

<p>The cumulative number of people newly testing positive (deduplicated over the entirety of the pandemic) is available on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>. The cumulative number of people tested is given in the publication commentary. This gives the total number of people tested and testing positive at least once since the beginning of the pandemic, as well as the proportion of the population that has been tested at least once.</p>

<p>Data provided in the release only gives the cumulative number of people who have ever been tested since Test and Trace launched, so anyone who was tested before 28 May 2020 will not be included.</p>

<h4>Weekly positivity rate</h4>

<p>It is no longer recommended that the headline figures for people tested and people testing positive are used to calculate a positivity rate.&nbsp;This is because it’s likely that <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests have a different positivity rate to <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the&nbsp;use of LFDs&nbsp;in rapid testing. As the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;is&nbsp;increasing over time, a consistent positivity rate cannot be calculated. From 7 January 2021, the weekly positivity rate will no longer be calculated as part of this publication but&nbsp;can&nbsp;instead&nbsp;be found on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/testing?areaType=nation&amp;areaName=England">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a> for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> only positive cases in England.&nbsp;As this is for <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests only, the positivity rate is comparable over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, from 7 January 2021,&nbsp;the breakdown for the number&nbsp;of people&nbsp;tested and number of people&nbsp;testing positive in each reporting week, by age, gender and local authority&nbsp;(found on the weekly collection page)&nbsp;will&nbsp;only include those who have tested positive from a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. This ensures&nbsp;the positivity rates calculated are consistent over time.&nbsp;Age and gender breakdowns for positive cases&nbsp;that include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests can be found on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Note that these <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>-only positivity rates should not be used as a measure of prevalence for the general public as people tested using a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test is still not a random sample and is instead focused on people who may be more likely to have COVID-19. Additionally, it will not be an accurate measure of prevalence for the general public as some people will be asymptomatic and not all people who experience COVID-19 symptoms will get tested.</p>

<p>More information about the estimated number of people who have COVID-19 at a given time can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-covid-19-surveillance-reports" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> surveillance reports</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/latest#covid-19-infection-survey-data" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Coronavirus Infection Survey pilot</a>.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is included in the weekly NHS Test and Trace publication for both pillar 1 and pillar 2 testing in England. This is important for the implementation and performance of NHS Test and Trace as it ensures that people who have tested positive can notify their contacts as quickly as possible to help prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>For both pillar 1 and pillar 2 turnaround times, the total number of test results reported (and the time taken to do so) is not the same as the number of people tested.</p>

<p>For clinical reasons, some people are tested more than once. Therefore, the number of tests will be higher than the number of people tested. There are several valid reasons why some individuals may be tested more than once, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regular testing of health and care workers</li>
  <li>individuals who have the virus, test positive, and have a subsequent test to see if they can return to work</li>
  <li>participation in early trials comparing healthcare professionals administered tests with self-administered tests, resulting in 2 results on the same day</li>
  <li>participation in research studies conducting routine tests on the same people each month</li>
  <li>some tests may come back as ‘void’ and a retest would be issued</li>
  <li>individuals with early symptoms who test negative, develop more symptoms and are retested and found to be positive</li>
</ul>

<p>The data for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result has not been deduplicated. This means that the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given for all tests that have been taken, including those tests that have been carried out on the same person more than once.</p>

<h4>Pillar 1 testing turnaround times</h4>

<p>Pillar 1 testing includes swab testing in <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers. These tests are conducted in hospitals and outbreak locations. The data is recorded by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and NHS labs and covers England only, in line with the tracing data. The location is based on the laboratory site where the test was processed, which is usually an NHS hospital.</p>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result through pillar 1 is only available from 9 July 2020 due to differences in the reporting methodologies for NHS and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> labs. Before this, data regarding the time taken to receive a COVID-19 result is not comparable across <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and NHS labs. For consistency with other government publications, only comparable data has been included in order to give an overall picture for pillar 1.</p>

<p>There remain a small number of study samples and tests from private laboratories which are excluded from turnaround time figures as no timing data is available. Generally, these tests make up less than 5% of the tests conducted and so their absence should not greatly affect the overall totals.</p>

<p>As some pillar 1 tests are provided to hospital patients, it is not practical for those administering the tests to record the exact time at which the test was taken. Therefore, the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is measured from the time that a test is received by a laboratory for processing to the time when the results are published to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given as the number of tests results available within and after 24hrs of the test being received. This definition differs from those used for pillar 2 so the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result cannot be compared across pillar 1 and pillar 2.</p>

<p>The number of tests included in the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is consistent with testing data published on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK dashboard</a>. The pillar 1 tests by nation on coronavirus in the UK gives the pillar 1 tests for England daily and the sum of these over the given period will be consistent with the statistics provided here. However, the number of tests will not match exactly due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the small number of study samples and tests from private laboratories that have been excluded from the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result, but which are included in the pillar 1 tests by nation</li>
  <li>differences in when the data is taken, which means that one source may be more up to date than the other</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pillar 2 testing turnaround times</h4>

<p>There are various routes for getting tested within pillar 2 (national swab testing). Data on the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result for pillar 2 is presented for all routes combined and split up to reflect the different routes, as this impacts on the turnaround times. Note that this data does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests. The routes for taking a test through pillar 2 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>regional test sites, which includes drive-through testing centres</li>
  <li>local test sites, which are similar to regional test sites but specifically for walk ups</li>
  <li>mobile testing units, which travel around the UK to increase access to coronavirus testing. They respond to need, travelling to test people at specific sites including care homes, police stations and prisons</li>
  <li>satellite test centres, which includes test kits provided directly to ‘satellite’ centres at places like care homes or hospitals that have a particularly urgent or significant need. The majority of tests from satellite test centres are care home tests</li>
  <li>home test kits, which are delivered to someone’s door so they can test themselves and their family without leaving the house</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, local test sites were included together with regional test sites but from 17 September 2020 they have been split out as a separate group.</p>

<p>From 4 March, new satellite sub-channels have been included within the satellite test turnaround time data. These new sub-channels make up approximately 5% of the total number of satellite tests and includes satellite tests used by schools, hospices and within domiciliary care. From 18 March further sub-channels have been included to the satellite channel, making up 0.1% of the total number of satellite tests. This includes tests used in adult day-care centres and arrivals from red countries. Data previously published for satellite testing turnaround times have been revised to include these new routes.</p>

<p>From 18 March, new sub-channels have been included within the home test turnaround time data. These new sub-channels make up approximately 8% of the total number of home tests and includes tests used in schools, for arrivals from amber countries and in vaccine trials. Data previously published for home testing turnaround times have been revised to include these new routes.</p>

<p>The data for pillar 2 has been taken for England only, in line with the tracing data. There are differences in the way that the location of a test is allocated depending upon the route for taking the test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, the location of the testing site is used to assign the location of the person being tested. This means that any tests carried out at test sites in England will be included, even though this may include tests of people who were tested in England but live outside of England and may exclude tests of people who live in England but have been tested outside of England</li>
  <li>for home testing and satellite test centres, people’s home addresses are used to assign the location of the person being tested. Note: this methodology has changed from using the location of the lab that processes the test, which was used until the start of August 2020. Previous figures have been revised to take into account the new methodology</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing turnaround times data does not include Randox tests, as these are handled through a different system. This will not affect the data for regional test sites, local test sites, mobile testing units or home test kits, but Randox tests made up a significant proportion of the tests conducted in care homes, which form part of the satellite test centres. Until 16 July 2020, Randox tests made up just under 40% of the tests used in care homes. However, their use is being phased out and from 17 July 2020 these tests make up less than 5% of the tests conducted in care homes.</p>

<p>The number of tests included in the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result will not be the same as the total number of people tested for COVID-19. In addition to the general reasons stated in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#time-taken">Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result</a> section, there are a number of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is different. The number of people tested and testing positive for COVID-19 is taken from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, whilst the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is taken from commercial partners</li>
  <li>the data for the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result has not been deduplicated. This means that the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is given for all tests that have been taken, including those tests that have been carried out on the same person more than once</li>
  <li>the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result uses different metrics to segregate data for England from the UK</li>
  <li>the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result is reported by the date the test was registered whereas people tested are reported against the specimen date</li>
</ul>

<p>Turnaround times are measured and reported in 2 ways: time taken from booking a test and from taking a test to receiving a test result. Details are given below. From 27 August 2020, median turnaround times are reported for both measures, in addition to the usual turnaround time windows, such as within 24 hours. For all measures the test is recorded against the date the test was registered.</p>

<p>For all measures of time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result, there are a number of test results that were not received. This covers any test where the results were not communicated, which may be because communication details (for example, phone number or email address) were not provided or were incorrect, or because the test was cancelled or abandoned, or no result was available. It also includes some tests that are still being processed. Some of these people may still have been passed into the contact-tracing system, but the data from the pillar 2 test does not show that their tests were complete. From 17 September 2020 the number of results not received was split to show those which were unsuccessful and those still in progress. Previously these were reported together.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of test</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of test is measured from the time a person completes a test registration (or the time a person indicates their test was taken for home testing kits) until the time that they receive a notification of the result of their test via an email or an SMS. The time that a person completes their test registration should reflect the approximate time that the person took their test, but the accuracy of this will vary depending upon the route that they used to take the test.</p>

<p>For home testing kits, the start time is measured from the time a person inputs that they took their test (note that this process changed from the time a test was registered using a barcode scan, from July 2020 onwards). When a person registers their test, they are asked to give the time that their test was taken. This measure is self-reported but allows current and previous data to be measured using the same definition and allows for a more accurate end-to-end time to be calculated.</p>

<p>For regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, registration is completed before the test in a controlled environment and so for most tests this provides a precise measure of when the test was taken.</p>

<p>For satellite test centres, the time of test registration may not exactly align with the time that the test is taken. For example, a care home might complete registrations the night before they administer the tests. However, the start time used is consistent enough to provide comparable data on the time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from the time of test for all mechanisms of testing. Satellite tests are predominantly used by care homes who need greater control and flexibility over when test kits are collected. For example, tests may be conducted over multiple days with a collection scheduled a few days later. Because of this, a lower proportion of test results will be available within 24 hours of the test being taken.</p>

<p>After someone takes a test, their test is transported to a laboratory for processing. There are normal fluctuations in this operational process which can sometimes cause the time taken to receive a test result to go over 24 hours, but still be turned around the next day. Where appropriate, the number of tests turned around the day after a test was taken are provided.</p>

<h4>Time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of booking</h4>

<p>The time taken to receive a COVID-19 test result from time of booking is measured from the time that a person books an appointment on the website to the time when the person receives a notification of their test result via an email or an SMS. This data is only available for regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units, as test booking and registration processes for home testing and satellite test centres are currently undertaken on different systems.</p>

<h4>Pillar 2 distance to take an in-person test</h4>

<p>From 24 September 2020, the distance to take an in-person test has been included for pillar 2 tests. For each person who successfully registered for a test (including those who registered for a test but did not turn up to the test site) under pillar 2 at a regional test site, local test site or mobile testing unit, the distance between their location and their associated testing site is measured as the direct distance (that is, in a straight line ‘as the crow flies’).</p>

<p>A person’s home location is calculated as the approximate centre of their postal district (for example, PO15) provided at the time of booking. The centre of the postal district is used instead of the full postcode for data protection reasons and is measured using publicly available <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> census data. These distances are reported as the median and 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles for those who successfully booked a test at regional test sites, local test sites and mobile testing units. Note that data on distance to take a test does not include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<h3>Contact tracing in England</h3>

<p>Once a person has a confirmed positive test result for coronavirus, this person is transferred to NHS Test and Trace and a case is opened for them. NHS Test and Trace makes an initial decision on how to manage the case based on the exposure settings of the individual, in other words, the place in which the person may have exposed others to the virus. There are a few points when this can happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when a case is first reported there is a check against care home postcodes;</li>
  <li>the data provided by people responding online via the secure website is queried to look for certain exposure settings;</li>
  <li>if call handlers identify a certain exposure setting while speaking to the individual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace are managed in different ways depending on their exposure settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as complex cases): <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection teams manage cases linked to outbreaks, examples include someone who works or has recently visited:
    <ul>
      <li>a health or care setting, such as a hospital or care home</li>
      <li>a prison or other secure setting</li>
      <li>a school for people with special needs</li>
      <li>critical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>cases not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as non-complex cases): wider online and other call centre capacity for cases that are not linked to the above exposure settings, plus the use of local teams in certain regions</li>
</ul>

<p>For cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, contacts are often managed at a situation rather than individual level, with advice being issued to the contact institution (for example in a care home or prison).</p>

<p>For those cases not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, the NHS Test and Trace service will get in contact via a text, email alert or phone call. People are asked to share details of other people with whom they have had close, recent contact and places they have visited. They can respond online via a secure website or by telephone with a contact tracer.</p>

<p>On occasion, a person’s case may be handled by the NHS Test and Trace service and later escalated to a local health protection team.</p>

<p>From 29 October 2020, the terminology relating to cases has changed in order to more accurately reflect the contact tracing operations. The cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not necessarily more complex than individual cases and contacts managed by national contact tracers and therefore the terms ‘complex’ and ‘non-complex’ have been removed. Cases and contacts are handled in different ways depending on their exposure setting, with positive cases linked to potential outbreaks in specific settings being handled by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>). These cases and contacts are therefore referred to as ‘cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’ from 29 October 2020. Cases and contacts managed nationally either online or by call centres are referred to as ‘cases and contacts not managed by local health protection teams’. This change is to the terminology used to describe the 2 methods of handling cases and contacts and does not impact on the methodology used to breakdown the data in this way.</p>

<p>From 14 December 2020, operational changes have been introduced to improve how the outcomes of contact tracing calls are recorded. These changes ensure more consistency in how handlers record the call outcome and associated improvements in workflows. These changes are reflected in the data published from 24 December 2020.</p>

<h4>Positive cases transferred to NHS Test and Trace</h4>

<p>The number of positive cases transferred to the contact-tracing system may not always align with the number of people testing positive for COVID-19. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delays between a sample being taken, tested and reported, and being passed from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> to the contact-tracing system mean that weekly totals transferred to NHS Test and Trace may include people who were tested in the previous week</li>
  <li>there is not a rigorous process for deduplication of the data being passed into the contact-tracing system each day, as the emphasis is on transferring these cases quickly. Some people may have their case transferred to the contact-tracing system more than once, which means there may be more people transferred to contact tracing than test positive for coronavirus within a given period</li>
</ul>

<p>When a case is transferred to NHS Test and Trace contact tracers will attempt to contact the individual which results in one the following 3 outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reached and provided information about recent close contacts – contact tracers or local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> successfully reached the individual and asked them to provide details for recent close contacts</li>
  <li>no communication details provided – people who had no communication details provided are those who were transferred to NHS Test and Trace but did not have any associated contact details (for example phone number or email address)</li>
  <li>not reached – the number of people who were not reached includes those people who the service has been unable to reach because there has been no response to text, email and call reminders. It also includes people who were reached but declined to give details of close contacts. There may also be a small number of people who have not been reached but where contact tracers are still in the process of trying to make contact</li>
</ul>

<p>Those people who have been reached and provided information about recent close contacts has been split to show the people whose cases were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and people whose cases were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. If NHS Test and Trace is not able to reach a person or if no communication details are available, it is not always possible to know if the case would have been managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> or not. Therefore, these breakdowns are not available.</p>

<h4>Number of people who were reached by upper-tier local authority</h4>

<p>The number of positive cases transferred to the contact-tracing system and the number who were reached and provided information about recent close contacts is also provided for each upper-tier local authority (<abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>) area. Cases are matched to a <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> via their postcode so, in general, this information refers to people who are living in that <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>. Data for City of London and Hackney, and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have been combined due to their smaller population size. Numbers below 3 are suppressed to ensure that no one is identifiable from the data</p>

<p>While it is possible to subtract the cumulative data by <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> for consecutive weeks to give the weekly numbers, this does not account for the revisions that are made to the data each week. As such, this will sometimes result in more people seeming to be reached than were transferred. For this reason, it is not advisable to use the data in this way.</p>

<h4>Number of people providing details of one or more recent close contacts</h4>

<p>Not everyone who was reached and asked to provide details of recent close contacts will have had any recent close contacts. The number who were not able to give any recent close contacts therefore refers to people who were successfully reached by NHS Test and Trace, but either had no recent close contacts or could not provide details of close recent contacts to pass on for further contact tracing (for example, recent close contact with strangers on the bus).</p>

<h4>Number of people who were reached by the method used to reach them</h4>

<p>When a case that is not managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> is first transferred to contact tracing, they are sent a link to the NHS Test and Trace website where they are invited to record the details of their close contacts online. This is the default method of communication for cases that are not managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Before 13 October 2020, cases in areas with locally supported contact tracing did not have the option to self-completion online. However, this was reinstated from this point. Cases are given 8 hours to complete online and if they fail to do so they are then contacted by phone by a contact tracer. This breakdown is only available for cases that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are usually managed at a situation rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The total number of cases reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not always match the sum of those reached by phone and web due to a small number of cases for whom the method by which they were reached is not recorded or ambiguous.</p>

<p>From 29 January, there has been a minor change in the method used to reach cases from areas where there are known variants of concern. These cases are transferred to both the self-completion online route and the phone route at the same time (rather than allowing them 8 hours to complete online before contacting them by phone). All these cases have been recorded as completed by phone as it is not currently possible in the data to distinguish which route was used.</p>

<p>This previously affected only a small number of cases, however from 1 March this method has been rolled out for cases from all areas and some contacts. Consequently, from 11 March, this breakdown has been removed from the NHS Test and Trace weekly publication while we explore the feasibility of using a different method to distinguish the route used.</p>

<h4>Time taken for people transferred to contact tracing to identify recent close contacts</h4>

<p>This is the time taken from a case being set up and a person being transferred to contact tracing to the time the person was reached and asked to provide information about recent close contacts. This data is only collected for people who were reached. It excludes cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as part of outbreak investigations.</p>

<h4>Close contacts identified by NHS Test and Trace, England</h4>

<p>Once a person has tested positive, they are contacted and asked to identify recent close contacts. When asked for recent close contacts, close contact means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having face-to-face contact with someone (less than 1 metre away)</li>
  <li>spending more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of someone</li>
  <li>travelling in a car or other small vehicle with someone (even on a short journey) or close to them on a plane</li>
</ul>

<p>‘Recent’ refers to anybody that the person has been in close contact with in the 48 hours before they developed symptoms and the time since they developed symptoms.</p>

<p>For cases that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, the way in which recent close contacts are identified has changed since the beginning of NHS Test and Trace. For example, when Test and Trace began, everyone who lived or worked within a setting such as a care home with a person who tested positive for COVID-19 would have been considered a contact. Since then, the guidance has changed and health protection teams now consider factors such as direct contact and the use of PPE, instead of recording all people in each setting.</p>

<p>Contacts managed as part of outbreaks by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> have been deduplicated where possible to only count a person once <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once contacts have been identified, they will be contacted in turn by the NHS Test and Trace service and advised to self-isolate for a period of 14 days.</p>

<p>As with positive cases, contacts are handled in different ways depending on the exposure setting, in other words, where the contact was likely to have been exposed to the virus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as complex): <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection teams manage cases linked to outbreaks, examples include someone who works or has recently visited:
    <ul>
      <li>a health or care setting, such as a hospital or care home</li>
      <li>a prison or other secure setting</li>
      <li>a school for people with special needs</li>
      <li>critical national infrastructure or areas vital for national security</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> (previously known as non-complex): wider online and other call centre capacity for contacts that are not linked to the above exposure settings</li>
</ul>

<p>From 29 October 2020, the terminology relating to contacts has changed in order to more accurately reflect the contact tracing operations. The cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not necessarily more complex than individual cases and contacts managed by national contact tracers and therefore the terms ‘complex’ and ‘non-complex’ have been removed. Cases and contacts are handled in different ways depending on their exposure setting, with positive cases linked to potential outbreaks in specific settings being handled by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> local health protection teams (<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>). These cases and contacts are therefore referred to as ‘cases and contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>’ from 29 October 2020. Cases and contacts managed nationally either online or by call centres are referred to as ‘cases and contacts not managed by local health protection teams’. This change is to the terminology used to describe the two methods of handling cases and contacts and does not impact on the methodology used to breakdown the data in this way.</p>

<p>A small number of contacts are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> initially and are later escalated to a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>Generally, contacts who are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not be recorded individually, as the local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> manage these contacts at a situation rather than individual level. However, since the launch of the Test and Trace Support Payment scheme, it is sometimes necessary for contacts that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> to be recorded independently of the exposure setting. This may result in some duplication of contacts, although this is only thought to affect a small number of individuals.</p>

<h4>Number of recent close contacts identified</h4>

<p>When a contact is identified, contact tracers will attempt to contact the individual which results in one the following 3 outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reached and advised to self-isolate: for contacts not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, contact tracers successfully reached the individual and advised them to self-isolate. For those managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, advice is provided to the institution which is passed on to the individuals in the specific setting.</li>
  <li>communication details not provided: people who were identified as recent close contacts but did not have any associated contact details (for example phone number or email address)</li>
  <li>not reached: the number of people who were not reached includes those people who the service has been unable to reach because there has been no response to text, email and call reminders. There may also be a small number of people who have not been reached but where contact tracers are still in the process of trying to make contact</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome will partly depend on whether the person is managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> or not and the data has been split to give the outcomes for these contacts separately. For contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, it is not possible to be identified as a close contact and not have communication details provided because these are managed at a situation, rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The number of contacts identified is not deduplicated because a single person may be reported as a contact on multiple occasions if they have come into close contact with more than one positive case. They would therefore be contact traced multiple times to ensure the correct period of self-isolation is given. For this reason, the number of contacts identified, and the number of contacts reached does not represent the number of unique individuals.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, there is a change in how household contacts under 18 are reached. These changes mean that under-18s in a household will not each have to be contact-traced individually, as long as the parent or guardian in the household confirms they have completed their legal duty to inform their child to self-isolate. If no parental permission is provided, NHS Test and Trace will follow the standard contact-tracing routes. These changes have been implemented acting on feedback the service has received from families and should see a reduction in the number of calls received by households with children. From 27 November 2020, changes have been extended to cover adults in the same household. They will have the option to be traced through a single phone call, further reducing the number of calls made to the same household. This change will also optimise the productivity of the tracing service by minimising the number of calls made.</p>

<p>If a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is asked to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. If a case provides information for household contacts over 18, they are given the option to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate so these contacts are not contacted individually by contact tracers. (If the case does not want to take responsibility for over 18s in their household, they will be contacted by contact tracers as usual.) The case provides some basic information for the household contacts and each record is reported as complete. This change is expected to increase the proportion of household contacts reached and consequently the total number of contacts reached. It is also expected to increase the proportion of contacts reached within 24 hours.</p>

<p>From 27 August 2020, information about the median number of contacts per case has been included. Because of the nature of outbreaks, there can be a higher number of contacts associated to cases that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> in comparison to contacts identified through the contact-tracing system. These contacts are often managed at a situation level (for example in a care home or prison) rather than individually, with advice being issued to the contact institution. When local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> record whether contact tracing has been completed, they therefore do this for the whole situation (meaning all associated contacts will be counted as having been reached and told to self-isolate).</p>

<p>This data does not include information about compliance and there may be some people who were identified as recent close contacts and told to self-isolate but have not agreed to do so.</p>

<h4>Number of contacts who were reached by upper-tier local authority</h4>

<p>The number of close contacts identified that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and the number who were reached and told to self-isolate is also provided for each upper-tier local authority (<abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>) area. Contacts are matched to a <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> via their postcode so, in general, this information refers to people who are living in that <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr>. On some occasions, postcode data is not available for contacts, in which case the postcode of the case from which the contact originated is used. Data for City of London and Hackney, and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have been combined due to their smaller population size. Numbers below 3 are suppressed to ensure that no one is identifiable from the data.</p>

<p>While it is possible to subtract the cumulative data by <abbr title="upper-tier local authority">UTLA</abbr> for consecutive weeks to give the weekly numbers, this does not account for the revisions that are made to the data each week. As such, this will sometimes result in more people seeming to be reached than were transferred. For this reason, it is not advisable to use the data in this way.</p>

<h4>Number of household and non-household contacts</h4>

<p>The number of household contacts has been included for cases and contacts that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>. This shows the number of recent close contacts who live in the same household as the person who has tested positive for coronavirus and the number who were reached and told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, there is a change in how household contacts under 18 are reached. If a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. The case provides some basic information for the household contacts and each record is reported as complete.</p>

<p>From 27 November 2020, changes have been extended to cover household contacts over 18 so they have the option to be traced through a single phone call, further reducing the number of calls made to the same household.</p>

<p>Before these changes, it is likely that cases would advise their household contacts to self-isolate in advance of these contacts being directly contacted by contact tracers. Therefore, even where household contacts are recorded as not reached and advised to self-isolate, they may already be aware of their exposure and isolating appropriately. This may have been a contributing factor to a lower proportion of household contacts being reached in comparison to non-household contacts.</p>

<h4>Number of contacts who were reached by the method used to reach them</h4>

<p>This is a breakdown of contacts who were reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> by whether they were reached by phone, online or via their household case. From 18 November 2020, if a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contact traced individually, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. From 27 November 2020, this change applies to some household contacts over 18. The method by which contacts were reached is therefore broken down into household and non-household contacts as only household contacts have the option to complete via their case.</p>

<p>When a contact is first identified, providing they are not a household contact or managed by a local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, they are sent a link to the NHS Test and Trace website where they are provided with self-isolation advice and are asked to confirm that they will follow this advice. Contacts are given 8 hours to complete online and if they fail to do so they are then contacted by phone by a contact tracer. This breakdown is only available for contacts that are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> as contacts that are managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are usually managed at a situation rather than individual level.</p>

<p>The total number of contacts reached and not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will not always match the sum of those reached by the phone, online and via their household case due to a small number of contacts for whom the method by which they were reached is not recorded or ambiguous.</p>

<p>From 29 January, there has been a minor change in the method used to reach cases from areas where there are known variants of concern. These cases are transferred to both the self-completion online route and the phone route at the same time (rather than allowing them 8 hours to complete online before contacting them by phone). All these cases have been recorded as completed by phone as it is not currently possible in the data to distinguish which route was used.</p>

<p>This previously affected only a small number of cases, however from 1 March this method has been rolled out for cases from all areas and some contacts. Consequently, from 11 March, this breakdown has been removed from the NHS Test and Trace weekly publication while we explore the feasibility of using a different method to distinguish the route used.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached</h4>

<p>This is the time taken from a recent close contact being identified by a person to the contact being reached and advised to self-isolate. It only includes those recent close contacts who were reached and told to self-isolate and excludes contacts managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>.</p>

<p>From 18 November 2020, if a case provides information for household contacts under 18, they are no longer contacted individually by contact tracers, but instead the case is told to inform these individuals that they need to self-isolate. These contacts are included in the timing information for contact tracing and are reached within 24 hours from being identified. From 27 November 2020, this change also applies to some household contacts over 18.</p>

<p>From 11 February 2021, additional times are also provided to give a sense of the end-to-end journey time through the test and trace system. These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the time taken for close contacts to be reached from the time when the positive case that reported them was transferred to the contact tracing system</li>
  <li>the time taken for close contacts to be reached from the time when the positive case that reported them took the test that subsequently returned a positive result</li>
  <li>the median time taken for close contacts to be reached from the date that a symptomatic person who tested positive, and was subsequently contacted by NHS Test and Trace, first observed these symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that these times are not necessarily directly comparable to each other as certain cases or contacts may be included in some breakdowns and not others. More information on each of these time series is provided below.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached from the time the positive case was transferred to contact tracing system</h4>

<p>This information is only available for contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>, although there are a small number of these contacts where they are associated with a case that was managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and for whom this data is not available. This means that the total number of contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will be lower than that reported elsewhere in the publication. However, this affects less than 1% of the contacts that were not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> and were reached.</p>

<h4>Time taken for recent close contacts to be reached from when the case took the test</h4>

<p>This time series is only currently available in the number of days since the test was taken. This is because only information on the day of the test is collected in the contact tracing system. We are currently investigating the possibility of linking the exact time the test was taken from other datasets to the contact tracing system in order to provide the number of contacts that were reached within 72 hours of the case that reported them taking a test.</p>

<p>As with the other time series for close contacts to be reached, contacts that were managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> are not included.</p>

<h4>Median time taken from when the case first observed symptoms to when their close contacts were reached</h4>

<p>When a person who has tested positive is reached by NHS Test and Trace, they are asked if they have been experiencing any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new, continuous cough</li>
  <li>high temperature or fever (higher than 38 degrees Celsius)</li>
  <li>loss or change to your sense of smell or taste</li>
  <li>altered consciousness</li>
  <li>diarrhoea</li>
  <li>extreme tiredness</li>
  <li>headaches</li>
  <li>joint pain</li>
  <li>loss of appetite</li>
  <li>muscle ache</li>
  <li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
  <li>nosebleed</li>
  <li>rash</li>
  <li>runny nose</li>
  <li>seizures</li>
  <li>sneezing</li>
  <li>sore throat</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
  <li>other</li>
  <li>none</li>
</ul>

<p>If a person reports one or more of these symptoms, they are then asked what date they first had these symptoms. This self-reported date is used to calculate the time from the case first observing symptoms to the close contact being reached.</p>

<p>As this data is collected by asking people testing positive to recall a date, it is not possible to obtain accurate information on the exact time symptoms were first observed. All time measures more exact than full days are derived by taking 12 noon as the time of symptom onset. This assumes that the time of symptom onset is distributed evenly throughout the day.</p>

<p>Due to this data being self-declared by people testing positive, potential sources of error are that people may incorrectly recall when they first had symptoms. People who are reached online may also enter an incorrect date when requested to do so, such as their date of birth, a date before March 2020 or a date far in the future. The data is therefore cleaned to remove cases where the date of symptom onset is after the contact was reached.</p>

<p>A median number of days or hours is presented as the average rather than the mean. The median is regarded as a more representative average value when the data contains a small number of very high values. In this case, a small number of people who were recorded in the data as having been contacted by NHS Test and Trace a long time after symptom onset may have had a disproportionate effect on the average time experienced by most people. For this reason, the median is presented as a representative average.</p>

<h2>Tests conducted, England</h2>

<p>This section describes the methodology behind the data published in the ‘Tests conducted’ data tables on the weekly collection page and the statistical bulletin on rapid asymptomatic testing.</p>

<h3>Data sources</h3>

<p>This data is management information for testing and covers England only.</p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>

<p>For <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests, this data contains tests taken through the pillar 2 testing routes only (swab testing the wider population).</p>

<p>For <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, this data includes those reported through the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and doesn’t include <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted where the tests were not registered via this route. The following use cases for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are not reporting results digitally into Test and Trace systems, and therefore are excluded from this report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>testing for the majority of NHS secondary care staff</li>
  <li>testing for some staff in private sector industries</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, test results should be reported directly into Public Health England.</p>

<p>In future, all <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests will be reported via the existing National Testing Programme digital infrastructure and will be included.</p>

<p>Due to the change in guidance issued on 23 December 2020 to increase testing in care home staff, the requirement for care home staff to register negative <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results was suspended between 31 December 2020 and 15 January 2021 inclusive.</p>

<p>As a result, a proportion of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted on care home staff will not be included for these dates.</p>

<p>An <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test produces a result on the device almost immediately, without it being automatically recorded, therefore some results might not be captured. For settings where self-reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing procedures are in place, it is likely that the number of tests conducted are underreported. It is however their statutory duty to do so, and easier reporting tools are being rolled out to support these individuals to report their tests as quickly and efficiently as possible. It is possible that tests with a negative result are more likely to be affected, therefore it is not advisable to calculate a positivity rate with the data.</p>

<h3>Timings and revisions</h3>

<p>A snapshot of this data is taken for publication several days after the end of the reporting period to give time for tests reported at the end of the 7-day period to be captured. Figures given in previous releases are routinely revised as some tests may continue to be reported after this period.</p>

<p>Each weekly publication provides daily counts of tests conducted from 28 May 2020 however lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests were only made available from 21 October 2020. From 1 October 2020, the number of pillar 2 swab tests conducted by lower-tier local authority (<abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr>) was made available and from 10 December 2020, weekly breakdowns for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests have been added. This includes whether the test was positive, negative or void and lower-tier local authority breakdowns.</p>

<h3>Types of coronavirus testing</h3>

<h4>Lab-based virus tests</h4>

<p>These test for the presence of COVID-19 using a swab which is processed in a lab via <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>. They are carried out within pillar 1, pillar 2 and pillar 4.</p>

<p>In order to increase the capacity of the testing system to produce results, pooling of lab-based virus tests is being piloted within universities and adult social care from October 2020. Multiple swabs from individuals in the same household are grouped at point of swabbing and processed in the lab as one vial, a test result is then issued for all individuals that formed part of the pool. A negative result indicates that all individuals tested negative. A positive result indicates at least one individual is positive and all individuals are subsequently retested individually. Pooled tests are not currently included in the pillar 2 test turnaround time data.</p>

<h4>Antibody tests</h4>

<p>Antibody serology tests test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies. These include pillar 3 tests and antibody tests undertaken within pillar 4.</p>

<h4>Lateral flow device tests</h4>

<p>Lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) tests test for the presence of COVID-19 and are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. LFDs were only made available from 21 October 2020 and were initially available in limited capacity except for areas where mass testing pilots were conducted. The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted is expected to increase over time.</p>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests are reported for England only and daily data for <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests has been made available from 21 October 2020 on the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a>.</p>

<h4>Number of tests conducted</h4>

<p>The ‘number of tests conducted’ counts all tests that have remained within the control of the programme (including <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> swab tests and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests) and those that have been sent out and subsequently returned to be processed in a lab (such as satellite and home test kits). They are counted at the time they are processed. For a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test this is when the test is processed in a lab, for an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test this when the test was taken.</p>

<p>The number of tests conducted is reported by the 3 possible results of taking a test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>positive</li>
  <li>negative</li>
  <li>unknown or void</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons for unknown or void tests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the testing within the laboratory was unable to give an exact answer as the test gave an equivocal result (it was not clearly negative or positive)</li>
  <li>there was an issue with the sample when it is delivered to the laboratory making it impossible to return a result, such as the tube was damaged or leaked, the test could not be scanned, the instructions were not followed or the swab was not put in the tube. Due to the issue with the sample, some of these tests may not have been processed by the lab at all</li>
</ul>

<p>These figures are provisional, based on management information for testing. These figures will not align with those published on the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">coronavirus in the UK dashboard</a> as they are derived from a different data source with different associated methodology. The reasons for the differences are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cut of the data was taken at different points in time for each source</li>
  <li>this report uses the date a test was processed in the laboratory whereas the dashboard reports on the date reported by laboratories</li>
  <li>the <abbr title="lower-tier local authority">LTLA</abbr> is determined using the postcode of the person tested, the dashboard data is only available at a national level and this is determined by each of the individual devolved administrations</li>
  <li>daily data on the dashboard is not routinely revised figures whereas figures in this report are updated for previous dates when each data cut is taken</li>
</ul>

<h3>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in education settings</h3>

<h4>Primary schools, schools-based nurseries and maintained nursery schools</h4>

<p>Since 18 January 2021, on-site staff in primary schools, school-based nurseries, and state-maintained nurseries have been able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> twice weekly at home. Primary and nursery staff self-report their test result, therefore if an individual receives a positive result, they are then required to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. Primary school students are not currently being tested. This is because serious COVID-related illness is extremely rare in children and there is lower case rates and transmissions in younger children in comparison to secondary school children. Primary school aged children are likely to find repeated testing unpleasant and parents may find it challenging to repeatedly swab young children.</p>

<h4>Secondary schools and colleges</h4>

<p><abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing within secondary schools and colleges was implemented for on-site staff from 4 January 2021. Staff were expected to take a test once a week initially. However the guidance was updated at the start of the national lockdown to twice-weekly testing for those staff attending schools and colleges. Initially, secondary school staff testing was assisted via the use of an asymptomatic test site, however from 25 February they were encouraged to use home test kits. From the 8 March testing was expanded to all secondary school staff and students. On their return to school, students are required to take 3 tests (spaced 3 to 5 days apart) at their onsite asymptomatic test centre. Following this, they then begin twice weekly home testing. For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mass-testing-for-secondary-pupils-as-all-schools-and-colleges-fully-reopenfrom8-march" class="govuk-link">mass testing for secondary pupils</a>.</p>

<h4>Households and bubbles of school students and staff</h4>

<p>From 1 March 2021 households, childcare and support bubbles of primary and secondary school students and staff are able to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test twice a week. Tests taken by these individuals are reported within the figures for the school they are associated with. There are numerous ways these groups of individuals can receive a test. For more information see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rapid-lateral-flow-testing-for-households-and-bubbles-of-school-pupils-and-staff" class="govuk-link">rapid lateral flow testing for households and bubbles of school pupils and staff</a>.</p>

<h4>Higher education</h4>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing was implemented from 27 November 2020 in higher education providers to support a strategy to enable students to safely travel home for the winter break. Tests taken before this were part of testing pilots. Testing has continued into the spring term with <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests made available to both on-site staff and students via an asymptomatic testing site. Students currently eligible to return to their provider are expected to be tested twice on their return and twice weekly thereafter. Staff who are required to be physically present at work are also expected to be tested twice weekly. For more information on testing in higher education see the guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses">students returning to and starting higher education in spring term 2021</a>.</p>

<h4>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests by phase of education and individual role</h4>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests conducted in the education sector are reported with a breakdown per phase of education and role (staff, student, household bubble and support bubble). <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result breakdowns are reported by the date the test result was communicated.</p>

<p>Primary school, schools-based nurseries and maintained nursery school data is collected from the self-reporting process. Secondary school and collage data is identified from asymptomatic test sites (<abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>) linked to schools and from 25 February individuals self-reporting tests. Data for higher education establishments is identified from tests taken at their asymptomatic test sites. Prior to 25 February phase of education is assigned by the testing journey as all primary school staff were self-testing and all secondary schools were tested via the <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>. From 25 February this has been improved and tests are assigned to a phase of education by linking information the individuals captured by the individuals when they self-report or from the <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr> to data held for each education institution.</p>

<p>For tests taken prior to 5 March, the individual role (staff or student) is determined using age as a proxy. An individual aged 20 or over is categorised as a staff member and under 20 a student. This method is not appropriate for colleges and higher education and therefore is not included. From 5 March, the self-test registration process will soon gathers this information and determines on whether someone is a staff member, student, part of a household, childcare or support bubble. The figures for tests taken by school household bubbles and school support bubbles are therefore only available from 5 March. Students and staff can also get tested at an <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>, tests taken via this route continue to use age as proxy for staff and students.</p>

<p>The number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests reported by phase of education will not be directly comparable to the number of tests conducted in England. There are a number of reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source for the number of LFDs by phase of education is different.</li>
  <li>the number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests by phase of education test result uses different metrics to segregate data for England from the UK</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data quality for testing in education</h4>

<p>Testing in primary schools, schools-based nurseries, maintained nursery schools, secondary schools and colleges is carried out using self-report <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests, hence the level of data quality and accuracy is entirely reliant on subjects reporting the result of the <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test and completing the testing journey.</p>

<p>For tests taken after 25 February, reference data from the Department of Education is used to determine the phase of education. For some tests where there is a lack of information captured, the test cannot be linked to a type of school. For the purposes of this report, these tests are reported separately as unidentified phase of education. In addition, a small number of secondary school tests prior to the 31 December 2020 have been excluded due to pilots not reporting digitally.</p>

<p>Age is used as a proxy for individual role for any tests prior to 5 March or where a test was taken at an <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr>. Note, only students and staff are able to test at an <abbr title="asymptomatic test site">ATS</abbr> and not household or support bubbles.</p>

<p>Higher education reference data is used to determine which tests were taken in higher education providers. Given the decentralised site creation, there is no immediate visibility of new sites but these are incorporated into the data over time.</p>

<p>Tests not registered refers to tests which have been taken. However the individual has not digitally registered their test. This means these tests cannot be linked back to individuals in the system and a limited amount of information is captured. These tests are reported separately in the data tables and the figures will be revised if the tests are subsequently registered.</p>

<h2>Number of <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests conducted in care home settings</h2>
<p>The number of tests conducted in care homes includes staff, residents and visitors tested via kits directly sent to the care home. It will not include care home staff, residents or visitors who are tested via a different route. The figures relate to adult care homes and children’s care homes are excluded (for example at a regional or local test site, mobile testing unit or asymptomatic testing site).</p>

<h3>Staff</h3>

<p>Routine asymptomatic testing of care home staff began on 7 June 2020 with weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for staff. Enhanced testing began from 23 December 2020 with twice weekly rapid lateral flow tests for staff and rapid response testing in the event of a positive test result for 7 days.</p>

<p>From 16 February 2021, the rapid response testing was extended to cover daily rapid lateral flow testing for all staff until 5 days without a positive test result occur. Whole home <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing is undertaken in the event of an outbreak, first on day 1 and then again between day 4-7 of the outbreak.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> can also use rapid lateral flow tests alongside PCRs for all staff at their discretion.</p>

<h3>Residents</h3>

<p>Routine testing of care home residents began on 7 June 2020 with monthly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests for residents.</p>

<p>Whole home testing in the event of an outbreak was put in place from 22nd January 2021, with <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing undertaken first on day 1 and then again between day 4 to 7 of the outbreak. From the 16 February <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> can also use rapid lateral flow tests alongside PCRs for all residents at their discretion.</p>

<h3>Care home visitors</h3>

<p>Rapid lateral flow tests were made available to some care homes for visitors to test on arrival for a visit from 2 December 2020. From 14 December 2020 this was rolled out to all care homes and all visitors were required to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on arrival. Indoor visiting was suspended on 6 January 2021 in line with national lockdown restrictions. Throughout the period of national restrictions, visits were limited to outdoors, in visiting pods or with a substantial screen; as well as those in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<p>From 8 March 2021 care home residents can nominate a single named visitor for indoor visits who will be required to take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on every visit. Residents with the highest care and support needs can also have regular visits from an ‘essential care giver’ who will access the same testing arrangements as members of staff, that is a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and (at least) twice weekly <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>.</p>

<h3>Care home visiting professionals <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors</h3>

<p>From 14 December 2020 <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors should take a weekly <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test. From 22 March 2021 they should also conduct a lateral flow test on the day of their inspection.</p>

<h3>All other professionals</h3>

<p>From 14 December 2020 all other professionals not already tested through regular NHS staff testing or <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors should be tested using a lateral flow test at the care home door immediately prior to a visit.</p>

<h2>How the data in this bulletin can be used</h2>

<p>This data can be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determine the effectiveness of NHS Test and Trace in contacting people with coronavirus and their close contacts</li>
  <li>monitor the number of outbreaks (cases managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>) occurring in England and comparing this to cases are not managed by local <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>
</li>
  <li>approximate the size of the population who should be self-isolating each week</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>calculate the prevalence of COVID-19 in the wider population</li>
  <li>determine compliance of the population with coronavirus guidance</li>
  <li>compare tracing services across nations due to differences in definitions and methodologies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on interpreting weekly data</h3>

<p>Each weekly update provides a snapshot of the cases and contacts completed within the 7-day period. The most recently reported week should be treated with some caution, as this data may be revised in the time series on the next release.</p>

<p>The statistics will be updated as more data becomes available and reportable. These are experimental statistics that are in the testing phase and not yet fully developed.</p>

<h3>Notes on interpreting against other statistics</h3>

<p>Historic figures for testing in the UK are available in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> daily time series data</a>. However, this data will no longer be updated after 20 August 2020. Statistics on deaths, tests and cases are published daily in the <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/?_ga=2.265749707.532009857.1592816143-2145795025.1590065527" class="govuk-link" rel="external"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Figures in the <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> dashboard will be consistent with those published in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-test-and-trace-statistics-england-weekly-reports?">NHS Test and Trace weekly bulletins</a>. However, figures may not always exactly align due to the timing of data cuts. In addition, the dashboard reports positive cases deduplicated across the whole of Test and Trace. The weekly NHS Test and Trace reports positive cases deduplicated across each weekly period. As a different methodology is used, these figures will not align.</p>

<p>Tests processed are reported in this publication and tests conducted are reported on the dashboard. These will not align as tests processed counts all tests processed in a lab whereas tests conducted includes all tests (swab, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and antibody tests), some of which are not processed in a lab.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Given the importance of this service and the commitment of NHS Test and Trace to be open and transparent with the public it serves, these data are being released at the earliest possible opportunity. However, new IT systems and statistical outputs often take some time to bed in. This data should therefore be treated with caution while the system and our understanding of the data develops.</p>

<p>At this early stage, there is a risk of data entry errors or delay, which may require that data are revised and updated in subsequent publications. The process of finding and removing duplicate records may also need refining, which could result in revisions to the data.</p>
