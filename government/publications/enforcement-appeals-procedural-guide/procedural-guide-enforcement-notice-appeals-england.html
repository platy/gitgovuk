<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>1.1.	The content of this document is guidance only with no legal status. However, everyone should follow the general principles, as will Inspectors who may adapt them as necessary for an individual appeal whilst ensuring that no party is prejudiced. It should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals#Enforcement-appeal">planning practice guidance</a> published by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).</p>

<p>1.2. Apart from where it is otherwise stated, this guide also applies to listed building enforcement appeals.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>	Before making an appeal</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>	Responsibilities of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and appellant</h3>

<p>2.1.1. A local planning authority (<abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>) will issue an enforcement notice because it considers that the development in question is a breach of planning control and that it’s expedient to take action.</p>

<p>2.1.2.	A breach of planning control is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the carrying out of development without the required planning permission</li>
  <li>or a failure to comply with any condition or limitation attached to a planning permission.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any contravention of the limitations on, or conditions belonging to, permitted development rights, under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/596/contents/made" rel="external">Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015</a> also constitutes a breach of planning control.</p>

<p>2.1.3.	The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> have discretion to decide whether to issue an enforcement notice if they consider that a breach of planning control has taken place and that it is expedient to take action. Please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ensuring-effective-enforcement">Planning Practice Guidance</a> for further information.</p>

<p>2.1.4.	It is important that the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and the people it considers as having breached planning control engage in constructive discussions and where appropriate to consider alternative dispute resolution such as mediation. Agreement can often be found without the need to make an appeal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>	Costs</h3>

<p>2.2.1.	All parties are expected to meet their own appeal expenses.</p>

<p>2.2.2. All parties have a responsibility to behave reasonably. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> should consider carefully before taking enforcement action and only issue an enforcement notice if it has a sufficiently strong case. It should make its reasons for issuing the notice clear.</p>

<p>2.2.3.	Someone considering making an appeal (‘the appellant’) should consider carefully the reasons for appealing the enforcement notice and have a clear case. This means being able to respond to the reasoning the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> have given on the enforcement notice.</p>

<p>2.2.4.	If a party does not behave reasonably during the appeal process, they leave themselves open to costs being awarded against them. This is where the party must pay for the expenses other parties have incurred because of the unreasonable behaviour. Costs may be awarded in response to an application for costs by one of the parties. Also, costs may be awarded at the initiative of the Inspector.</p>

<p>2.2.5.	Further guidance on costs awards can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/appeals#the-award-of-costs--general">planning practice guidance</a>. The appellant should only make an appeal after they have read the guidance on costs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>	Eligibility for making an appeal</h3>

<p>2.3.1.	To make an appeal against an enforcement notice, you must either have an <strong>interest</strong> in or be a <strong>relevant occupier</strong> of the land the enforcement notice relates to.</p>

<p>2.3.2.	‘Interest’ means either a legal or equitable interest in the land when the appeal is made (irrespective of your status when the enforcement notice was served). This includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Owners</li>
  <li>Lessees</li>
  <li>Some tenants</li>
  <li>Official receivers</li>
  <li>Mortgagees or other lenders</li>
</ul>

<p>2.3.3.	A ‘relevant occupier’ is someone who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on the date on which the enforcement notice is issued occupies the land through the consent of the owner whether oral, written or implied</li>
  <li>and continues to occupy the land when the appeal is made</li>
</ul>

<p>2.3.4.	A person who does not have an interest in the land or is not a relevant occupier does not have a right of appeal – even if the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> serves a copy of the enforcement notice on them. Similarly, a person that has not been served with a copy of the notice may be eligible to make an appeal.</p>

<p>2.3.5.	A limited company or unincorporated body can have a legal interest in the land or be a relevant occupier. If this is the case the appeal must be made in the name of the company. A director or shareholder, or in the case of an unincorporated body their authorised representative, does not have the right of appeal on the company’s behalf. Although they can act as agent to the appellant company.</p>

<p>2.3.6.	Sometimes, more than one person with an interest in the land may want to respond to the enforcement notice differently. For example, the owner of the land may want the enforcement notice to be upheld, while the occupier of the land may want to keep the development. In these circumstances, it is up to each person to decide how to respond to the notice.</p>

<p>2.3.7.	If the owner of the land does not appeal against an enforcement notice but someone else does, the owner will be an ‘interested person’ in the appeal – see section 7.  This means they will not receive a copy of all the representations made by the appellant, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and other interested people (though they would be able to see such representations at the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>’s offices or the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> may publish them online).</p>

<p>2.3.8.	But the owner can request to be considered an ‘interested owner’. This status is given at our discretion. It means that we will give them similar treatment to an appellant. The owner will be able to attend any hearing or local inquiry or be present when the Inspector visits the site. They will also be able to see and comment on any written representations made by the appellant, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, and any other interested people, during the progress of the appeal. It is important that the owner requests the status of ‘interested owner’ at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>	Deadline for making an appeal</h3>

<p>2.4.1.	Written notice of an appeal against an enforcement notice <strong>must</strong> be received by us <strong>before</strong> the effective date of the notice. The effective date will be on the notice. We cannot accept any appeals received after this date.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>	How to make an appeal</h2>

<p>3.1.	Wherever possible the appellant should make their appeal(s) online through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">Appeals Casework Portal</a>.</p>

<p>3.2.	Please see our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/appealing-to-the-planning-inspectorate-communicating-electronically-with-us">system requirements and submitting documents</a>.</p>

<p>3.3. If someone considering making an appeal does not have access to the internet, they should contact us (see section 9.5), and we will send them the relevant appeal form.</p>

<p>3.4.	If the appellant cannot appeal online and does not have an appeal form and cannot get one to reach us before the deadline, they may make an appeal by sending us a letter or an email saying that they are appealing against the enforcement notice. The appellant must make it clear that the letter or email is a notification of appeal and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the appellant’s name and address</li>
  <li>the name of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>the address of the site/building</li>
  <li>the effective date of the enforcement notice</li>
</ul>

<p>We must receive this before the effective date on the enforcement notice. This should immediately be followed by the completed appeal forms.</p>

<p>3.5.	Appellants must submit one appeal for each enforcement notice they want to appeal against.</p>

<p>3.6.	Appellants must send a copy of the appeal form and supporting documents to us and to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> The appeal</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1. </span> Further guidance on how to complete the appeal form</h3>

<p>4.1.1. Appellants should use the following guides to help them complete the appeal form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-notice-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Enforcement notice appeals: how to complete your appeal form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/listed-building-enforcement-notice-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Listed building enforcement notice appeals: how to complete your appeal form</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>	Grounds of appeal</h3>

<p>4.2.1.	If appealing against an enforcement notice, appellants must make their appeal on one or more of the 7 grounds of appeal outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/174" rel="external">section 174(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Ground (a)</strong> – “that, in respect of any breach of planning control which may be constituted by the matters stated in the notice, planning permission ought to be granted or, as the case may be, the condition or limitation concerned ought to be discharged”</li>
</ul>

<p>If you appeal on ground (a), you are deemed to have made an application for planning permission. This is known as a ‘deemed planning application’ (<abbr title="Deemed Planning Application">DPA</abbr>).</p>

<p>If pleading ground (a), appellants must pay a fee either at the time of making the appeal or within a time limit set by us. The amount payable can be found on the enforcement notice. Failure to pay the fee means the ground (a) appeal and <abbr title="Deemed Planning Application">DPA</abbr> will lapse and cannot be restarted.</p>

<p>If the enforcement notice was issued:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at a time after the making of a related planning application for planning permission</li>
  <li>and before the time limit for the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to determine the application</li>
</ul>

<p>it is not possible to make an appeal on ground (a).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (b)</strong> – “that those matters have not occurred”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (c)</strong> – “that those matters (if they occurred) do not constitute a breach of planning control”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (d)</strong> – “that, at the date when the notice was issued, no enforcement action could be taken in respect of any breach of planning control which may be constituted by those matters”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are time limits for the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to issue an enforcement notice. The time limits vary according to the type of development:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/171B" rel="external">171B(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)</a> gives a time limit of 4 years for notices alleging operational development such as building, mining or engineering works beginning with the date on which the operations were substantially completed</li>
  <li>section 171B(2) gives a 4 year limit for change of use from a building/part of a building to a single dwellinghouse beginning with the date of the breach - this time limit applies either where the change to use as a single dwellinghouse involves development without planning permission, or where it involves a failure to comply with a condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted</li>
  <li>section 171B(3) states that any other breach of planning control is subject to a limit of 10 years from the date of the breach - this applies to changes of use and to breaches of any conditions attached to previous planning permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>For immunity purposes involving a material change in the use of a building or land, the evidence needs to show when that use was instituted and that it has subsisted, without significant interruption, for a continuous 4- or 10-year period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (e)</strong> – “that copies of the enforcement notice were not served as required by section 172”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (f)</strong> – “that the steps required by the notice to be taken, or the activities required by the notice to cease, exceed what is necessary to remedy any breach of planning control which may be constituted by those matters or, as the case may be, to remedy any injury to amenity which has been caused by any such breach”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (g)</strong> – “that any period specified in the notice in accordance with <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/173" rel="external">section 173(9)</a> falls short of what should reasonably be allowed”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>4.2.2.	If appealing against a listed building enforcement notice, appellants must make their appeal on one or more of the 11 grounds of appeal outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/9/section/39" rel="external">section 39 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ground (a)</strong> - that the building is not of special architectural or historic interest</p>

</ul>

<p>4.2.4.	Facts must be provided so that we can make an informed decision on what procedure the appeal should follow and so that all participants in the appeal are aware of the issues and arguments from the start so that they are able to make comments by the week 6 deadline (See section 8).</p>

<p>4.2.5.	The Inspector may disregard any grounds of appeal that are not supported by facts.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3 </span>	Procedure preference</h3>

<p>4.3.1.	With reference to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a>, appellants must state on the appeal form which procedure they think is most appropriate for the appeal and the reasons for their preference. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must do the same in the questionnaire.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>	After the appeal is submitted</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> Validation</h3>

<p>5.1.1	Once an appeal has been submitted, we will check whether it is valid. If the appeal is valid, we will confirm to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and the appellant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the procedure the appeal will follow</li>
  <li>the appeal start date</li>
  <li>the timetable for the appeal</li>
  <li>the address to which all correspondence should be sent</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.2. </span> Procedure determination</h2>

<p>5.2.1. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/319A" rel="external">Section 319A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a> gives us the duty to determine the procedure. See section 8 for an explanation of the procedures.</p>

<p>5.2.2.	In making our decision, we will consider the views of the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a> and expert involvement (where relevant).</p>

<p>5.2.3.	Where our choice differs from that of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and appellant, we will explain the reasons for our choice.</p>

<p>5.2.4.	The appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> can ask for the choice to be reviewed by a senior officer.</p>

<p>5.2.5.	We keep our choice of procedure under review throughout the appeal. Subject to notification and procedural requirements, we may change the procedure. We may also, either at the start or at any point throughout the appeal, combine procedures.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>	Combining procedures</h3>

<p>5.3.1.	The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/16/contents/enacted" rel="external">Business and Planning Act 2020</a> allows us to ‘combine’ procedures. For example, if we decide that an appeal should follow the inquiry procedure, we may choose, based on the criteria, to deal with certain issues by written representations.</p>

<p>5.3.2.	Appeals proceeding by written representations will not normally be combined with other procedures</p>

<p>5.3.3.	It is for us to decide whether combining procedures is appropriate and how it would work (for example, which procedures are combined, what the timetable would be and so on). If we are considering combining procedures, we will invite the parties to comment before any final decision is taken.</p>

<p>5.3.4.	We keep the procedure choice, including combined procedures, under review. Subject to any notification and procedural requirement, we may change it at any point before the appeal decision is made.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>	How the decision is made</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>	The decision-maker</h3>

<p>6.1.1.	Under section 174 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 an eligible person has a right to make an appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State. Through legislation, for almost all appeals, the authority – “the jurisdiction”- to decide an appeal has been transferred to an Inspector.</p>

<p>6.1.2.	In a very small number of cases, the Secretary of State may ‘recover’ the jurisdiction to decide the appeal. This is usually for very large or contentious appeals. See the criteria in the planning practice guidance used to decide if an appeal should be recovered.</p>

<p>6.1.3.	The appeal may be recovered at any stage before the decision is issued even after a site visit, hearing and inquiry has taken place.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>	If an appeal is recovered</h3>

<p>6.2.1.	If an appeal is recovered, we will write to tell the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> setting out the reasons for this.</p>

<p>6.2.2.	A recovered appeal can proceed by written representations, hearing or inquiry or a combination of procedures and will follow the rules for each procedure.</p>

<p>6.2.3.	The Inspector will write a report which contains their recommendations on whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed. The Secretary of State takes in to account the Inspector’s report when making their decision.</p>

<p>6.2.4.	The Secretary of State’s decision will be published in a letter by the Department of Levelling Up Housing and Communities. The letter will be available to view on either the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities"> Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities area of the GOV.UK website</a> or online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>	What the Inspector takes into account</h3>

<p>6.3.1.	In making their decision, the Inspector will consider the circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at the time of making their decision when considering appeals on grounds (a), (f) and (g)</li>
  <li>at the time the enforcement notice was issued when considering appeals on grounds (b), (c), (d) and (e)</li>
</ul>

<p>See section 4.2 for further information on the grounds of appeal.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>	The role of interested people</h2>

<p>7.1.	People who are interested in the outcome of an appeal but are not one of the main appeal parties play an important role in appeals. Their views in support of, or opposition to, alleged development are taken into account by the Inspector.</p>

<p>7.2.	Interested people are also called ‘third parties’, ‘interested parties’ or ‘interested persons’.</p>

<p>7.3.	Interested people are notified by the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> that the appeal is taking place. Whilst interested people have the opportunity to make representations, they will not be sent copies of representations made by the appellant, <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and other interested people. These documents may be made available for inspection by the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>7.4.	The following guides explain how interested people can take part in appeals:</p>

<h4>8.2.3 The written representations procedure</h4>

<p>8.2.3.1.	In the written representations procedure, the Inspector will decide the appeal based on written material provided by all parties and, usually, after a visit to the appeal site.</p>

<h4>8.2.4 The appellant</h4>

<p>8.2.4.1.	The appellant must submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their appeal</li>
  <li>a copy of the enforcement notice</li>
  <li>other essential supporting documents detailed on the appeal form.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the same time, they must copy the appeal to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>. For further information on how to submit the appeal please see:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-notice-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Enforcement notice appeals: how to complete your appeal form</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-notice-appeals-how-to-complete-your-appeal-form">Listed building enforcement notice appeals: how to complete your appeal form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>8.2.4.2.	The appeal form should disclose the appellant’s case through all the grounds they are appealing on and supporting facts and any available supporting evidence.</p>

<h4>8.2.5 Notification to interested people</h4>

<p>8.2.5.1.	Within 2 weeks of the start date the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must notify the following people that an appeal has been made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Anyone served with a copy of the enforcement notice</li>
  <li>Anyone that occupies a property in the locality of the appeal site</li>
  <li>Any other person who, in the opinion of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, is affected by the alleged breach of planning control</li>
</ul>

<p>The notification must include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a description of the alleged breach of planning control</li>
  <li>a statement of its reasons for issuing the notice</li>
  <li>the steps required to be taken by the enforcement notice</li>
  <li>the appellant’s grounds of appeal against the notice</li>
  <li>the appeal procedure</li>
  <li>an invitation to interested people to make their views known by submitting their views online through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a> within 6 weeks of the start date of the appeal (If the interested person cannot submit their comments online, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> will provide details of how to submit representations by email or post)</li>
  <li>that their views will be disclosed to the appeal parties unless they are withdrawn before the 6 weeks deadline</li>
  <li>that the Planning Inspectorate will not acknowledge receipt of representations</li>
  <li>that they can get a copy of our booklet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-dealt-with-by-written-representations-taking-part">‘Guide to taking part in enforcement appeals and lawful development certificate appeals proceeding by written representations - England’</a> free of charge from the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, or on its website, or on the GOV.UK website</li>
  <li>when and where the appeal documents will be available for inspection</li>
  <li>that the decision will be published online</li>
</ul>

<p>8.2.5.2.	We encourage <abbr title="local planning authorities">LPAs</abbr> to use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-notification-letter-for-enforcement-appeals">model notification letter</a>.</p>

<h4>8.2.6	The appeal questionnaire</h4>

<p>8.2.6.1.	The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must send a completed copy of our questionnaire and copies of all the relevant documents to us and to the appellant within 2 weeks of the start date of the appeal.</p>

<p>8.2.6.2.	The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must indicate on its questionnaire which appeal procedure it considers appropriate, taking account of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria for procedure determination</a>. If this differs from our choice, we will review the procedure</p>

<p>8.2.6.3.	The questionnaire and supporting documents should be enough to present the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>’s full case. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> should notify us and the appellant if it decides to treat the questionnaire and supporting documents as its full representations on an appeal.</p>

<h4>8.2.7 <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>’s representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>8.2.7.1.	If the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> decides it needs to make further representations, it should send these to us within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy these further representations to the appellant.</p>

<h4>8.2.8 The appellant’s representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>8.2.8.1.	The appellant may decide to rely on their appeal form and accompanying documents as their full case.</p>

<p>8.2.8.2.	If, however, the appellant decides to make any further representations, these should be sent to us within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy these further representations to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<h4>8.2.9 Interested people’s representations at the 6-week stage</h4>

<p>8.2.9.1.	To make sure that the Inspector takes their views into account, interested people should send their representations to us. If they send their representations to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> may forward the representations to us for the Inspector’s attention, but they do not need to.</p>

<p>8.2.9.2.	Representations should be submitted online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>. If that isn’t possible, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> will tell interested people how to submit representations by email or post. These must be received within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy any representations received to the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>. There is normally no further opportunity for interested people to make representations after the 6-week stage.</p>

<h4>8.2.10 Comments at the 9-week stage</h4>

<p>8.2.10.1. If either the appellant or the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> wishes to comment on the other’s appeal statement or on any representations made at the 6-week stage, they must send their comments to us within 9 weeks of the start date.</p>

<p>8.2.10.2. These comments should not introduce new material. We will copy the comments to the other appeal party.</p>

<h4>8.2.11 Site visit</h4>

<p>8.2.11.1. Visits to the appeal site and any relevant neighbouring land or properties are normally carried out where it is necessary for the Inspector to assess the impact of a development on its surroundings or measurements need to be taken. The purpose of the visit is solely for the Inspector to view the site and its surroundings.</p>

<p>8.2.11.2. Where the site is sufficiently visible from the road or public viewpoint, the visit will be carried out unaccompanied.</p>

<p>8.2.11.3. Where access is required, it may be necessary for a representative of the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to attend the site visit. Arrangements will be made with neighbours where it is necessary to inspect the site from their property.</p>

<p>8.2.11.4. An accompanied site visit is not an opportunity for those present to discuss the merits of the appeal or the written evidence they have provided. The Inspector will therefore not allow discussion about the appeal with anyone at the site visit. But parties may point out physical features that they have referred to in their written evidence.</p>

<p>8.2.11.5. A site visit won’t be needed for every appeal. It is for the Inspector to decide whether to conduct one.</p>

<h4>8.2.12 Late submissions</h4>

<p>8.2.12.1. Sticking to the timetable is fundamental to a fair and efficient appeal service. Normally If we receive a document after the relevant deadline, we will return it and it will not be seen by the Inspector. See paragraph 8.2.2 for the timetable.</p>

<p>8.2.12.2. However, the Inspector can, at their discretion, accept a late document. They will need an explanation for why it was late, an explanation of how the material contained in it is relevant and to seek the opposing parties’ views on whether it should be accepted.</p>

<p>8.2.12.3. The Inspector will only accept a late document if they are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>
  <li>that it is directly relevant and necessary for their decision</li>
  <li>that it would be procedurally fair to all parties</li>
</ul>

<p>8.2.12.4. If the Inspector does accept a late document, this may disrupt the appeal timetable. In this case, the party that submitted the late document opens themselves up to a costs award as a result either of a costs application by another party or at the initiation of the Inspector. See 2.2 for further information on costs.</p>

<p>8.2.12.5. For further information on late submissions, please see 9.1.</p>

<h4>8.2.13 Audio/video evidence</h4>

<p>8.2.13.1. We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us. We cannot accept audio or video evidence, as we cannot be sure that everyone involved has exactly the same version or that they have the equipment needed to access the evidence. However, you may send a written summary within the 6-week deadline.</p>

<h4>8.3.3	The hearing procedure</h4>

<p>8.3.3.1.	The hearing is a structured discussion led by the Inspector. The Inspector identifies the issues for discussion based on the evidence received and any representations made.</p>

<p>8.3.3.2.	Interested people can attend and may take part in the hearing at the discretion of the Inspector.</p>

<p>8.3.3.3.	Any of the participants may be represented by an advocate, but this is not essential. Any advocate may be legally qualified, but this also is not essential.</p>

<p>8.3.3.4.	The Inspector may adjourn the hearing to the appeal site if discussion on site would better resolve matters.</p>

<p>8.3.3.5.

<p>8.3.10.2.	These comments should not introduce new material. We will copy the comments to the other appeal party.</p>

<h4>8.3.11	Late submissions</h4>

<p>8.3.11.1.	Sticking to the timetable is fundamental to a fair and efficient appeal service. Normally If we receive a document after the relevant deadline, we will return it and it will not be seen by the Inspector. For the hearing timetable, see 8.3.2.</p>

<p>8.3.11.2.	However, the Inspector can, at their discretion, accept a late document. They will need an explanation for why it was late, an explanation of how the material contained in it is relevant and to seek the opposing parties’ views on whether it should be accepted.</p>

<p>8.3.11.3.	The Inspector will only accept a late document if they are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>
  <li>that it is directly relevant and necessary for their decision</li>
  <li>that it would be procedurally fair to all parties</li>
</ul>

<p>8.3.11.4.	If the Inspector does accept a late document, this may disrupt the appeal timetable. In this case, the party that submitted the late document opens themselves up to a costs award as a result either of a costs application by another party or at the initiation of the Inspector. For further information on costs, see section 2.2.</p>

<p>8.3.11.5.	For further information on late submissions, please see section 9.1.</p>

<h4>8.3.12	Openness and transparency</h4>

As long as it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will tell people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>8.3.12.2.	If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h4>8.3.13	Audio/video evidence</h4>

<p>8.3.13.1.	We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the hearing. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, and the main parties. Please send this within the 6-week deadline for representations. Also, you may ask the Inspector at the hearing if he or she is willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the hearing.</p>

<p>8.3.13.2.	It is your responsibility to contact the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>8.3.13.3.	If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector, it will become part of the hearing evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h4>8.4.3	The inquiry procedure</h4>

<p>8.4.3.1.	An inquiry provides for the investigation into, and formal testing of, complex and/or technical evidence, usually through expert witnesses, including by the use of giving evidence on oath and cross-examination. Parties may be formally represented by advocates. The site may be visited before, during or after the inquiry.</p>

<p>8.4.3.2.	We may, at any point before the appeal decision, ‘combine’ procedures. Please see section 5.3 for further information.</p>

<h4>8.4.4	The appellant</h4>

<p>8.4.4.1.	The appellant must submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their appeal</li>
  <li>a copy of the enforcement notice</li>

</ul>

<p>At the same time, they must copy the appeal to the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.</p>

<p>8.4.4.2.	The appeal form should disclose the appellant’s case through all the grounds they are appealing on and supporting facts and any available supporting evidence.</p>

  <li>whether there will be legal representation</li>
  <li>an estimate for the overall inquiry length</li>
</ul>

<p>8.4.4.4.	The appellant should be realistic. The estimate should include time for opening and closing statements, any sessions on conditions and planning obligations and the time they consider may be necessary for questions to be put to both their and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>’s witnesses and to interested people. If the appellant has instructed an advocate, they should get their views on the likely length of the inquiry.</p>

<h4>8.4.5 The appeal questionnaire</h4>

<p>8.4.5.1.	The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must send a completed appeal questionnaire and copies of all the relevant documents to us and to the appellant within 2 weeks of the start date of the appeal. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must indicate on its questionnaire which appeal procedure it considers appropriate, taking account of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/criteria-for-determining-the-procedure-for-planning-enforcement-advertisement-and-discontinuance-notice-appeals">criteria</a>. If this differs from our choice, we will review the procedure.</p>

<p>8.4.5.2.	If, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> agrees that the case ought to be dealt with by inquiry, the expected number of witnesses, topics to be addressed by witnesses, time estimates for the overall inquiry length and the presentation of the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>’s case and whether there will be legal representation should be included with the questionnaire.</p>

<h4>8.4.6	Setting the length of the inquiry</h4>

<p>8.4.6.1.	We will take account of the initial estimates we receive from the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> and our own experience when we set the likely length of the inquiry. Once set we will expect the length of the inquiry to stay within the agreed timetable. A form may be sent later in the process asking for more detailed information on the duration of the inquiry, including detailed information about witnesses and evidence.</p>

<h4>8.4.7	Notification to interested people</h4>

<p>8.4.7.1.	Within 2 weeks of the start date the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must notify the following people that an appeal has been made:</p>

  <li>that the Planning Inspectorate will not acknowledge receipt of representations</li>
  <li>that they can get a copy of our booklet <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/enforcement-appeals-dealt-with-by-an-inquiry-taking-part">guide to taking part in enforcement appeals and lawful development certificate appeals proceeding by inquiry</a> free of charge from the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>, or on its website, or on the GOV.UK website</li>

<p>8.4.8.2.	Representations should be submitted online using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>. If that isn’t possible, the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> will tell interested people how to submit representations by email or post. These must be received within 6 weeks of the start date. We will copy any representations received to the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr>.

<h4>8.4.9	Statement of case</h4>

<p>8.4.9.1.	The appellant and <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must submit a statement of case within 6 weeks of the start date of the appeal.</p>

<p>8.4.9.2.	The statement of case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must include a list of documents, maps and plans the party intends to rely on</li>
  <li>should describe, but not contain, the evidence</li>

  <li>should cite any statutory provisions and case law they intend to use in support of their arguments</li>
  <li>should focus on the areas of differences - as the areas of agreement will be in the statement of common ground (see 8.4.13)</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.4.10	Comments at 9 weeks</h4>

<p>8.4.10.1.	If either the appellant or the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> wish to comment on the other parties’ appeal statements or on any representations made by interested people at the 6-week stage, they must send their comments to us within 9 weeks of the start date. These comments should not introduce new material. We will copy the comments to the other appeal party.</p>

<h4>8.4.11	How people are notified about the inquiry</h4>

<p>8.4.11.1.	We will notify the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> of the date, time and place of the inquiry and the name of the Inspector who will conduct it.</p>

<p>8.4.11.2.	We will ask the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to notify no later than 2 weeks before the inquiry starts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those with an interest in the land</li>
  <li>owners/occupiers of property near the site</li>
  <li>those who made representations on the appeal</li>
  <li>those entitled to appear at the hearing</li>
  <li>anyone else it considers to be affected by or interested in the alleged breach of planning control</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.4.12	Pre-inquiry meeting or pre-inquiry note</h4>

<p>8.4.12.1.	The Inspector may choose to hold a pre-inquiry meeting to discuss the programming of the inquiry and other matters. We will give at least 2 weeks written notice of a pre-inquiry meeting to all appeal parties and any other person the Inspector thinks should attend.</p>

<p>8.4.12.2.	Or the Inspector may issue pre-inquiry notes to the parties covering the same matters that would be dealt with in a meeting.</p>

<h4>8.4.13	Statement of common ground</h4>

<p>8.4.13.1.	The appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must prepare a statement of common ground together which we must receive at least 4 weeks before the inquiry. The appellant is expected to send it to us.</p>

<p>8.4.13.2.	A statement of common ground should identify where the appellant and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> agree and where they differ. This allows the other documents and the inquiry to focus on areas still at issue and reduce time wasted.</p>

<p>8.4.13.3.	The statement should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be a single document, compiled and signed by the main parties</li>
  <li>be concise and not duplicate information already sent</li>

  <li>identify whether there is/is not agreement over measurements, identify agreed elements of the evidence and any technical studies that have been undertaken</li>
  <li>if there is a ground (a) appeal, say if the main parties agree that a reason for issuing the notice can be resolved by conditions and if so, include a list of suggested conditions (agreed and not agreed) which should meet the tests in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">paragraph 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework</a> (see Section 10 for further information)</li>
  <li>where case law is cited, include the full Court report/transcript</li>
  <li>identify whether there are planning obligations which would satisfactorily address one or more of the reasons for issuing the notice (see Section 10 for further information)</li>
</ul>

<p>8.4.13.4.

  <li>not include long irrelevant biographical detail of the witness</li>
</ul>

<p>8.4.14.4.	Witnesses and their advocates should limit the length of proofs. If the proof exceeds 1500 words, a summary should also be provided. It is the summary that will be read out at the inquiry.</p>

<p>8.4.14.5.	If proof of evidence contains evidence given by expert witness, see section 9.4.</p>

<h4>8.4.15	Rule 6</h4>

<p>8.4.15.2.	An interested person that is required to submit a statement of case under this rule, becomes a ‘rule 6 party’. We treat rule 6 parties like the main parties. For example, rule 6 parties will receive copies of the documents sent by us to the other main parties and can take part in drafting the statement of common ground. An interested person may apply for rule 6 status.</p>

<p>8.4.15.3.	For further information, please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-rule-6-status-on-an-enforcement-or-lawful-development-certificate-appeal">Guide to Rule 6 for interested parties involved in an inquiry - enforcement appeals and certificate of lawful use or development appeals – England</a>.</p>

<h4>8.4.16	Late submissions</h4>

<p>8.4.16.1.	Sticking to the timetable is fundamental to a fair and efficient appeal service. Normally If we receive a document after the relevant deadline, we will return it and it will not be seen by the Inspector. See the inquiry timetable in 8.4.2.</p>

<p>8.4.16.2.	However, the Inspector can, at their discretion, accept a late document. They will need an explanation for why it was late, an explanation of how the material contained in it is relevant and to seek the opposing parties’ views on whether it should be accepted.</p>

<p>8.4.16.3.	The Inspector will only accept a late document if they are satisfied that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the content of the statement is not covered in evidence already received</li>
  <li>that it is directly relevant and necessary for their decision</li>
  <li>that it would be procedurally fair to all parties</li>
</ul>

<p>8.4.16.4.	If the Inspector does accept a late document, this may disrupt the appeal timetable. In this case, the party that submitted the late document opens themselves up to a costs award as a result either of a costs application by another party or at the initiation of the Inspector. See section 2.2 for further information on costs.</p>

<p>8.4.16.5.	For further information on late submissions, please see section 9.1.</p>

<h4>8.4.17	Openness and transparency</h4>

<p>8.4.17.1.	Inquiries are open to journalists and the wider public, as well as interested people. Provided that it does not disrupt proceedings, anyone will be allowed to report, record and film proceedings including the use of digital and social media. Inspectors will advise people present at the start of the event that the proceedings may be recorded and/or filmed, and that anyone using social media during or after the end of the proceedings should do so responsibly.</p>

<p>8.4.17.2.	If anyone wants to record or film the event on equipment larger than a smart phone, tablet, compact camera, or similar, especially if that is likely to involve moving around the venue to record or film from different angles, they should contact us and the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> in advance to discuss arrangements.</p>

<h4>8.4.18	Audio/video evidence</h4>

<p>8.4.18.1.	We will return any audio/video evidence sent to us in advance of the inquiry. You may send a written summary which will be seen by the Inspector, and the main parties. Please send this within the 6-week deadline for representations. Also, you may ask the Inspector at the inquiry if he or she is willing to accept the audio/video evidence and allow it to be played at the inquiry.</p>

<p>8.4.18.2.	It is your responsibility to contact the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> to find out whether it has suitable equipment at the venue to access the evidence, or if it will allow you to use your own. The equipment must be suitable to play the evidence so that everyone can see/hear it.</p>

<p>8.4.18.3.	If the evidence is accepted by the Inspector, it will become part of the inquiry evidence and will be retained by the Inspector. You will need to have additional copies of the audio/video evidence available as if the Inspector allows it to be played these copies will be given to the main parties Our Case Officer will be able to tell you how many copies you will need to provide.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>	Other issues</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span>	Late evidence/change in circumstance</h3>

<p>9.1.1.	Whilst we do not usually accept documents submitted after the relevant deadline, sometimes a change in circumstances can mean that we accept late documents on the basis that the parties would not reasonably have been able to comment on the change in circumstances within the deadlines. This includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New or emerging policies – the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must alert us in writing, as soon as possible, of any newly adopted or emerging policies that are relevant to the appeal - it should indicate the anticipated date of adoption of any emerging policy (the appellant may also do this in writing)</li>
  <li>A relevant decision is made on another case - the <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> must alert us in writing, as soon as possible, if it makes a decision (either to grant or refuse planning permission or to issue an enforcement notice) on a similar development and it should alert us if it becomes aware of a decision on an appeal that is relevant (the appellant may also do this in writing)</li>
  <li>New legislation or national policy - If anyone considers that changes to legislation or Government policy or guidance are a material consideration, they should inform us, in writing, as soon as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>9.1.2.	In any of these scenarios, we make the decision on whether to accept late submissions.</p>

<p>9.1.3.	If we decide to accept late submissions, we will agree a date for the receipt of further representations and we will invite all parties (including interested people) to comment.</p>

<p>9.1.4.	The appeal timetable may be affected by late submissions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span>	Postponements, adjournments and abeyance</h3>

<p>9.2.1.	We usually resist postponements and adjournments due to the delay and disruption they cause. We will not put cases into abeyance unless there are exceptional reasons.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span>	Linking appeals</h3>

<p>9.3.1.	We may decide to link appeals that relate to the same site to minimise the use of resources for all parties. We will make decisions to link on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.4 </span>	The role of expert evidence</h3>

<p>9.4.1.	Expert evidence is evidence that is given by a person who is professionally qualified to express an opinion on a particular subject. It can be used in all 3 procedures.</p>

<p>9.4.2.	It is the duty of an expert to help the Inspector. This duty overrides any duty the expert may have to the party that involved them in the appeal or that is paying them.</p>

<p>9.4.3.	The evidence should be accurate, concise, and complete and should represent the expert’s honest and objective opinion. If the expert belongs to a professional body that has a code of practice on professional conduct dealing with giving evidence, the expert is expected to comply with the code.</p>

<p>9.4.4.	Expert evidence should include an endorsement such as that set out below or similar (such as that required by a particular professional body):</p>

<p>“The evidence which I have prepared and provide for this appeal reference APP/xxx (in this proof of evidence, written statement or report) is true [and has been prepared and is given in accordance with the guidance of my professional institution] and I confirm that the opinions expressed are my true and professional opinions.”
This will enable the Inspector and others involved in an appeal to know that the material in a proof of evidence, written statement or report is expert evidence.</p>

<p>9.4.4.1	Giving expert evidence does not prevent an expert from acting as an advocate so long as it is made clear through the endorsement or otherwise what is expert evidence and what is not.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.5 </span>	Contacting us</h3>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>	Conditions and Planning Obligations</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1. </span> Background</h3>

<p>10.1.1. Conditions and planning obligations are only used in enforcement appeals if the appellant pleads ground (a) – see paragraph 4.2.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span>	Conditions</h3>

<p>10.2.1.	If the appellant pleads ground (a), or there is a linked appeal proceeding by <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/78" rel="external">section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>, they should state either on their appeal form or on a separate document when sending in their week-6 statement, whether they would accept or can suggest a planning condition which they think would mitigate the impact of the alleged development.</p>

<p>10.2.2.	The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> should do this either on their questionnaire or as a separate document when sending its week-6 statement.</p>

<p>10.2.3.	The appellant and <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> should look at the planning practice guidance on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-of-planning-conditions">use of planning conditions</a>; and Appendix A – “Suggested Models of Acceptable Conditions for Use in Appropriate Circumstances” (which is still in existence) to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-use-of-conditions-in-planning-permissions-circular-11-1995">Circular 11/95: Use of conditions in planning permission</a> (which has been cancelled).</p>

<p>10.2.4.	The fact that conditions are suggested does not mean that the appeal will be allowed and planning permission granted or that, if allowed, conditions will be put on the permission. A hearing or inquiry will usually include a discussion about the conditions which may be imposed if the enforcement appeal is successful on ground (a) or a linked section 78 appeal is successful.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span>	Planning obligations</h3>

<p>10.3.1.	For guidance on how to use planning obligations please see our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/planning-obligations-good-practice-advice">good practice guide to planning obligations</a>.</p>

<h4>10.3.2	Deadlines for the receipt of planning obligations</h4>

<p>10.3.2.1.	If the appeal is proceeding by written representations and the appellant intends to submit a planning obligation and wants to be certain that it will be taken into account by the Inspector, they must make sure that it is executed, and a certified copy is received by us no later than 9 weeks from the start date</p>

<p>10.3.2.2.	Planning obligations received after this date will be taken into account only at the Inspector’s discretion as they will not delay the issue of a decision to wait for an obligation to be executed, unless there are very exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>10.3.2.3.	If the appeal is proceeding by hearing or Inquiry, there should be a continuous dialogue between the parties in the run up to the hearing or inquiry about the state of the draft section 106 agreement to ensure that the final draft is as good as it can be.</p>

<p>10.3.2.4.	If the appellant intends to send a planning obligation, they should make sure that a final draft, agreed by all parties to it, is received by us no later than 10 working days before the hearing or inquiry opens. The Inspector’s and other parties’ ability to prepare for the hearing or inquiry is likely to be significantly hampered if this deadline is not met.</p>

<p>10.3.2.5.	We ask for a final draft, rather than an executed planning obligation, to allow for the possibility that the wording may need to be changed as a result of discussion and examination during the hearing or inquiry. Nonetheless the planning obligation should normally be executed before the hearing or inquiry closes, without the need for an adjournment. However if that is not practicable the Inspector will agree the details for the receipt of the planning obligation with the appellant and the local planning authority at the hearing or inquiry.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span>	The Decision</h2>

<p>11.1.	When made, the decision will be published online and can be viewed using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/" rel="external">search facility</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">12	Complaints, </span> challenges and feedback</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.1 </span>	Challenge an administrative decision</h3>

<p>12.1.1.	If the appellant, <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> or an interested person believe that we have made an incorrect administrative decision in the way we have processed the appeal, they should write to our Case Officer giving clear reasons why they think we should review our decision. We will review the decision and if we choose to stick with the original decision, we will explain why.</p>

<p>12.1.2.	There is no statutory right to challenge an administrative decision in the High Court. However, it is possible to make an application for judicial review. Rule 54.5(5) of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules" rel="external">Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (as amended)</a> requires that an application for judicial review relating to a decision of the Secretary of State (our administrative staff make decisions about the processing of an appeal on behalf of the Secretary of State) under the planning acts, must be made not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose.</p>

<p>12.1.3.	However, if the appeal is decided before the end of this time limit then the only way to challenge decisions by administrative staff would be as part of the challenge to the appeal decision itself through the High Court (see 12.4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.2 </span>	Complaints</h3>

<p>12.2.1.	If after the decision on an appeal has been published, we receive a complaint against an Inspector’s decision or the Inspector or the way we administered a case, it is dealt with by our Customer Quality team who are independent of the teams that process cases. All complaints are investigated thoroughly and impartially. See our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate/about/complaints-procedure">guide to our complaints procedure</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.3 </span>	Slip rule</h3>

<p>12.3.1.	Please note that, once issued, we are unable to change the appeal decision. The only way to do so is a successful High Court challenge.</p>

<p>12.3.2.	However, under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/5/section/56#:~:text=56Correction%20of%20errors%20in%20decisions&amp;text=(a)if%20he%20is%20requested,is%20considering%20making%20the%20correction." rel="external">section 56 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004</a>, we have the power to correct certain types of errors on our decision notices. This is known as the ‘Slip Rule’. The only corrections we can make are ones which would not alter or vary the appeal decision.</p>

<p>12.3.3.	If any person wants us to consider correcting a decision, they should explain clearly what error they think has been made.</p>

<p>12.3.4.	Any request must be received within the High Court challenge period (see 12.4.3).</p>

<p>12.3.5.	On receipt of a request, we will decide whether a correction should be made. If we issue a correction notice, it will be accompanied by an amended decision (superseding the original decision) which has full legal status. That decision will carry a fresh date and will replace (and be subject to the same provisions as) the original in all respects.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4 </span>	High Court challenges</h3>

<p>12.4.1.	There is a statutory right to challenge the decision on whether to allow or dismiss the appeal (the appeal decision) in the High Court. To do this, you must first apply for permission to submit the challenge.</p>

<p>12.4.2.	There is a statutory right to challenge costs decisions made on appeals where planning permission or listed building consent is granted, or a condition varied or discharged, in the High Court. you must first apply for permission to submit the challenge. All other Costs decisions can be challenged by judicial review (see 12.1.2).</p>

<h4>12.4.3	Deadlines</h4>

<p>12.4.3.1.	Where a ground (a) appeal against an enforcement notice is allowed, permission to make a challenge must be sought within 42 days (6 weeks) beginning with the day after the date of the appeal decision – this period cannot be extended.</p>

<p>12.4.3.2.	If challenging any other decision on an enforcement notice appeal, permission to make a challenge must be sought within 28 calendar days of the date of the decision. The Court can extend this period if it considers there is good reason to do so.</p>

<p>12.4.3.3.	Where a ground (e) appeal against a listed building enforcement notice is allowed, permission to make a challenge must be sought within 42 days (6 weeks) beginning with the day after the date of the appeal decision.</p>

<p>12.4.3.4.	If challenging any other decision on a listed building enforcement notice appeal, permission to make a challenge must be sought within 28 calendar days of the date of the decision. The Court can extend this period if it considers there is good reason to do so.</p>

<p>12.4.3.5.	If challenging a costs decision made on an appeal where planning permission or listed building consent is granted, or a condition varied or discharged, permission to make a challenge must be sought within 42 days (6 weeks) beginning with the day after the date of the costs decision - this period cannot be extended.</p>

<h4>12.4.4	Eligibility for making a challenge</h4>

<p>12.4.4.1.	If the decision is that a ground (a) appeal against an enforcement notice is allowed, any aggrieved person may make a High Court challenge.</p>

<p>12.4.4.2.	If the decision is that a ground (e) appeal against a listed building enforcement notice is allowed, any aggrieved person may make a High Court challenge.</p>

<p>12.4.4.3.	If the decision is a costs decision made on appeal where planning permission or listed building consent is granted, or a condition varied or discharged, any aggrieved person may make a High Court challenge.</p>

<p>12.4.4.4.	For any other appeal decision on both enforcement notice and listed building enforcement notice appeals, only the appellant, <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> or any person with an interest in the land to which the notice relates (see paragraph 2.6.2) can make a High Court challenge.</p>

<p>12.4.4.5.	Other aggrieved people may apply for judicial review by the Courts. The claim form must be filed with the Administrative Court not later than 6 weeks after the grounds to make the claim first arose. The Administrative Court can tell you more about how to do this – see 12.4.8.</p>

<h5>12.4.5	Further guidance on High Court challenges</h5>

<p>12.4.5.1.	Please see the Administrative Court’s detailed guidance on making a High Court challenge for further information:</p>

</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4.6 </span>	If a challenge succeeds</h3>

<p>12.4.6.1.	The appeal returns to the Planning Inspectorate for ‘re-determination’. Please note that the Inspector re-determining the appeal may come to the same decision that gave rise to the challenge but for different or expanded reasons. We usually appoint a different Inspector to make the decision.</p>

<p>12.4.6.2.	We give priority to re-determination cases and they are usually handled quickly.</p>

<p>12.4.6.3.	Where the appeal was originally dealt with by written representations, we would normally re-determine it by means of further written representations. However, where there has been a material change in circumstances, we may opt for a different procedure, having regard to the published criteria.</p>

<p>12.4.6.4.	Where the appeal was originally dealt with by hearing, we would normally re-determine it with an inquiry because we consider that an inquiry would be needed to fully examine the legal issues raised in court. However, where all parties agree that a hearing would be appropriate, we will take this into account when determining the procedure for the re-determined appeal.</p>

<p>12.4.6.5.	Where the appeal was originally dealt with by an inquiry, we would normally re-determine it with an inquiry.</p>

<p>12.4.6.6.	All the documents from the original appeal will be seen by the Inspector appointed to the re-determination. Where there have been significant changes in circumstances (For example, new legislation or local or national policies) since the original decision, the Inspector would normally allow parties to submit further evidence to address these.</p>

<p>12.4.6.7.	The redetermination will not normally follow the usual timetables. We will write to the main parties, and interested parties if appropriate, to let them know what will happen.</p>

<p>12.4.6.8.	Arrangements for redetermination of costs decisions may differ, particularly where the related enforcement appeal decision has been upheld.</p>

<p>12.4.6.9.	We would normally try to agree dates for a hearing or an inquiry through our standard procedure.  Where the re-determined case is proceeding by written representations, we would normally contact the parties to make arrange for a further site visit, unless it has been agreed that a further site visit is unnecessary.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">12.4.7 </span>	Implementing planning permission/commencing development before the time limit for a High Court challenge passes</h3>

<p>12.4.7.1.	There is a risk in implementing a planning permission/commencing development before the High Court challenge time limit has expired. This is because if the planning permission is quashed by the Court, development will become unlawful. The <abbr title="Local Planning Authority">LPA</abbr> may consider taking enforcement action against development that exists without a valid planning permission.</p>
