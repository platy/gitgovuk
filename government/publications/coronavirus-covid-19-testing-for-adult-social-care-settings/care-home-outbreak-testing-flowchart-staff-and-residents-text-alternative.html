<p>A new variant of concern may affect testting procedures: for full instruction follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">COVID-19 adult social care services guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Have there been 2 or more positive COVID-19 cases in a 14-day period?</h2>

<h3>Yes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>contact the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outbreak testing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>day 0/1: all staff and residents take <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing maybe different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information) and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests</li>
      <li>day 4 to 7: staff and residents take one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing maybe different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information) and one <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> on one of these days</li>
      <li>day 7 on: staff continue regular twice weekly symptomatic LFDs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>No:</h3>

<h4>No positive tests:</h4>

<p>Continue regular asymptomatic staff testing. If any staff member or resident becomes symptomatic, they should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on day 0 and then on day 2. If either of these are positive, follow the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a>.</p>

<h4>1 positive case:</h4>

<p>If there is one positive case in the home, staff should conduct rapid response testing of daily LFDs for five days.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Has it been 10 days since the last member of staff or resident tested positive for COVID-19 or experienced symptoms during the outbreak?</h2>

<h3>Yes:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>outbreak recovery testing: all staff and residents conduct a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing maybe different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>were any new positives found?
        <ul>
          <li>yes: <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>) will advise that the outbreak restrictions should continue until no further positives are found</li>
          <li>no: <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="lateral flow device">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>) will advise you can lift outbreak restrictions and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/covid-19-testing-in-adult-social-care">follow normal testing</a>
</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>No:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>outbreak continues: continue regular asymptomatic staff testing and continue <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing aany newly symptomatic individuals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Have there been any positive cases in the home after outbreak recovery testing?</h2>

<h3>Yes:</h3>

<p>This should be classed as a new potential outbreak and the care home should follow the process from <a class="govuk-link" href="#Step1">step 1</a>.</p>

<h3>No:</h3>

<h4>Regular staff asymptomatic testing continues</h4>

<p>If any staff or resident becomes newly symptomatic, they should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test when they become symptomatic. If this test is negative, take another test 48 hours later. If either of these are positive, follow the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a>.</p>
