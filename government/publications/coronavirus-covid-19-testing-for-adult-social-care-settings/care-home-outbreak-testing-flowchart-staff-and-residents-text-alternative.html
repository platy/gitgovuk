<p>A new variant of concern may affect testing procedures: for full instructions follow the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings">COVID-19 adult social care services guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Have there been 2 or more positive COVID-19 cases in a 14-day period?</h2>

<h3>NO</h3>

<h4>No positive tests</h4>

<p>Continue regular asymptomatic staff testing. If any staff member or resident becomes symptomatic, they should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test on day 0 and then on day 2. If either of these are positive, follow the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a>.</p>

<h4>Positive case</h4>

<p>If there is one positive case in the home, staff should conduct rapid response testing for 5 days. If there are further cases with the 5-day period:</p>

<p>1. Continue testing, but do not extend the rapid response testing period beyond 5 days.
2. Contact the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>).</p>

<h3>YES</h3>

<h4>Contact the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr>
</h4>

<p>An outbreak is 2 or more positive or suspected linked cases of COVID-19 that occur in the same setting within a 14-day period.</p>

<p>Contact the <abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>) if you suspect an outbreak.</p>

<h3>Outbreak testing</h3>

<h4>Day 0/1</h4>
<p>All staff and residents take <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing may be different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information) and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests.</p>

<h4>Day 4 to 7</h4>
<p>Staff and residents take one <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing may be different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information) and one <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> on one of these days.</p>

<h4>Day 7 and after</h4>
<p>Staff continue regular twice weekly symptomatic LFDs.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Has it been 10 days since the last member of staff or resident tested positive for COVID-19 or experienced symptoms during the outbreak?</h2>

<h3>NO</h3>

<h4>Outbreak continues</h4>

<p>Continue regular asymptomatic staff testing and continue <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing any newly symptomatic individuals.</p>

<h3>YES</h3>

<h4>Outbreak recovery testing</h4>

<p>All staff and residents conduct a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> (if an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days, their testing may be different. Read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a> for further information) test.</p>

<h3>Were any new positives found?</h3>

<h4>Yes</h4>

<p><abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, Local Authority or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>) will advise that the outbreak restrictions should continue until no further positives are found.</p>

<h4>No</h4>

<p><abbr title="health protection teams">HPT</abbr> (or if applicable, your community infection prevention and control team, Local Authority or <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCG</abbr>) will advise you can lift outbreak restrictions and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings/covid-19-testing-in-adult-social-care">follow normal testing</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Have there been any positive cases in the home after outbreak recovery testing?</h2>

<h3>NO</h3>

<h4>Regular staff asymptomatic testing continues</h4>

<p>If any staff or resident becomes newly symptomatic, they should take an <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test when they become symptomatic. If this test is negative, take another test 48 hours later. If either of these are positive, follow the guidance in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement"><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>-COVID-19 supplement</a>.</p>

<h3>YES</h3>

<p>This should be classed as a new potential outbreak and the care home should follow the process from <a class="govuk-link" href="#Step1">step 1</a>.</p>
