<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This guidance is for adult social care providers and staff to set out the current testing regime across adult social care. Informed by public health advice which takes account of the epidemiology of COVID-19, the aim of this testing regime is to ensure, where advised, that people have access to testing to enable COVID-19 positive cases to be identified quickly, so action can be taken to stop the spread.  We will keep this guidance under review as prevalence changes and  as knowledge of current and future COVID-19 variants increases.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> How to use this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance replaces all previous guidance for testing in adult social care and applies to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>care homes</li>
  <li>homecare organisations</li>
  <li>extra care and supported living services</li>
  <li>adult day care centres</li>
  <li>personal assistants</li>
  <li>shared lives carers</li>
  <li>social workers</li>
</ul>

<p>Sections that are specific to a type of service will be clearly signposted.</p>

<p>This guidance uses the term ‘testing coordinator’ to describe the role that the person ordering and overseeing testing has in the process. The testing coordinator may be the service manager, or someone else who has responsibility for testing in the service.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Eligibility for free testing in adult social care</h3>

<p>Staff in an organisation eligible for testing include paid members of staff or volunteers who regularly attend a service (for example, a care home or adult day care centre). This includes cleaners, catering, and support staff but does not include office-based staff members who do not enter these settings. In the context of an individual’s own home, staff includes those who are paid to provide care or support to the individual.</p>

<p>Care homes and homecare organisations are eligible for free testing if they are regulated by the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>).</p>

<p>Extra care and supported living settings are eligible if they meet at least one of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the setting is a closed community with substantial facilities shared between multiple people</li>
  <li>it is a setting where the majority of residents (more than 50%) receive the kind of personal care that is <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-regulated (rather than help with cooking, cleaning and shopping)</li>
</ul>

<p>If a setting meets both criteria above, it is classified as a ‘high-risk extra care and supported living setting’. Where there is a distinction in testing for high-risk settings, this is made clear throughout the guidance.</p>

<p>Day care centres are eligible if they are run by paid care staff. Services must be for adults over 18 and must be provided within non-residential care settings that support the health and wellbeing of adults. This includes settings such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>purpose-built day centres</li>
  <li>day centres attached to or part of a care home or supported living setting</li>
  <li>other buildings in communities specifically used for regular adult day care</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal assistants are eligible if they are directly employed by an individual (or self-employed) to provide care and support to an adult to enable them to live as independently as possible. This care could include support in the home, or to go out into the community.</p>

<p>Shared Lives carers are eligible if they are working with a regulated Shared Lives scheme to provide care and support to an adult to enable them to live as independently as possible. This includes both carers who live with the person they support and those who live separately.</p>

<p>Social workers are eligible if they work with adults requiring support for their health, wellbeing and social care needs and are regulated by Social Work England.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Testing regimes for adult social care</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Symptomatic testing for staff and residents</h3>

<p>Symptomatic lateral flow device (<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) testing is available for all staff described in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section1-2">section 1.2</a> and all residents in care homes and extra care and supported living services which meet one or both of the criteria listed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section1-2">section 1.2</a>. For details of COVID-19 symptoms and when symptomatic testing is needed, as well as testing after a positive result, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/covid-19-supplement-to-the-infection-prevention-and-control-resource-for-adult-social-care">COVID-19 supplement to the infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) resource for adult social care</a>.</p>

<p>As far as possible, residents should be offered the choice to either self-administer the tests or to have the tests administered by a suitable member of staff.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Asymptomatic staff testing</h3>

<p>At this time, whilst prevalence  of COVID-19 is relatively low, staff should no longer conduct regular asymptomatic staff testing. Some staff without COVID-19 symptoms may be asked to undertake testing as part of rapid response testing for care homes and high-risk extra care and supported living services (<a class="govuk-link" href="#RAPIDRESPONSE">section 2.3</a>), or as part of outbreak testing in care homes (<a class="govuk-link" href="#OUTBREAKTESTING">section 2.4</a>).</p>

<p>Care homes enrolled in the Vivaldi study may be asked to undertake additional asymptomatic testing to support ongoing research and surveillance in the sector. Care homes that participate in this study should follow any separate guidance they receive.</p>

<p>At this time, it is not recommended that staff should conduct any further asymptomatic testing beyond these situations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Rapid response testing in care homes and high-risk extra care and supported living</h3>

<p>If one or more positive cases (staff or resident) are found in a care home, or high-risk extra care and supported living setting, then daily rapid&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;testing should be conducted for 5 consecutive days for all staff working on those days. This is not extended if further positive cases are found within the 5 days. Only the staff working in the setting over the rapid response testing period need to be tested; those not working during this period do not need to be tested. You should not bring people into work to get tested on their non-working days.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Outbreak testing in care homes</h3>

<p>This section applies only to care homes. NHS Test and Trace <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests should not be used for outbreak testing in other adult social care services.</p>

<p>An outbreak consists of 2 or more positive (or clinically suspected) linked cases of COVID-19 that occur in the same setting within a 14-day period (this means where the cases are linked to transmission in the care setting). This applies to both staff and residents, and includes&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;results.</p>

<p>If the manager suspects an outbreak in the care home, they should contact the health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) (or community infection prevention and control team, local authority, or integrated care board (<abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>) in accordance with local protocols) who will conduct a risk assessment, including whether the cases are likely to be linked. Following this risk assessment, the&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>&nbsp;may advise whole home outbreak testing.</p>

<p>If the care home is advised to initiate whole home outbreak testing, in addition to completing rapid response testing for staff, all staff and residents should conduct both an&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;test and a&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test on day 1 of the outbreak and another&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;test and&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test between days 4 and 7. The&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;test will allow the identification and isolation of the most infectious cases immediately whilst awaiting&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;results, therefore reducing the risk of the virus spreading.</p>

<p>If either test is positive, it is highly likely that the individual has COVID-19.</p>

<p>After the first week of outbreak testing has been completed, staff do not need to do any further testing unless they become symptomatic or unless requested as part of any outbreak recovery testing. Outbreak recovery testing should be conducted once there have been at least 10 days with no new linked cases occurring due to likely spread within the care home (<a class="govuk-link" href="#RECOVERY">see section 2.4.1</a>).</p>

<p>The local&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>&nbsp;may decide to differ from this approach based on the local circumstances, and where possible their instructions should be followed. For example, there may be circumstances in which the&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>&nbsp;or other local partner advises that the original cases were considered highly unlikely to be linked to transmission within the setting (a cluster) and they advise that outbreak measures may be stood down after 2 rounds of whole home&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;testing (at around the 7 day point).</p>

<h4>2.4.1 Outbreak recovery testing</h4>

<p>Outbreak recovery testing is undertaken to confirm that transmission of COVID-19 within the care home has ended, and therefore allowing outbreak measures to be lifted.</p>

<p>Apart from those who have tested positive in the last 90 days, all staff and residents should do a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test at least 10 days after the last case of COVID-19 in the care home in either staff or residents. This should be 10 days from the last symptom onset date (where symptoms are confirmed as COVID-19 by testing), or 10 days from the last positive test if asymptomatic.</p>

<h5>2.4.1.1 If there are only negative results from outbreak recovery testing</h5>

<p>If there are no positive&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;results from outbreak recovery testing, outbreak measures can be lifted.</p>

<p>If 2 or more linked positive cases are subsequently identified, this should be classed as a new outbreak and the care home should contact the&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> again.</p>

<h5>2.4.1.2 If there are any positive results from outbreak recovery testing</h5>

<p>If there are further positive results identified, the new cases could be linked to the original outbreak. Care homes may seek advice from their local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> (<abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr>, <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr> or community infection control team according to local processes) for this assessment, together with advice on when it might be reasonable to lift outbreak measures.</p>

<p>If this assessment finds that the further cases are likely part of the same outbreak, the care home should wait another 10 days with no positive results to conduct another round of outbreak recovery testing. The care home should not do any further rounds of whole home testing in this period.</p>

<h5>2.4.1.3 Outbreak recovery testing and variants of concern</h5>

<p>The local&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>&nbsp;will contact the care home if they have identified a particular variant of concern or variant under investigation which requires additional actions or measures. They will discuss whether additional measures need to be put in place to enable additional protection and how this impacts the testing required. This might include delaying the whole home outbreak recovery testing until 28 days from the latest case.</p>

<span class="number">3. </span> Step by step testing process for adult social care</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Ordering test kits</h3>

<h4>3.1.1 Accessing through a unique organisation number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>) - applies to care homes, homecare, extra care and supported living and day care centres only</h4>

<p>Personal assistants, Shared Lives carers and social workers should go straight to <a class="govuk-link" href="#KITWITHOUTUON">section 3.1.2</a>.</p>

<h5>3.1.1.1 Unique organisation number</h5>

<p>NHS Test and Trace assigns all participating organisations a single Unique Organisation Number (<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>).</p>

<p>A <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> is an 8-digit number that is exclusive to an individual organisation. This can be used to log in to all online elements of the testing process.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> will be needed for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordering test kits</li>
  <li>registering test kits</li>
  <li>contacting the national COVID-19 contact centre for support (dial 119)</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure the <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>&nbsp;is correct when logging into the portal. If the&nbsp;<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>&nbsp;entered is not valid, a new error message screen will appear. To find out the <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>&nbsp;for a service, use the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external"><abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>&nbsp;look-up page</a>, or call 119.</p>

<h5>3.1.1.2 Onboarding for testing in extra care, supported living, and adult day care centres</h5>

<p>Use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-onboarding.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">self-referral portal</a> to request a testing account. To do this, the manager should complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the portal, where asked to enter the ‘Referrer’s Unique Organisation Number’, enter  99874802 for extra care and supported living or 99915258 for adult day care centres. The code only needs to be used once and it cannot be used to order test kits.</li>
  <li>Complete the eligibility questions.</li>
  <li>Enter the information for the setting, including delivery address and contact details.</li>
  <li>Submit referral.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the referral is submitted, the following happens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the referral is sent to the local authority for approval</li>
  <li>the local authority assesses if the service meets the eligibility criteria, and approves or denies the referral request</li>
  <li>if eligible, the service is on-boarded onto the system and will be eligible to place an order for test kits</li>
  <li>a confirmation email will be sent to the email address registered on the self-referral portal once the service has been onboarded – and will include a <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> to order test kits</li>
</ul>

<h5>3.1.1.3 Ordering test kits with a <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> – applies to care homes, homecare, extra care and supported living and day care centres only</h5>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">Place an order of COVID-19 tests online</a>. A service should keep enough test kits to prepare for if staff (and residents where applicable) need to test, if they become symptomatic, following a positive test, and any rapid response or outbreak testing where applicable. A service  should only order more test kits when needed to replenish stocks. Care homes returning&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;tests through a courier can also order return boxes through the same portal. To apply, they will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>
</li>
  <li>total number of staff for testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an order has been placed , the service  will receive a confirmatory email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a></p>

<p>The testing coordinator will receive an email from <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk">organisation.coronavirus.testing@notifications.service.gov.uk</a> when their test kits have been dispatched, informing them of their delivery date.</p>

<p>Test kits will be delivered to the address registered to the <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Call 119 for any questions about an order. If a service is close to running out of stock and requires an urgent and emergency delivery, they should also call 119.</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Ordering test kits without a <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr> – applies to personal assistants, Shared Lives carers, social workers and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors only</h4>

<p>Personal assistants (or their employers on their behalf), Shared Lives carers, social workers and <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr> inspectors should order tests via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests">online government portal</a>. They do not need a <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Employers of  personal assistants ordering tests on their behalf should go through the ordering journey selecting options as if they are a personal assistant. Whilst tests can be ordered on behalf of others, tests should only be used for staff and not those who are receiving care and/or support.</p>

<p>Individuals who are already part of a regular testing regime at work should not access tests through this route.</p>

<p>Individuals should keep enough test kits in case they need to test because they become symptomatic and they  should only order more tests when needed to replenish stocks. When replenishing stocks for this purpose, they should select that they are symptomatic when going through the ordering portal.</p>

<p>An individual can choose which address their test  kits are delivered to. Once they have placed an order, they will receive a confirmatory email.</p>

<p>For any issues with ordering test kits, please call the national COVID-19 contact centre on 119.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Receive test kits</h3>

<p>When the test kits are received, please ensure that all kits are stored in line with the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Testing days</h3>

<p>Testing should be conducted in the circumstances detailed in <a class="govuk-link" href="#SECTION2">section 2</a>. Individuals should follow the instructions given in the test kits, and ensure they check these each time they order new tests as they may receive different types of kits.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Registering and reporting testing</h3>

<h4>3.4.1 Register and return <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests – applies to care homes only</h4>

<p>Every <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test must be registered to receive a result. Where applicable, <abbr title="polymerase chain reactions">PCRs</abbr> should be registered using the organisation’s&nbsp;<abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>. Note the barcode number and time of each&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test against the name of the person tested. Register the completed test online as close as possible to the time of the swab. <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;tests can be registered individually or using the multiple upload spreadsheet (<a class="govuk-link" href="#MULTIREGISTRATION">see section 3.4.3</a>).</p>

<p><abbr title="polymerase chain reactions">PCRs</abbr> can be returned using priority post boxes – collection times of the post box should be checked prior to testing. Couriers are also available for returning 9 or more tests.</p>

<h4>3.4.2 Report <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results – applies to all staff and services</h4>

<p>Reporting the result of every <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test is encouraged, even if it is negative or void. Staff members can <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result">register <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests individually</a>, or managers can register them in bulk using the multiple upload spreadsheet (<a class="govuk-link" href="#MULTIREGISTRATION">see section 3.4.3</a>). Where organisations have a <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>, staff should report results using that <abbr title="Unique Organisation Number">UON</abbr>.</p>

<p>Providers do not need to retain records of proof of registrations.</p>

<p>Individuals in care homes, extra care and supported living services, adult day care centres, and homecare organisations can use the Digital Reader for reading <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test results as part of the self-report journey. This tool allows users to take a photo of their <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> and uses artificial intelligence to determine the result of the test. Research has shown that users can correctly identify more positive results using this technology than without it.  For detailed information, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/338928724/COVID-19+%E2%80%93+Digital+reader+guide.pdf/0ea2af24-3600-0224-af23-8b5bf719a7ea?t=1642782196189" rel="external">download the Digital Reader guidebook</a>.</p>

<h4>3.4.3 Multiple registration spreadsheet</h4>

<p>Only use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organisation-testing-registration-record-of-users">multiple upload spreadsheet</a> to register up to 100 tests (both <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>) at a time.</p>

<p>Services will need to use separate record keeping spreadsheets for staff and residents.</p>

<p>Once each <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> has been successfully registered, a confirmation email will be received. When receiving  the test result email, this may not include the name of the resident or staff member. Services should therefore retain a careful record of each test barcode and the name of the resident or staff member. Staff members should also retain a record of their own test barcode.</p>

<h4>3.4.4 Registering and reporting on behalf of others</h4>

<p>If  staff or residents cannot report their own <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> test result online:</p>

<ul>
  <li>results can be reported on the individual’s behalf</li>
  <li>the person reporting on behalf of the individual will need all test results and test strip ID numbers so that they can report results on their behalf</li>
  <li>make sure that you delete or destroy any forms containing the tested person’s personal details as soon as you complete the online registration</li>
</ul>

<p>If an individual cannot register their own <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test, please follow the details in <a class="govuk-link" href="#REGISTERandRETURNtest">section 3.4.1</a> to do this individually or <a class="govuk-link" href="#MULTIREGISTRATION">section 3.4.3</a> to do this for a group of people.</p>

<p>If any individual cannot complete the online form and someone can’t report the result on their behalf, they can call 119 and select option 1 to report their result.</p>

<p>Full information about what to do if staff or residents receive a positive&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;test result can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/covid-19-supplement-to-the-infection-prevention-and-control-resource-for-adult-social-care">COVID-19 supplement to the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> resource for adult social care</a>.</p>

<p>If anybody tests positive on-site, they should wear a face mask if possible and should return home immediately and follow the guidance for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-symptoms-of-a-respiratory-infection-including-covid-19#what-to-do-if-you-have-a-positive-covid-19-test-result">people with symptoms of a respiratory infection including COVID-19</a>. If possible, they should return home using private transport.</p>

<h4>3.5.1 Individuals with a negative COVID-19 result</h4>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu.</p>

<p>Staff members who receive a negative result and remain without symptoms can continue working.  Staff can return to work if they are no longer unwell and they do not have a high temperature.</p>

<p>Symptomatic people receiving care should be advised to keep away from others until 48 hours after their symptoms have resolved. Further actions may still be needed to limit transmission including using appropriate personal protection equipment (<abbr title="Personal protection equipment">PPE</abbr>) when working with people who are unwell.</p>

<h4>3.5.2 When to contact the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> (or local public health response contact)</h4>

<p>Services should contact their <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> after receiving 2 or more linked positive COVID-19 results in the same setting within a 14-day period. They should not delay contacting their <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, as interventions are more effective the earlier they are started. If locally a service speaks to a community infection prevention and control team, <abbr title="local authority">LA</abbr> or <abbr title="integrated care board">ICB</abbr>, they should notify them of the suspected outbreak. In these settings, they may be advised that additional testing outside of the ‘rapid response testing’ may be needed.</p>

<h4>3.5.3 Testing within 90 days of a positive result</h4>
<p><br></p>

<h5>3.5.3.1 Exemptions from <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing for individuals who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 within 90 days</h5>

<p>Fragments of inactive virus can be persistently detected by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests in respiratory tract samples following infection, and for some time after a person has completed their isolation period and is no longer infectious.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic staff and residents who do not have severe immunosuppression, and who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 by <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> or <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test should be exempt from testing by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> within 90 days from the initial illness onset or test date. This does not apply if they develop new COVID-19 symptoms.</p>

<p>This exemption includes patients without severe immunosuppression, who require testing within 48 hours prior to discharge to a care home.</p>

<p>This exemption does not apply to <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> testing. <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> tests can be conducted within 90 days of a positive COVID-19 test result. If staff or residents are tested with an&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;test within 90 days of a prior positive&nbsp;<abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr>&nbsp;test and the result is positive, residents should start a new period of self-isolation and staff should stay away from work (see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/infection-prevention-and-control-in-adult-social-care-covid-19-supplement/covid-19-supplement-to-the-infection-prevention-and-control-resource-for-adult-social-care">COVID-19 supplement to the&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;resource for adult social care</a>), unless a clinical or risk assessment suggests that a re-infection is unlikely. This risk assessment should inform subsequent action including whether isolation is required.</p>

<p>Guidance on reinfection and performing clinical risk assessment is detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections">Investigation and management of suspected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections: a guide for clinicians and infection specialists</a>.</p>

<h5>3.5.3.2 Assessment of repeat <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> positive test results within 90 days of a prior positive test</h5>

<p>If an individual is re-tested by <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> within 90 days of initial illness onset or prior positive COVID-19 test and the <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test result is positive, a clinical risk assessment should be used to decide whether a new infection (‘<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections/investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections-a-guide-for-clinicians-and-infection-specialists">reinfection</a>’) is a possibility and to inform subsequent action including whether isolation is required.</p>

<p>Guidance on reinfection and performing clinical risk assessment is detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-investigation-and-management-of-suspected-sars-cov-2-reinfections">Investigation and management of suspected SARS-CoV-2 reinfections: a guide for clinicians and infection specialists</a>.</p>

<p>The advice of an infection specialist should be sought to inform clinical risk assessment.</p>

<h4>3.5.4 Accessing COVID-19 treatments for people in the highest risk group</h4>

<p>Individuals who are in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-care-and-treatments-for-coronavirus" rel="external">highest risk group</a> from COVID-19 can access new COVID-19 treatments directly.</p>

<p>Tests have been sent directly to these individuals to enable faster treatment of COVID-19 if they develop symptoms and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow-tests">more tests can be ordered from GOV.UK</a> if required. In residential settings that conduct symptomatic testing, existing stock of tests can also be used.</p>

<p>Eligible individuals should have received a ‘pre-notification’ letter or email (to the contact details specified in their GP record) to alert them that they have a condition, or are on a specific treatment, that may make them eligible should they test positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Service and care managers are requested to support people who are potentially eligible for treatment with where to store these  tests so that they are available to be used if the individual experiences COVID-19 symptoms. Each test kit will have an information leaflet enclosed which details how these kits should be stored and provides full testing and reporting instructions.</p>

<p>Their test result must be reported via GOV.UK or 119 in order to generate a referral to a COVID-19 Medicines Delivery Unity (<abbr title="COVID-19 Medicines Delivery Unity">CMDU</abbr>) where an individual has been digitally identified as eligible for treatment. When reporting their result, it is important to provide the individual’s NHS number and the postcode that is recorded with their GP, so that they can be identified as eligible for treatment. A phone number should also be provided so that they, or care staff, can be contacted.</p>

<p>If positive for COVID-19, the person  or care home will be contacted by a <abbr title="COVID-19 Medicines Delivery Unity">CMDU</abbr> clinician who will assess the person’s  eligibility and decide whether treatment is appropriate and if so, which treatment might be most appropriate. A range of treatments are available, including intravenous and oral (tablet or capsule-based) treatment options. Most treatments have to be provided within 5 days of symptom onset, so timely reporting of test results is essential to identify and assess potentially eligible people within the treatment window.</p>

<p>If the person is not contacted within 24 hours of receiving the positive result, contact their GP or call 111 who will refer them to a <abbr title="COVID-19 Medicines Delivery Unity">CMDU</abbr> if they are potentially eligible.</p>

<p>Further <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/treatments-for-coronavirus/" rel="external">information on treatments for COVID-19</a> is available on the NHS website. 119 can assist with any queries regarding <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> ordering or reporting <abbr title="lateral flow device">LFD</abbr> results. 119 do not have any role in referring patients to a <abbr title="COVID-19 Medicines Delivery Unity">CMDU</abbr>.</p>
