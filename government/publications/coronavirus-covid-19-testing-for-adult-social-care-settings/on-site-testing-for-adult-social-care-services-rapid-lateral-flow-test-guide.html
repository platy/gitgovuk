<p>This guidance is for all adult social care services where on-site testing is conducted using rapid lateral flow tests.</p>

<p>This guidance is for assisted on-site testing with rapid lateral flow tests, which may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff</li>
  <li>visiting professionals</li>
  <li>people getting care and support from social care services</li>
  <li>other visitors (family and friends)</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Before you do any testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance in its entirety</li>
  <li>make sure you have received all parts of your order</li>
  <li>ensure that your staff and visitors are fully prepared for testing days</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on how to prepare and manage on-site lateral flow testing. On-site testing can reduce the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) but it does not completely remove the risk of infection. All other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures must continue to be followed.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Order more test kits online</a></p>

<p>If you have received a handheld scanner for easier registration, make sure you have <a href="#set-up-scanner" class="govuk-link">set it up</a> and familiarised your staff with how to use it.</p>

<h2>Overview of the rapid lateral flow testing process</h2>

<h3>Order kits</h3>

<p>Once you order test kits, youâll be sent an order confirmation when they are dispatched. You will receive rapid lateral flow test kits, universal test kits for confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> tests and a box of supplementary kit.</p>

<p>Start planning in advance so that you are ready to begin testing when the test kits are delivered to you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>communicate the testing approach to all testing staff</li>
  <li>read this guidance and ensure all relevant staff take the NHS online training</li>
  <li>plan out your testing area and workflow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prepare testing area</h3>

<p>On the days of testing, set up the testing area in your service, including a check-in area and place to conduct testing and await results.</p>

<p>Key considerations for the testing area are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prepare consent forms to get formal consent for testing and sharing results</li>
  <li>make sure there is a separate area for people being tested to enter, test and await results without entering other parts of the building or home. If possible, this area should have a separate entrance</li>
  <li>where relevant, make sure people being tested can enter and immediately put on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Where this is not possible, people should put on any necessary <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> before entering the service</li>
  <li>follow other key considerations include social distancing, disability access and fire safety regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conduct testing</h3>

<p>For each day of testing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where applicable, provide the person being tested with <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> upon entrance and get their consent to be tested</li>
  <li>make sure your homeâs <a rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</a> is visible to register and log test results</li>
  <li>prepare test kits including the swabs, extraction materials, test tube racks and rapid lateral flow test (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>) devices</li>
  <li>prepare devices to use for registering visitor tests and results</li>
  <li>make sure to support the person being tested with registering their kit online, if needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analyse test samples</h3>

<p>A trained member of staff analyses and interprets results.</p>

<p>Follow the test instructions to prepare, collect and record sample results. Note the ID number on each rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device (QR code) against the time each sample was placed onto the rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Communicate the results to each person being tested, who must then register their test kit result online (unless a processing operative does this on behalf of the person being tested).</p>

<p>If a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> is positive, the person being tested needs to take and register a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test on site. Then they should return home and isolate immediately. If their confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> is positive, their household or bubble will also need to self-isolate and NHS Test and Trace may be in touch to contact trace.</p>

<h2>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> technology, training and safety</h2>

<p>Rapid lateral flow testing involves processing a throat and nasal swab sample with an extraction fluid and a rapid lateral flow test (<abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr>).</p>

<p>The rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> detects a coronavirus (COVID-19) antigen that is produced when a person is infectious with coronavirus (COVID-19). If this antigen is present, then a coloured strip will appear which indicates a positive result.</p>

<p>We will be providing you with Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test Kits.</p>

<p>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> find at least half of the cases that <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> testing detect and about three-quarters of those who have very high amounts of virus present when an individual is tested. High amounts of virus mean that an individual is more likely to be infectious. They are helpful in detecting cases either much earlier or that would not be detected by other testing strategies in use routinely.</p>

<p>Rapid lateral flow testing is not a foolproof solution: it should be seen as an addition to <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> and other infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures and must not be seen as a way of relaxing their use.</p>

<h3>Safety considerations</h3>

<p>On-site testing must be conducted in line with other safety and risk management protocols, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>separating the on-site testing workflow from other parts of the home</li>
  <li>cleaning the testing area between tests and following <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> contamination protocol</li>
  <li>keeping any devices used for registration clean between each use and following contamination <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures carefully</li>
  <li>using clean and dirty entrances for the testing area, if possible</li>
  <li>having an agreed upon procedures set for invalid rapid lateral flow tests and any persons who cannot or refuse to test</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Kits can be stored at room temperature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>store extraction solution at 2Â°C to 30Â°C</li>
  <li>store the test cartridge at 2Â°C to 30Â°C</li>
</ul>

<h3>Waste management</h3>

<p>Dispose of used rapid <abbr title="lateral flow tests">LFTs</abbr> in a health care waste bin.</p>

<h3>Ordering more kits</h3>

<p>Order more test kits using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://request-testing.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/" rel="external">online order portal for care homes</a>.</p>

<h3>What happens with a positive result?</h3>

<p>If a person being tested received a positive rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> result, they will need to take a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit on site and immediately self-isolate, following government guidelines whilst awaiting their <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result.</p>

<p>Make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you provide the person being tested with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit and they complete testing on site</li>
  <li>the person being tested registers their test kit online using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-for-coronavirus-at-home" class="govuk-link">testing yourself at home</a> instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>The person being tested should then immediately return home, avoiding public transport and wearing a face mask. If the person being tested receives a positive confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> result, their household or bubble will also need to self-isolate and NHS Test and Trace may be in touch to contact trace. For more information on results guidance, see the <a href="#results-analysis" class="govuk-link">results analysis</a> section below.</p>

<h3>Getting consent and registering results</h3>

<p>Persons being tested will need to provide consent to be tested and share their results. You need to get consent before any testing occurs.</p>

<p>Once test results are determined, the person being tested should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">register their test kit online</a> using a self-test registration form. You should provide a web-enabled device, if possible, to support any person that does not have a mobile phone.</p>

<p>A web-enabled device includes a mobile phone or iPad, or a computer if you plan to register results after each testing day. Make sure the device is kept clean between each use and that <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are carefully followed. If someone has to use a device in the middle of the testing process, the device should be cleaned.</p>

<p>What the person being tested will need for registration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>personal details including date of birth (DOB), gender, ethnicity</li>
  <li>contact information</li>
  <li>the ID number of the rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> (a series of numbers and QR code on the actual device)</li>
  <li>date and time of the test</li>
  <li>the test result</li>
  <li>your <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://organisation-number-lookup.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/">unique organisation number (<abbr title="unique organisation number">UON</abbr>)</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note" aria-label="Warning">
<p>Registration should happen as soon as the test result is determined (and no later than one day after testing). You will need the ID number on the device to register the result.</p>
</div>

<p>If a person being tested is unable to register their own result, you can register the test on their behalf.</p>

<p>Because the registration form asks for personal information, you will need these details from each person being tested and must state how you will use those details, how long you will keep that information, and who you will share it with.</p>

<p>Make that you delete or destroy any forms containing the tested personâs personal details as soon as you complete with the online registration. For more information on registering test results, see the <a href="#process-and-record-results" class="govuk-link">process and record results</a> section below.</p>

<h2>How to use the handheld scanner</h2>

<h3>Set up your handheld scanner</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Turn off your computerâs power before connecting the scanner.</li>
  <li>Plug the cable into the bottom of the scanner and plug the other end into a computer.</li>
  <li>Turn on the computer once the scanner is fully connected.</li>
  <li>The computer should recognise the scanner automatically as a USB keyboard device.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Registering with a handheld scanner</h3>

<p>To use the scanning device when registering a single person on the registration portal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the page âEnter the unique test kit barcodeâ, select âTest kit barcode referenceâ.</li>
  <li>Scan the barcode using your handheld scanner. This automatically adds it to the box.</li>

  <li>you are prepared to have a clear record of which device matches which individualâs result</li>
  <li>you have a mirror, timer, permanent markers, hand sanitiser and health care waste bins in the testing area</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing process checklist</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The person being tested checks in and registers the test kit (before or after swab).</li>
  <li>Take the swab sample (tonsils then nose).</li>
  <li>Process the sample and apply it to the rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device.</li>
  <li>Wait 30 minutes then read the results.</li>
  <li>Register the test kit and result onto the online registration form.</li>
  <li>Take the relevant post-test action.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prepare your testing area</h3>

</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Check in the person being tested</h2>

<h3>Take down registration details (if the person being tested cannot register their own kit)</h3>

<p>If the person being tested will not be able to register their own result online, make sure to explain that you are asking for their personal information to register the test kit on their behalf: see the <a class="govuk-link" href="#process-and-record-results">process and record results</a> section below.</p>

<p>To complete the registration form, take down the following personal details of each person being tested.</p>

<p>These details can be recorded before or after the testing process occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>full name</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>ethnic group</li>
  <li>home address</li>
  <li>contact details, including mobile number and email address</li>
</ul>

<h3>Move to swabbing area</h3>

<p>The person being tested can now move to the area for swabbing and sample collection.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Sample collection</h2>

<h3>Test kit preparation</h3>

<p>The processing operative, a trained member of staff, prepares the test kit including the extraction tube and extraction solution to process individual samples.</p>

<p>The staff member then hands the person being tested the packaged swab.</p>

<h3>Complete self-swab</h3>

<p>The person being tested un-packs the swab and self-administers the swab sample for both the throat and nose.</p>

<p>The person being tested should hold their used swab until the processing operative is ready to process their test sample.</p>

<p>It is critical that no one touches the end of the swab.</p>

<h3>Extraction preparation</h3>

<p>The processing operative puts the extraction tube into a small cup and puts 6 drops of the extraction solution into the tube (without touching the edge of the tube).</p>

<h3>Swab handover</h3>

<p>The processing operative then takes the used swab from the person being tested.</p>

<p>The person being tested can move into the waiting area after they hand over the swab.</p>

<h3>Swab processing</h3>

<p>The swab is inserted head-first into the extraction tube.</p>

<p>Hold and press the swab head against the wall of the tube while rotating for about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Squeeze the lower end of the tube while removing the swab in order to remove as much liquid as possible from the swab.</p>

<h3>Swab extraction</h3>

<p>Place the swab into the plastic bag provided and dispose of it in the clinical waste bin.</p>

<h3>Prepare nozzle</h3>

<p>Press the nozzle cap tightly on to the tube.</p>

<h3>Rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device processing</h3>

<p>Squeeze 2 drops of the solution into the sample well of the LFD cartridge (marked with an âsâ).</p>

<p>Record the time of test (for example, âDrop at 11amâ) in marker pen on the LFD.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span> Results analysis</h2>

<h3>Results development</h3>

<p>Move the rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> device to an area where results will be processed and start the timer to track the development of the sample.</p>

<p>Results can be analysed after 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Read your results</h3>

<p>You will see the control line (C) begin to appear after about 4 minutes.</p>

<p>You must wait 30 minutes before your result is ready.</p>

<p>Do not leave the test to develop for longer than 30 minutes as this will make the result void.</p>

<p>One line next to C shows the test is negative.</p>

<p>Two lines, one next to C and one next to T even faint lines, shows the test is positive.</p>

<p>No lines or one line next to T shows the test is void.</p>

<p>If your test result is positive, you and your household must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">self-isolate following government guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>Marking results</h3>

<p>The test is then marked by a permanent marker and removed from the desk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mark with a plus (+) sign for positive tests</li>
  <li>mark with a V for invalid and void tests</li>
  <li>mark with a minus (-) sign for negative tests</li>

<h3>Creating a user profile</h3>

<p>When the person being tested is self-registering, they can select whether they would like to create an account or continue without an account.</p>

<p>Creating an account will take 2 minutes and save about 5 minutes on each future registration.</p>

<p>To create an account, the person being tested will need both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an email address</li>
  <li>a mobile phone number</li>
</ul>

<p>Once someone creates an account, it will remember their personal details and save time when it comes to each test result.</p>

<p>To set up the account, the person being tested should follow these steps:</p>

<h4>Enter email address</h4>

<p>This email will be used to set up an account, and the personal details will be linked to this email address.</p>

<p>This email must be the person being testedâs own individual email, and they will need to be able to access the email listed to confirm their user account set up. This email can be their own work email or a personal email address.</p>

<p>If the person being tested does not have their own email address, they cannot create an account at this time.</p>

<h3>Create a password</h3>

<p>Create a password for the account. It must have at least 8 characters and have 1 or more capital letters.</p>

<p>Enter the password again to confirm the password then select âContinueâ.</p>

<h3>Check email</h3>

<p>In a new browser window, navigate to the email inbox.</p>

<p>Open the email from <a href="mailto:noreply@login.nhs.uk" class="govuk-link">noreply@login.nhs.uk</a> and select âConfirm email addressâ.</p>

<p>Return to the NHS login screen. Select âI have confirmed my emailâ.</p>

<h3>Enter mobile number</h3>

<p>Enter the mobile number of the person being tested then select âContinueâ.</p>

<p>A security code will be sent to this number so they must be able to receive messages on the mobile number entered.</p>

<h3>Check mobile phone</h3>

<p>Enter the 6-digit security code sent to the mobile phone then select âContinueâ.</p>

<h3>Agree to share NHS login information</h3>

<p>To create an account, the person being tested will need to agree to share their NHS login information (email address and mobile number) with GOV.UK. To learn more about how the information is used, click on âPrivacy noticeâ and âTerms and conditionsâ.</p>

<p>To agree, select âContinueâ.</p>

<p>You have created your user profile.</p>

<p>For future registrations, people being tested again can enter the email they used to create their user account to login and save time.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Results guidance</h2>

<p>Once the result is logged, you can notify the person being tested and follow the associated guidance on their visit. Refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#results-image">results image</a> above if you need to check.</p>

<h3>Negative result</h3>

<p>The person being tested can continue with their visit if other <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures are adhered to.</p>

<p>If a person tests negative, it is likely that they were not infectious at the time the test was taken. A negative test result, however, is not a guarantee that they do not have coronavirus.</p>

<p>With a negative test, the person being tested must continue to follow national and local rules and guidelines including regular handwashing, social distancing and wearing face coverings, where required.</p>

<p>If a person tests negative, they must continue to wear appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, including a face mask, gloves and apron, and continue to follow <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in line with your adult social care serviceâs policy and in line with national policy. <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures remain important because the test is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific.</p>

<h3>Invalid or void result</h3>

<p>Re-test using another rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> kit to receive a conclusive result.</p>

<p>If available, consider using a rapid <abbr title="lateral flow test">LFT</abbr> from a different box.</p>

<h3>Positive result</h3>

<p>The person being tested can no longer proceed and requires a confirmatory <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test.</p>

<p>Provide the person being tested with a <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> test kit and ask them to test on site and then isolate at home immediately, avoiding public transport (if possible) and wearing a face mask.</p>

<p>Before the person being tested leaves, they will need to register the kit online using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/testing-for-coronavirus-at-home" class="govuk-link">testing yourself at home</a> instructions.</p>

<p>After registration is complete, you will need to schedule a courier to pick up the test kit.</p>
