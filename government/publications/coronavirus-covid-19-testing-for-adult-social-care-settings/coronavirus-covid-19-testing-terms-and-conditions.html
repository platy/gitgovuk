<p>The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care of 39 Victoria Street, Westminster, London, SW1H 0EU, United Kingdom (“<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>”) and social care providers in the United Kingdom are seeking to collaborate to combat the SARS-CoV2-19 (“COVID-19”) pandemic.</p>

<p>In these terms and conditions (the “<abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>”), “Provider” means the social care provider to which the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> have been provided to.
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and the Provider have agreed that <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will support the Provider to carry out and facilitate COVID-19 testing of individuals associated with the Provider, including the Provider’s staff, service users or visitors (and including visiting professionals who are not part of a regular testing programme) (“Test Subjects”).</p>

<p>The key objective of the Testing (as defined below) is to ensure the ongoing safety of the entire social care community. The Testing has the additional objective of seeking to ascertain how access to testing can support Test Subjects’ wellbeing alongside wider infection, prevention, and control measures, and feed into a holistic risk-based approach. Commencement of the Testing (including the ordering of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Supplies) by the Provider is deemed as acceptance of the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>.</p>

<p>For the purpose of Decision 2012/21/EU of the European Commission of 20 December 2011, the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> entrusts the Provider with the performance of public service obligations, which are set out in the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>.
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and the Provider have agreed to proceed with the Testing upon and subject to the following terms.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Term</h2>
<p>1.1 The agreement between the parties under the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> will begin on commencement of the supply by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> of <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Supplies (as defined below) and/or Testing under the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> (whichever is earlier) (“Commencement Date”).</p>

<p>1.2 The agreement shall continue from the Commencement Date for as long as the Provider continues to carry out the Testing (“Term”), at which point the agreement shall expire unless any extension is agreed in writing between the parties.</p>

<p>1.3 Any work such as training or preparation for the Testing by the parties prior to the Commencement Date shall be treated as having been performed under the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Standard operating procedure</h2>

<p>2.1 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has made available to the Provider a COVID-19 testing guidance document applicable to the Provider (“Guidance”), which sets out a detailed description and plan of the testing and ancillary responsibilities that are to be carried out by the Provider under the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>. The definition of “Guidance” shall include each of the documents and webpages which are linked to in the Guidance.</p>

<p>2.2 In these <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>:</p>

<p>2.2.1 “On-Site Guidance” shall mean all sections of the Guidance which are applicable to On-Site Testing; and</p>

<p>2.2.2 “Home Test Guidance” shall mean all sections of the Guidance which are applicable to Home Testing.</p>

<p>2.3 The Self-Test Kits are supplied with instructions for use (the latest version being the “Instructions for Use”) which the Provider must provide to Test Subjects where such kits are collected pursuant to these <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> may from time to time update the Instructions for Use.</p>

<p>2.4 Where Self-Test Kits are supplied with two sets of instructions for use, one from the original manufacturer and a second from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, the “Instructions for Use” for such Self-Test Kits shall be the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> instructions for use and the original manufacturer’s instructions for use must not be provided to a Test Subject.</p>

<p>2.5 The Provider agrees to (as applicable):</p>

<p>2.5.1 carry out or facilitate COVID-19 testing on Test Subjects on-site at the Provider (“On-Site Testing”); and</p>

<p>2.5.2 to operate a collection site to enable Test Subjects to collect Self-Test Kits (as defined below) from the Provider for COVID-19 testing (“Home Testing”), each in accordance with the applicable Guidance (together, the “Testing”).</p>

<p>2.6 <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> may update the Guidance during the Term from time to time and following such update will provide or make available a copy of the updated Guidance to the Provider. Unless otherwise agreed with <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> in writing, any updated Guidance and/or Instructions for Use shall apply from the date on which it is provided to the Provider.</p>

<p>2.7 If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> makes a change to the Guidance which would have a material adverse impact on the Provider, the Provider may request that <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> makes further changes to the Guidance to avoid or mitigate that impact.  If <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> does not make such further changes to the Guidance within 7 days, either party may immediately on written notice terminate the agreement.</p>

<p>2.8 In the event of conflict between the Guidance and the terms of the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr>, the terms of the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> shall prevail.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Primary responsibilities – testing</h2>

<p>3.1 Each Party agrees to perform the obligations that are allocated to it in the Guidance in accordance with the Guidance, the <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>3.2 This clause 3 shall apply to all Testing that is undertaken by the Provider. In addition, clause 4 shall apply to any On-Site Testing undertaken by the Provider and clause 5 shall apply to any Home Testing undertaken by the Provider.</p>

<p>3.3 In addition to clause 3.1, the Provider shall:</p>

<h3>Communication and set-up</h3>

<p>3.3.1 liaise with the appointed representative(s) of any stakeholders at or connected to the Provider in connection with the Testing;</p>

<p>3.3.7 on request provide <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> with appropriate evidence that each person has completed the training in clause 3.3.6;</p>

<p>3.3.8 provide such items as are necessary to carry out the Testing, except for any items which are to be provided by <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> as listed in the Guidance;</p>

<p>3.3.9 inspect the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> Supplies in accordance after delivery in accordance with clause 6.4.2;</p>

<p>3.3.18 provide such aggregated and anonymised data relating to Test Subjects as the parties may agree from time to time.</p>

<p>3.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Provider has the right to deny a potential Test Subject who is displaying symptoms of COVID-19 from participating in the Testing and shall instead direct the individual to the appropriate symptomatic guidelines and practices.</p>

<h3>Test kit log</h3>

<p>5.2 The Provider shall establish and maintain a test kit log  in accordance with the Guidance and requirements of these <abbr title="terms and conditions">T&amp;Cs</abbr> (“Test Kit Log”) (which may be comprised of a number of locally held documents where applicable).</p>
