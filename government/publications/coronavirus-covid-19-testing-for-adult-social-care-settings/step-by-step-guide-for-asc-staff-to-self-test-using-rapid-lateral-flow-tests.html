<p>This guide explains how to test yourself using a rapid lateral flow test for coronavirus (COVID-19), and report the results to the NHS.</p>

<p>See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/covid19-self-test-help">COVID-19 self-test help</a> page for further guidance including demonstration videos and instructions in other languages.</p>

<h2>Coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance and help</h2>

<p>If you have coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms or have contracted coronavirus (COVID-19), read the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-COVID-19" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) and your condition gets worse, or you do not get better after 7 days, use the <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">NHS 111 online coronavirus service</a>. If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.</p>

<p>Do not delay getting help if you are worried. Trust your instincts.</p>

<h2>About this test</h2>

<p>Many people with COVID-19 have mild, or even no symptoms, but can still spread the virus. With regular self- testing we can slow the spread and help protect the most vulnerable in our families and communities.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 self-test kit is a swab test (nose and throat) to check if you have coronavirus (COVID-19). You can use this self-test kit if you are asymptomatic (you do not have symptoms).</p>

<p>Each test will take about 15 minutes to set up and results will be ready after a further 30 minutes.</p>

<p>It’s very important you read the instructions and follow the steps in the correct order. You will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>prepare your test area and check your test kit contents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>set up your test</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>take your swab sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>process your swab sample</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>read your result</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>report your result</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>safely dispose of your test kit</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Store the test kit at room temperature or in a cool dry place (2°C to 30°C). Do not leave in direct sunlight and do not store in a fridge or freezer.</p>

<p>The kit should be used at room temperature (15°C to 30°C).</p>

<p>If the kit has been stored in a cool area (less than 15°C), leave it at normal room temperature for 30 minutes before using.</p>

<p>Keep the test kit away from children.</p>

<h2>General guidance and warnings</h2>

<p>You can only use each item in the test kit once.</p>

<p>Do not re-use the items.</p>

<p>You’ll need to report each person’s result.</p>

<p>If you have problems with your hands or vision, you may need someone to assist you with the swabbing and testing process.</p>

<p>If you have a nose piercing, swab the other nostril. If pierced on both sides, remove the piercing on one side before swabbing.</p>

<p>If you’ve had a nosebleed within the last 24 hours, swab the other nostril or wait 24 hours.</p>

<p>Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes before doing the test to reduce the risk of spoiling the test.</p>

<p>These kits are only designed for human use.</p>

<p>By carefully following these instructions, you will ensure a reliable result is achieved.</p>

<p>If there is a reason you cannot take a throat swab, for example you have a tracheostomy, instead swab both nostrils.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Prepare your test area and check your test kit contents</h2>

<p>You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a watch (or a clock)</li>
  <li>tissues</li>
  <li>a mirror</li>
  <li>hand sanitiser or soap and warm water</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not throw away the test strip until you have reported your test result.</p>

<p>1. Read this instruction guide carefully.</p>

<p>2. Clear, clean and dry a flat surface immediately before starting the test.</p>

<p>3. Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds, using soap and warm water, or hand sanitiser. This is so that you do not contaminate the test kit. Now dry your hands.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If doing more than one test, clean the surface and wash your hands again between each test</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Check the test kit contents.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure that nothing is damaged or broken. Do not use anything that is damaged or broken</li>
</ul>

<p>Your kit should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a test strip in sealed packaging</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a swab inside a sealed wrapper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>extraction solution sachets or bottle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>an extraction tube</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h4>If something is damaged, broken or missing</h4>

<p>If you notice anything damaged, broken, missing or difficult to use in the kit, do not use it.</p>

<p>If you wish to provide feedback on this please call the <a href="#customer-contact" class="govuk-link">customer contact centre</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been harmed or had a reaction using this kit, report it on the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/">coronavirus Yellow Card site</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Set up your test</h2>

<p>5. Take the test strip out of the sealed packaging and place it onto your cleaned flat surface. Once opened, start the test within 30 minutes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safely throw away the packaging in your household waste</li>
</ul>

<p>6. Place the extraction tube into a small cup (not provided).</p>

<p>7. Put exactly 6 drops of the extraction solution into the tube (without touching the edge of the tube).</p>

<p>8. Gently blow your nose into a tissue and throw the tissue away in a closed bin.</p>

<p>9. Wash your hands thoroughly again for 20 seconds using soap and warm water (or use sanitiser).</p>

<p>10. Feel the swab in the sealed wrapper in front of you and identify the soft, fabric tip of the swab.</p>

<p>11. When you are ready to do the test, peel open the swab packaging and gently take out the swab. You’ll use this swab for both your throat and nose.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Never touch the soft, fabric tip of the swab with your hands.</p>

<p>Do not touch the tongue, teeth, cheeks, gums, or any other surfaces with the fabric tip of the swab. If it touches anything else, it may spoil your sample.</p>

<p>Never touch the fabric strip with your hands.</p>

<p>Swabbing may feel uncomfortable, do not insert swab any deeper if there is strong resistance or pain.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Take your swab sample</h2>

<p>12. Holding the swab between your fingers, open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip of the swab over both tonsils (or where they would have been if you’ve had your tonsils removed).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do this with firm contact 4 times on each side (use a torch or a mirror to help you do this). Carefully remove the swab from the back of your throat</li>
</ul>

<p>13. Put the same swab gently into 1 nostril until you feel a slight resistance (about 2.5cm up your nose).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roll the swab firmly around the inside of the nostril, making 10 complete circles</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Process your swab sample</h2>

<p>14. Pick up the extraction tube and place the fabric tip of the swab into the extraction tube so it is in the liquid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Press the tip against the edge of the extraction tube with force, while rotating it around the extraction tube for 15 seconds. This is to transfer your sample into the liquid</li>
</ul>

<p>15. Pinch the extraction tube against the swab as you remove it. Make sure you remove all liquid from the soft tip of the swab.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the swab in the plastic waste bag provided</li>
</ul>

<p>16. Press the cap tightly on to the extraction tube to avoid any leaks.</p>

<p>17. Gently squeeze the extraction tube to place 2 drops of the liquid onto the sample well on the test strip (marked with an ‘s’).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you place the test strip on a flat and level surface. Do not move the strip during the test</li>
  <li>Make sure that you are dropping liquid and not an air bubble</li>
  <li>Put the extraction tube in the plastic waste bag along with the swab</li>
</ul>

<p>18. Check the time and set a timer if you have one. Wait 30 minutes before you read your result.</p>

<p>Waiting the full 30-minute development time before you read your result is very important. A positive result can appear at any time after 20 minutes, however you must wait for the full 30 minutes to record a negative result as the test line (T) may take this long to appear. If a positive signal appears after 30 minutes, it should not be reported as positive.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Read your result</h2>

<p>You will see the control line (C) begin to appear after about 4 minutes. You must wait 30 minutes before your result is ready.</p>

<p>Do not leave the test to develop for longer than 30 minutes as this will make the result void.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>You must report all results to the NHS – negative, positive and void.</p>
</div>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/119266/LatFlow-960x640.png" alt=""></div></figure>

<h3>Negative result</h3>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>One line next to C shows the test is negative.</p>
</div>

<p>If there is a coloured smudge, this should be interpreted as a negative result.</p>

<p>If you get a negative result, it is likely that you were not infectious at the time the test was taken. A negative test result, however, is not a guarantee that you do not have coronavirus.</p>

<p>You must report this test result to the NHS.</p>

<p>If you test negative, you must continue to follow national and local rules and guidelines including regular handwashing, social distancing and wearing face coverings, where required.</p>

<p>If you test negative, you must continue to wear appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, including a face mask, gloves and apron, and continue to follow <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures in line with your agency’s policy and in line with national policy. <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures remain important because the test is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific.</p>

<h3>Positive result</h3>

<div aria-label="Warning" role="note" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>Two lines, one next to C and one next to T, even faint lines, show the test is positive.</p>
</div>

<p>The positive line may be weak. You should hold the test strip up to the light and examine closely to feel confident of the result.</p>

<p>If you get a positive result, it means you are currently likely infected with coronavirus and risk infecting others.</p>

<p>You must report this test result to the NHS. When you report your result, you will be provided with further information on the next steps to take.</p>

<p>Please note, your results will be identified as a rapid lateral flow test result on the test message you will receive.</p>

<p>You must also report this test result immediately to your manager.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If your test result is positive, you and your household must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">self-isolate following government guidelines</a>. You must not continue working.</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of a positive rapid lateral flow test result, you will need to complete a PCR test to confirm the positive result. You must self-isolate while awaiting the results of this confirmatory PCR test. You may have been provided with a PCR test to use in case of a positive result. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">order a PCR test online</a>.</p>

<h3>Void result</h3>

<div role="note" aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>No lines or one line next to T means the test is void.</p>
</div>

<p>If you receive a void result, you should continue to work as normal and undertake another rapid lateral flow test on the next day.</p>

<p>You must report this void result to the NHS.</p>

<h3>Results variation</h3>

<p>Results may not be always be clear-cut. Result lines may appear smudged or faint, but they are still valid results and must be reported. You can refer to these images to support you in feeling confident of your result.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Report your result</h2>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>You must report your results to the NHS within 24 hours of testing.</p>
</div>

<p>Report your result so the NHS can monitor the spread of the virus, support communities across the UK, combat the virus and save lives. You can also find out more about the result and what you need to do.</p>

<p>You need the QR code, or the ID number under it, on the test strip to report your result.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">Report online (fastest)</a></h3>

<h3>Or report by telephone</h3>

<p>Call 119 (free for all mobiles and landlines)</p>

<p>Lines are open every day, 7am to 11pm.</p>

<p>Make a note of your test results. This is for your own records. You must still report your result to the NHS.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Safely dispose of your test kit</h2>

<p>Once your test is complete, put all of the used test kit contents in your general household waste.</p>

<h2>Additional guidance for managers</h2>

<p>Social care managers are responsible for making sure that all their staff are following the guidance in this step-by-step guide for self-testing.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Before you distribute any rapid lateral flow self-test kits to staff, read this guidance in its entirety. Make sure you understand what is expected of staff with regard to self-testing Make sure you have set up systems to share your unique UON with staff, track kit distribution, staff training, and staff results</p>
</div>

<h3>Tracking kit distribution</h3>

<p>The organisation distributing test kits is obliged to keep a detailed record of any test kits provided for use at home or outside the organisation. In the unlikely event of any issues with a batch of test kits, organisations will be required to track the location of tests kits. In order to do this the details below should be recorded and stored.</p>

<ul>
  <li>first name, last name, telephone number and/or email address of test subject</li>
  <li>details of lot and batch number</li>
  <li>date of issue to user</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The boxes of rapid lateral flow test kits should not be split up. Each member of staff should be given a complete box.</p>
</div>

<h3>Tracking staff results</h3>

<p>When staff complete rapid lateral flow self-tests, managers will not automatically receive a copy of staff results by email or text. Managers must request this information from their staff directly. Make sure you have set up a system for staff to share their test results with you.</p>

<p>Once you have set up a system for results to be shared, make sure all staff are aware of the expectations for sharing their results before the first day of self-testing.</p>

<p>Any staff member who reports a positive rapid lateral flow test result should self-isolate immediately and complete a PCR test to confirm the positive result. Staff with a positive result should not come to work. You should distribute a confirmatory PCR test to staff with their rapid lateral flow test boxes. If they do not have a PCR test available at home, they should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test" class="govuk-link">order a PCR test online</a>.</p>
