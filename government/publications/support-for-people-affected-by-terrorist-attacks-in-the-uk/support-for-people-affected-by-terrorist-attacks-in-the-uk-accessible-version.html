<p>This leaflet contains information on where to seek advice and assistance following a terrorist attack in the UK. Further detail is available on the website <a class="govuk-link" href="https://victimsofterrorism.campaign.gov.uk" rel="external">victimsofterrorism.campaign.gov.uk</a>, which is updated regularly.</p>

<h2>Emotional and practical support</h2>

<h3>Victim Support</h3>

<p>Victim Support operates a 24/7 confidential support line, offering specialist support for anyone who has been affected by terrorist attacks. Victim Support can provide immediate and longer term support through their local services, which can be accessed at any time after the attack.</p>

<p>If you are bereaved through murder or manslaughter and you are an immediate family member of the deceased or you were a witness to the murder or manslaughter, Victim Support can help you through the Homicide Service.</p>

<p>You can contact the Homicide Service yourself or you can be referred by an agency or the police (for example through your Family Liaison Officer).</p>

<p>For further information go to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.victimsupport.org.uk" rel="external">victimsupport.org.uk</a>, or call them for free on 0808 168 9111. You can also access the Homicide Service on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:HSsupport@victimsupport.org.uk">HSsupport@victimsupport.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Cruse Bereavement Support</h3>

<p>If you are not eligible for support from the Homicide Service above, Cruse Bereavement Support may be able to provide bereavement support. The service is available throughout the UK, with referrals to their sister organisation Cruse Scotland, where applicable. Cruse can be contacted via their helpline on 0808 808 1677 or their website at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cruse.org.uk" rel="external">www.cruse.org.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>Samaritans</h3>

<p>Samaritans offer emotional support and a safe place to talk at any time. The number is 116 123 and is free to call from any phone or you can email <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Mental health support</h2>

<p>Having an emotional reaction to a major incident like a terrorist attack is normal and people may experience a range of emotions that can vary in severity. What is important is to recognise that these are normal responses to making sense of major events. While they can be incredibly distressing, many of these feelings are likely to reduce over time.</p>

<p>If your experiences and feelings are severe, or last for longer than 4 weeks, you may require more support. There are treatments available through the NHS to help people deal with the effects of very distressing events. Please visit your GP who will be able to provide advice. You can also call 111 for non-emergency medical advice.</p>

<p>The NHS have a leaflet with information on how you may expect to feel in the days and months ahead, and how you can understand and have more control over your experience. Read <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/617321/nhs_trauma_leaflet.pdf" rel="external">‘Coping with stress following a major incident’</a> on the NHS website.</p>

<h3>South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM)</h3>

<p>The Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT) at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) has been commissioned by the Home Office to provide clinical mental health support, specifically for those affected by terrorism. Support can be provided at any time after an attack, for anyone across the UK.
SLAM can also refer those affected to local or specialist psychological support services, where required.</p>

<p>You can contact the clinic directly on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:survivorsofterrorism@slam.nhs.uk">survivorsofterrorism@slam.nhs.uk</a> or by telephone on 0800 0902371.</p>

<h3>Regional services</h3>

<p>If you live in England you can contact your local ‘improving access to psychological therapies’ (IAPT) service to be assessed for NHS psychological treatment. Find information on your local IAPT services by visiting <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/" rel="external">nhs.uk</a></p>

<p>If you have been affected by a terrorist attack in London, the London Victim and Witness Service led by Victim Support is available for you. You can access help and support by calling the support line on 0808 168 9111. More information on the service can be found on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://londonvws.org.uk/" rel="external">London Victim and Witness Service website</a>.</p>

<p>If you live in Northern Ireland and you’re in need of psychological support after witnessing an attack you should make urgent contact with your GP. If you or someone you know appears to be in mental health crisis, you should immediately contact Lifeline on 0808 808 8000.</p>

<p>If you are in Scotland, Breathing Space offers free and confidential advice for people experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety, whatever the cause. They can be contacted on 0800 83 85 87.</p>

<p>The Wales Terrorist Attack Support Helpline provides a confidential listening, emotional support and signposting service. Freephone 0800 107 0900 or text the word ‘help’ to 81066.</p>

<h2>Support for children</h2>

<p>Childline have an online resource that offers information and tips on dealing with any fears children might have about a terrorist incident. You can find this on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.childline.org.uk/get-support/ask-sam/your-feelings-asksam/terror-attack-worry/" rel="external">Childline website</a>. Children can also get support from a counsellor by calling 0800 1111.</p>

<h2>Charitable funds</h2>

<p>Following a terrorist attack in the UK, charitable funds may be raised to help people who have been affected. Each attack is different. Details of any funds will emerge over the days and weeks following an attack, and these will be shared on the victims of terrorism website, given at the front of this leaflet.</p>

<h2>Compensation</h2>

<p>Anyone who has been directly affected by a terrorist incident can find out about applying for compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) helpline on 0300 003 3601. You can also search on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-compensation-criminal-injury">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>You can request support in applying to the scheme through your local police and crime commissioner. Contact details are available from the Victims Information Service on 0808 168 9293.</p>

<h2>Foreign nationals in the UK</h2>

<p>Foreign nationals in the UK affected by an incident may wish to contact their embassy, high commission or consulate, who may also be able to provide information or assistance. Search <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk">GOV.UK</a> to find a list of embassies and their contact details.</p>

<h2>Dealing with attention from the media</h2>

<p>After a terrorist incident, the media may be interested in speaking to you. Sometimes, communicating with the media in a controlled way can be a positive experience. But you do not have to talk to the press if you don’t want to.</p>

<p>Many UK newspapers are members of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), which means they must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit. You can contact IPSO on 0300 123 22 20. There is more advice on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://victimsofterrorism.campaign.gov.uk" rel="external">victims of terrorism website</a>, given at the front of this leaflet.</p>

<h2>Longer-term peer support</h2>

<p>The Peace Foundation manages a peer-to-peer support network for those affected by terrorism, bringing survivors together to share their experiences and support one another. The service is free and confidential and available to all people in the UK who have experienced terrorism at home or abroad.</p>

<p>You can contact the Peace Foundation by email at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:support@peace-foundation.org.uk">support@peace-foundation.org.uk</a>, phone 01925 581240, or visit the website at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.peace-foundation.org.uk" rel="external">www.peace-foundation.org.uk</a>.</p>
