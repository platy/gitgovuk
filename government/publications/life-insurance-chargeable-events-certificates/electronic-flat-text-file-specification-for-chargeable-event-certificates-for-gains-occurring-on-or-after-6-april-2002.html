<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>Insurers are required to deliver certificates under section 552 Income and Corporation Taxes Act (<abbr title="Income and Corporation Taxes Act">ICTA</abbr>) 1988 (as inserted by Schedule 28 Finance Act 2001).</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to describe the standard format in which insurers should deliver these Chargeable Event Certificates to HMRC for chargeable events occurring on or after 6 April 2002.</p>

<p>All statutory references are to the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 unless otherwise stated.  More guidance on the type of events can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/insurance-premium-tax">Insurance Policyholder Taxation Manual (<abbr title="Insurance Policyholder Taxation Manual">IPTM</abbr>)</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Reportable requirements</h3>

<p>Insurers must supply details of all chargeable event gains where the value of the gain, aggregated where relevant with all gains connected with it, is more than half the ‘basic rate limit’ for the relevant year of assessment.  The ‘basic rate limit’ is defined in subsections 1(2) (b) and 1(3) <abbr title="Income and Corporation Taxes Act">ICTA</abbr> 1988.</p>

<p>Insurers must also supply details to HMRC for all whole assignments for money or money’s worth (whatever the value of the gain), unless they are satisfied that no gain is to be treated as arising by reason of the assignment.</p>

<p>For gains whose value, when aggregated with connected gains, if any, exceeds half the basic rate limit, insurers may report them either on paper in the prescribed form or in a form that meets the standard specification.</p>

<p>For yearly gains on Personal Portfolio Bonds (as defined section 515), the reporting rules apply to gains that are treated as arising on or after 6 April 2002.</p>

<p>A gain is connected with another gain in accordance with section 552(8) if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the insurer and policyholder are the same</li>
  <li>both gains are attributable to the same year of assessment or, for corporate policyholders, the same financial year</li>
  <li>the terms of the policies or contracts are the same apart from any difference in their maturity dates</li>
  <li>the policies or contracts were made on the same date</li>
</ul>

<p>For policyholders that are individuals or trustees, the relevant year of assessment for a gain treated as arising by virtue of section 498 is the year of assessment which includes the end of the ‘year’ (as defined section 499) in which the part surrender or part assignment took place. In any other case, the relevant year of assessment is the year of assessment in which the chargeable event occurred or, for yearly gains on Personal Portfolio Bonds, in which the gain is treated as arising.</p>

<p>For policyholders that are companies and where the event occurred prior to the accounting period ending 31 March 2008 only, the relevant year of assessment is the year of assessment that includes the end of the financial year which includes the end of the ‘year’ (as defined in section 499) in which the part surrender or part assignment took place. In any other case, it is the year of assessment that includes the end of the financial year in which the chargeable event occurred or, for yearly gains on Personal Portfolio Bonds, in which the gain is treated as arising.</p>

<p>An insurer may also deliver certificates to HMRC for all gains treated as arising on the happening of chargeable events on or after 6 April 2002 (or the yearly gain on a Personal Portfolio Bond treated as arising on or after that date), whatever their amount, in a form that meets the standard specification (for example, not on paper).</p>

<p>Insurers must give information for the suitable policyholder, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policy number</li>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>forenames</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>full address including postcode</li>
  <li>category of chargeable event</li>
  <li>date of event</li>
  <li>number of years</li>
  <li>number of policyholders</li>
  <li>whether Income Tax treated as paid on the gain</li>
  <li>insurer name and ID</li>
  <li>currency used to complete the certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the event is a chargeable event by virtue of section 498, the date in which the ‘year’ (as defined section 499) in which the event took place ends.</p>

<p>Where the event is anything other than a whole assignment, the amount of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the gain</li>
  <li>Income Tax treated as paid</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the event is a whole assignment for money or money’s worth, the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>amount of relevant capital payments</li>
  <li>amount of premiums or consideration</li>
  <li>value of parts previously assigned</li>
  <li>amount of total previous gains</li>
  <li>capital element paid on account of annuity</li>
</ul>

<p>All monetary amounts should be reported by insurers in whole pounds. For example, £1,000.45 could be reported as 1000 or 1001 depending whether it is to the advantage of the individual taxpayer to round up or down.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Insurers unable to meet standard specification</h3>

<p>If an insurer is unable to meet the standard specification then submission of Chargeable Event Certificate data sent electronically will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Time limit for delivery of certificates</h3>

<p>Insurers are required to deliver Chargeable Event Certificates to HMRC before the end of the relevant 3 month period. The relevant period is whichever ends the latest out of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the period of 3 months following the end of the year of assessment in which the event happened or, if the policyholder is a company, the period of 3 months following the end of the financial year in which the event happened</li>
  <li>the period of 3 months following the end of the year (as defined in section 499) in which the event happened (if the event is a surrender or assignment of a part that is a chargeable event by virtue of section 498)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the event is a death or an assignment in whole or in part, under section 552(7)(c) <abbr title="Income and Corporation Taxes Act">ICTA</abbr> 88, where an insurer receives written notification of a death or assignment they must report the relevant chargeable event details to HMRC within 3 months of receiving this notification.  Where this notification is received outside of the tax year in which the date of event occurs, this can cause administrative difficulties for insurers who then need to submit several extra batches of certificates, either on paper or magnetic media, to HMRC during the year in order to meet the time limits.</p>

<p>These difficulties can also apply where there is an event giving rise to a gain which only has to be reported to HMRC owing to the existence of a connected gain arising by virtue of a death or assignment. The time limit for reporting the former gain would be the same as that for reporting the connected gain that first alerts the insurer to the fact that the aggregate of connected gains exceeds the half basic rate threshold (for example, 3 months after the insurer receives written notification of the death or assignment).</p>

<p>With the aim of encouraging insurers to submit information on an annual basis, where an insurer reports chargeable event details on a death or assignment to HMRC within 3 months of the end of the tax year in which the insurer received written notification of the event, HMRC will now accept this as meeting the reporting requirement. This time limit will also apply to certificates issued in the exceptional circumstances described in section 552(7)(d), where the issue of a certificate is only required because of the happening of another event.  Then the insurer may report details to HMRC within 3 months of the end of the tax year in which it receives notification of that other event. Provided an insurer has issued the certificate to HMRC within this period, HMRC will not seek a penalty even though the certificate may not have been issued in strict accordance with the statutory time limit in section 552(7)(c).</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>There is a part-surrender on 1 October 2006 and the policy year ends on 31 May 2007. The first bullet applies.  The event is deemed to occur at the end of the policy ‘year’ for example, on 31 May 2007, which falls in the year of assessment (or ‘tax year’) ending on 5 April 2008. The insurer would then have until 5 July 2008 to report the gain to HMRC.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>There is a part assignment on 1 September 2006 giving rise to a gain and the policy year ends on 30 April 2007.  Then, the insurer does not need to report the gain to HMRC until 5 July 2008. The second bullet would apply and the tax year, in which the ‘year’ in which the event is treated as happening ends, is 2007 to 2008.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Where a death on 1 March 2006 was reported to the insurer on 1 September 2006 the third bullet above would apply. The insurer would therefore have until 5 July 2007 to report the gain to HMRC even though the tax year in which the event happened is 2005 to 2006.</p>

<p>Continuing this example, if the gain on the death was only £10,000, but there was also a £10,000 gain on a part assignment in tax year 2005 to 2006, the third bullet would apply and the insurer would have until the same date — 5 July 2007 — to report to HMRC not only the gain on death but also the gain on the part assignment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Glossary</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Insurer</h3>

<p>The life insurer resident, or with a branch, in the UK who will be responsible for the management of the process for delivering batches of certificates. This is normally the body by or with whom the policy or contract was issued, entered into or effected. But where the obligations of the body that issued, entered into or effected the policy or contract have been transferred to another insurer to whom there has been a transfer of the whole or any part of a business, the insurer responsible for delivering batches of certificates in respect of chargeable events arising after date of the transfer, or in the case of death or assignment first notified after the date of the transfer, will be the transferee.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Report of Chargeable Event Certificates</h3>

<p>A report of Chargeable Event Certificates will consist of one or more sub-reports.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Sub-report of Chargeable Event Certificates</h3>

<p>Chargeable Event Certificates will be provided to HMRC by the insurer in one or more sub-reports. All references are automatically opened with the default sub-report number 01. In some cases additional sub-reports may be required where an insurer needs to divide the batches of certificates:</p>

<p>If you need an additional sub-report number this must be agreed with HMRC by emailing your requirements to <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk">da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Typical reasons for requiring additional sub-report numbers are the insurer may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be supplying the batch of certificates either on different media or from different systems</li>
  <li>have a regional system and is unable to collate this information onto one report, the sub-report is identified by the ‘/99’ suffix to the insurer reference and relates to a specific insurer system/region/media combination</li>
</ul>

<p>An insurer may be notified of a death or assignment of the whole or a part of the policy more than 3 months after the end of the tax year in which the death or assignment occurred. In such circumstances, it will clearly not be possible for the insurer to report the gain arising on the death or assignment at the same time as it reports the other gains for the tax year in which the death or assignment occurred.</p>

<p>The insurer should keep reports of such gains separate from reports of gains arising in a later tax year for example, on a separate file.  If an insurer decides to report these gains electronically rather than on paper, it should treat the report as a supplementary sub-report for the year to which the gains relate using the appropriate sequential batch number.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Batches of Chargeable Event Certificates</h3>

<p>There is a limit of one gigabyte of data that can be read and processed at a time. For this reason where a sub-report exceeds this limit, insurers are required to divide their sub-report into a number of reproducible batches.
Each chargeable event sub-report consists of one or more batches of up to one gigabyte each. A sub-report which is greater than one gigabyte is required to be split into batches. A sub-report which is less than one gigabyte may be submitted in one batch. Batches are sequentially numbered (within each sub-report) to enable the batch to be re-produced and duplicate batches avoided. The batches can be provided at any time (at the insurers discretion) within the legislatively defined time frame.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Encryption</h3>

<p>You can get advice on security and encryption by sending an email to: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk">da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Allowable character sets</h3>

<p>Reports can be accepted in either upper or lower case characters. All data must be encoded in ASCII or UTF8 (multibyte) character sets. Advice on allowable character sets can be found at Appendix C within this guide.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Use of multibytes</h3>

<p>Financial institutions may need to use characters other than upper and lower case A to Z in their databases. These may then appear in returns.</p>

<p>In UTF8, accented characters such as é and umlauted characters such as ü are stored as multiple bytes of data. They are multibyte characters, which should count as a single character for creating your return.</p>

<p>The rule about counting characters and not bytes applies to all types of encoding.</p>

<p>If you use UTF8 when compiling your return, you must count multibyte characters as a single character. This is to avoid your return failing processing and a resubmission request.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.8 </span> Structured names</h3>

<p>This refers to the holding of names in a structured format such as, the title, initials or forenames and surname components are held separately in named fields.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Policyholder title: Mr<br>
Policyholder forenames/initials: Frank A<br>
Policyholder surname: Bloggs</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.9 </span> Unstructured names</h3>

<p>This refers to the holding of names in an unstructured format such as, all of the name details are presented together in a single free text field.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Policyholder name: ‘Mr Frank A Bloggs’</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Report format</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> Record types</h3>

<p>Four record types are required within each batch making up the chargeable event report:</p>

<h4>Type 1</h4>

<p>Identifies the insurer (or branch) delivering the certificates. It also asks you to define the length of some of the fields in the type 2 and type 3 records.</p>

<h4>Type 2</h4>

<p>Identifies the financial details for each chargeable event gain being reported.</p>

<h4>Type 3</h4>

<p>Identifies the personal details of the policyholders to each reported event.</p>

<h4>Type 4</h4>

<p>Gives the count of all the type 2 records (chargeable events).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Type 1 record — insurer information</h3>

<p>Batches are required to be reproducible by the insurer.</p>

<p>Each batch must start with a type 1 record that defines the parameters for the batch, including the details of the insurer submitting the batch of certificates.</p>

<p>The type 1 record contains dynamic field definitions used to define the length of character data items within the type 2 and type 3 records which follow to cater for the differing field sizes and formats that may be received from different insurers. A single definition is permitted for each field which will apply to all instances of the data item within the type 2 and 3 records following the type 1 record.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>If 5 address lines of 20 characters have been defined for the policyholder information within the type 1 record, wherever an address is defined within the type 3 record a field of 100 characters will be expected and will be interpreted as consisting of 5 lines of 20 characters. Any addresses or lines which are shorter than the defined length will be padded out to the defined size with space characters.</p>

<p>Where a type 2 or type 3 record field is defined with a length of 0 (zero) in the type 1 record, the field does not actually appear in the reported record.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this document, fields which are defined dynamically, that is, defined according to your own requirements and needs are specified as having a format of CHAR X.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Type 2 record — chargeable event gain information</h3>

<p>One or more type 2 records will follow each type 1 record. This record will have details of the chargeable event gain.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Type 3 record — policyholder information</h3>

<p>One or more type 3 records must follow each type 2 record. There must be a type 3 record for each person party to the policy or contract.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span> Type 4 record</h3>

<p>A single type 4 record follows the last type 3 record in each batch. The type 4 record contains a count of the number of chargeable events reported in the batch (for example, a count of type 2 records).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span> Record structure details</h3>

<h4>Field type C</h4>

<p>Conditional fields. These fields must be completed where the conditions stated are met, otherwise pad with spaces.</p>

<h4>Field type M</h4>

<p>Mandatory fields. These fields must be completed using one of the values described.</p>

<h4>Field type O</h4>

<p>Non-mandatory fields. These should be completed where possible, otherwise pad with spaces.</p>

<p>Some of the fields specified in the type 1 record are used by the insurer to define the sizes of the fields following in the type 2 and type 3 records. The insurer is allowed to set some of these to zero lengths. These fields have been categorised as mandatory on the type 1 record because they must be supplied even though their contents may be set to zero.</p>

<p>In instances where the insurer has defined these field sizes to be zero, HMRC will not expect these fields to be present in the type 2 or type 3 records as appropriate.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span> Format definition</h3>

<p>Wherever a ‘format’ instruction appears, followed by some alphabetic or numeric characters, it is intended to give guidance on the acceptable input to that particular field.</p>

<p>For example, ‘format A9999’ should be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>A — any alphabetic character, unless stated specifically<br>
9 — any digit from 0 to 9, unless stated specifically<br></p>

<p>For example, ‘format DDMMCCYY’ should be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p>DD — a numeric representation of a date within a month<br>
MM — a numeric representation of a month within a year<br>
CC — a numeric representation of a century<br>
YY —  a numeric representation of a year within a century<br></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span> If your data does not fill the entire field</h3>

<p>When padding a field with spaces, each character must be filled with a space character. For example, where the forename field is 40 characters. If the forename is Stephen (7 characters), the remaining 33 positions to the right are filled with space characters as described.</p>

<p>For UTF-8 coding, a space is the character with the decimal code 32.</p>

<p>Some fields should be right justified and some left justified, the information in the table in section 3.9.1 say which. Where a field is left justified you start from the left with data and pad the remaining characters to the right with spaces. For right justified, the characters to the left are padded with spaces.</p>

<p>Do not use tab characters (UTF-8 code 9). The tab is a single character that represents the number of spaces to the next tab stop on a printer, typewriter or text editor. So, it does not represent any particular number of spaces in other contexts, such as Bank, Building Society Interest returns.</p>

<span class="number">4. </span> Guidelines for acceptable media</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span> Media submissions are no longer accepted.</h3>

<h4>4.1.1 Format</h4>

<p>Files must be encoded in UTF-8 as per ISO 20022 (ASCII), unless you’re using the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-of-chargeable-event-gains-life-insurance-policies">HMRC chargeable events spreadsheet</a> from GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>4.1.2 Content</h4>

<p>The content of the file should conform to the chargeable event report format as defined in the electronic flat text file specification unless you are using the latest version of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-of-chargeable-event-gains-life-insurance-policies">HMRC chargeable events spreadsheet</a> from GOV.UK.</p>

<h4>4.1.3 Naming</h4>

<p>You should label all files you send whether by <abbr title="Secure Data Exchange Service">SDES</abbr> or email where the event occurred in the same tax year in the format: HMRC Ref_Sub number_Batch number_Total number of batches_Year</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>All 5 items are required to allow us to process the file correctly.</p>

<p>Each file needs its own name so that we can identify it. Do not zip files together or in groups. Without the correct information we will not be able to process the data.</p>

<p>To avoid the return being rejected or queried you must always use the above file naming convention. For example, if a financial institution with the HMRC reference C9876/03 sends in two batches for 2018, the files (batches) would be labelled:</p>

<p>In the light of the Information Commissioners recent advice, we encourage everyone to be this careful when transferring information to us. We do not set any particular security standards for data coming to us from businesses but are happy to work with anyone who needs to send us data to help secure it. Under the Data Protection Act you are responsible for the security of personal data until we have received it.</p>

<h2>Appendix C — allowable character sets</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> Data content</h2>

<p>All data must be encoded in ASCII or UTF8 (multibyte) character sets.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span> Allowable character set</h2>

<p>Data must use the same character set.</p>

<p>Only the following characters are allowable:</p>

<p>Upper case alphabet A to Z<br>
Lower case alphabet a to z<br>
Numbers	 0 to 9<br>
Oblique	 /<br>
Hyphen	-<br>
Ampersand	&amp;<br>
Full stop		.<br>
Apostrophe		‘<br>
Comma		,<br>
Left hand parenthesis	(<br>
Right hand parenthesis	)<br>
Space<br></p>

<p>Numeric data must be expressed as digits and as printable characters, for example, number 12 should be expressed as character 1 and character 2.</p>

<p>Where fractions of numbers are being reported, these should be expressed in decimal and as printable characters, for example, 1.25 should be expressed as character 1, character ., character 2 and character 5.</p>

<p>It is vital that the following characters are not supplied:</p>

<p>Asterisk	 *<br>
Semi-colon ;<br>
Vertical bar	|<br></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Use of multibytes (foreign characters)</h3>
<p>In UTF8, accented characters such as é and umlauted characters such as ü are stored as multiple bytes of data. They are multibyte characters, which should count as a single character for creating your return.</p>

<p>The rule about counting characters and not bytes applies to all types of encoding.</p>

<p>If you use UTF8 when compiling your return, you must count multibyte characters as a single character. This is to avoid your return failing processing and a resubmission request.</p>

<h2>Appendix D — naming conventions</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is applicable only to those fields where names are supplied as free format text (unstructured).</p>

<h4>Why you need to give a naming convention code</h4>

<p>HMRC need to determine for entries in a free format field the order of the elements in the name, so that during processing HMRC can interpret the data and utilise it effectively.</p>

<h4>Which code you should use</h4>

<p>This should be indicated by the 2 digit numerical code that matches your data. The acceptable code numbers are shown in paragraphs 9.1 and 9.2.</p>

<h4>Type 3 record — policyholder naming convention</h4>

<p>Where no policyholder name or title has been supplied enter the code 00 (numeric zero’s) in the account naming convention field.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Notes on policyholder information</h3>

<p>If relevant, insurers must supply information for the suitable policyholder including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>forenames</li>
  <li>surname</li>
  <li>full address including postcode</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Structured name set to ‘Y’</h3>

<p>The insurer holds the policyholder’s name for this chargeable event in a structured format. Supply ‘00’ in naming convention field.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Structured name set to ‘N’</h3>

<p>The insurer holds the name of the policyholder in an unstructured format. The full name will be supplied in the policyholder name field. The naming convention field is used to determine how HMRC will interpret the free format name supplied in the policyholder name field.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Naming convention</h3>

<p>This will be set to the following, depending on how the name will be supplied:</p>

<p>00<br>
the policyholder name is provided in a structured format in the title, initial or forename and surname fields</p>

<p>01<br>
title(s) forename(s) surname for example, Mr John Adam Smith</p>

<p>02<br>
surname forename(s) title(s) for example, Smith John Adam Mr</p>

<p>03<br>
surname title(s) forename(s) for example, Smith Mr John Adam</p>

<p>04<br>
forename(s) surname for example, John Adam Smith</p>

<p>05<br>
surname forename(s) for example, Smith John Adam</p>

<p>06<br>
title(s) surname forename(s) for example, Mr Smith John Adam</p>

<p>Forenames may contain initials or may not even be present — if the format is indeterminate, then supply ‘01’.</p>

<h2>Appendix E — guidance on completion</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span> Type 1 record</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.1 </span> HMRC insurer reference</h3>

<p>The prefix is the number provided to the insurer by HMRC for the purposes of submitting Chargeable Event Certificates and is the format A9999. The ‘/99’ is the sub report number (‘01’ to ‘99’) to enable the insurer to report from different systems or reports from regional based systems. If an insurer only requires one value, then the automatic default setting is ‘/01’. If additional numbers are required follow instructions at paragraph 2.3.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.2 </span> Insurer name</h3>

<p>This is the name of the insurer submitting the report.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">9.3 </span> Batch number</h3>

<p>This is a sequential number generated by the insurer. The number sequence is specific to each insurer reporting system (denoted by the HMRC insurer reference and sub-report number) and allows unique identification for the batch.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span> Type 2 record</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.1 </span> Policy number</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. It is the unique identifying designation given by the insurer to the policy or contract. Insurers may aggregate the details from more than one policy where the nature and date of the event are the same in respect of each policy and where the policy numbers are the same apart from a sub-designation for example, the whole surrender of 6 policies AB1234567/1, AB1234567/2 and so on, could be included on 6 individual certificates or all amounts could be amalgamated and shown on one certificate with the policy number shown as AB1234567/1-6.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.2 </span> Currency code</h3>

<p>The 3-character field is for the <abbr title="Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication">SWIFT</abbr> code of the currency in which the insurer reports details of all monetary amounts. The default setting is the currency of the UK. Insurers may space fill the field if the certificate is completed in the currency of the UK.</p>

<p>The insurer may complete the certificate using the currency in which the policy is denominated if this is not the currency of the UK. In this case the insurer must complete the field with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html" rel="external">appropriate <abbr title="Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication">SWIFT</abbr> code</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.3 </span> Chargeable event type</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. The entry should be a number to denote the category of event, set out as follows:</p>

<p>1 — Death.<br>
2 — Maturity.<br>
3 — Surrender including fundamental reconstructions of the contract, such as change of life or lives assured.<br>
4 — Whole assignment for money or money’s worth.<br>
5 — Part surrender to which section 498 applies — see the following table.<br>
6 — Part surrender to which section 509 applies — see the following table.<br>
7 — Part assignment for money or money’s worth.<br>
8 — Yearly gain on personal portfolio bond.</p>

<p>Policy loans within section 548 are treated as if they were part surrenders. Insurers should report loans which are chargeable events as category of event 5 or 6 as appropriate, applying the rules, which are set out in the following table, to the loans as if they were part surrenders.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.4 </span> Date of chargeable event</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. The entry here is the date on which the event occurred. This is generally the date on which the transaction giving rise to the event took place. If more than one part surrender is reported on the same certificate under section 552ZA (3), insurers should report the date of one of the part surrenders which it is reporting.</p>

<p>The exceptions to this are when the event is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a part surrender with neither a part assignment for money or money’s worth during the year, nor a later part or whole assignment otherwise than for money or money’s worth later in the year (category of event number 5)</li>
  <li>the occurrence of a yearly gain on a personal portfolio bond (category of event number 8) — in these cases the date of the event is the last day of the year as defined in section 499</li>
</ul>

<p>The date should be included in the format DDMMCCYY.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.5 </span> Date on which policy year ends (defined in section 499)</h3>

<p>An entry is needed here when the event is either a part surrender falling within category of event number 6 (see table in section 10.3) or a part assignment for money or money’s worth (category of event number 7).</p>

<p>In these cases, in addition to reporting the date of the event, the insurer must enter in this field the policy year end date for example, the day before the next anniversary of when the policy was made.</p>

<p>The date should be included in the format DDMMCCYY.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.6 </span> Number of years</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. Where the period a policy has run, or the period since the last event, is less than one year, this box should be completed by entering the number 1.</p>

<p>For death, surrender, maturity and whole assignment (categories of event 1 to 4), and the first part surrender or part assignment in relation to a particular policy or contract that is an event in categories of event 5 to 7, this is the number of complete years the policy or contract has run from when it was taken out to the date of the event or, for part surrenders and part assignments, to the end of the policy year end in which the surrender or assignment took place.</p>

<p>For part surrenders and part assignments (in categories of event 5 to 7) of a policy that is not a new non resident policy or an Overseas Life Assurance Business (<abbr title="Overseas Life Assurance Business">OLAB</abbr>) contract made on or after 17 March 1998, other than the first such surrender or assignment in relation to the policy or contract, it is the number of complete years the policy or contract has run from the end of the policy year in which the most recent earlier event occurred until the end of the policy year in which the surrender or assignment took place.</p>

<p>For part surrenders and part assignments (in categories of event 5 to 7) of a new non-resident policy or an <abbr title="Overseas Life Assurance Business">OLAB</abbr> contract made on or after 17 March 1998, this is the number of complete years the policy has run from when it was taken out to the end of the policy year in which the part surrender or assignment took place.</p>

<p>For gains arising on Personal Portfolio Bonds (in category of event 8), the entry must always be 1.</p>

<p>The number of years a policy of life insurance has run is measured from the date the earliest related policy was taken out. By ‘related policy’ is meant any policy in respect of which a later policy has been issued in substitution for, or in respect of which a later policy has been issued in consequence of an option conferred by another policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.7 </span> Amount of chargeable event gain</h3>

<p>This is the amount of the gain calculated in accordance with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>section 491 and 507 for life insurance policies and capital redemption policies where the chargeable event falls into category of event number 1 — 3 and 5 above</li>
  <li>section 491 and 507 for contracts for life annuities where the chargeable event falls into category 1 — 3 and 5 above</li>
  <li>section 511 where the chargeable event is in category of event number 6 of 7 above</li>
  <li>section 522 where there is a yearly gain for a Personal Portfolio Bond in category of event number 8 above</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount of the gain to be reported is the amount without any reduction which might be due for periods during which the policyholder was not resident (relief under section 553(3)), which may be available in connection with new non-resident policies and with <abbr title="Overseas Life Assurance Business">OLAB</abbr> contracts made on or after 17 March 1998.</p>

<p>No entry is required here if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.8 </span> Income Tax treated as paid</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. The gains from most, but not all, policies and contracts with UK insurers are chargeable to tax as if Income Tax at the basic rate had already been paid on the amount of the gain. The types of policy and contract issued by UK insurers which do not entitle a policyholder who is an individual or a trustee to be treated as having suffered basic rate tax on the amount of the gain are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>policies of life insurance and contracts for life annuities made by a friendly society in the course of tax exempt life or endowment business</li>
  <li>contracts for life annuities made after 26 March 1974 but in an accounting period of the insurance company beginning before 1 January 1992</li>
  <li>policies of life insurance that form part of the <abbr title="Overseas Life Assurance Business">OLAB</abbr> of an insurance company or friendly society made on or after 17 March 1998, or varied (and for this purpose any exercise of rights conferred by the policy shall be regarded as a variation) on or after 17 March 1998 so as to increase the benefits secured or to extend the term</li>
</ul>

<p>Insurers should complete this box on the assumption that the person chargeable to tax on the gain is an individual, even if the holder of the policy is a company. A company is not entitled to be treated as if basic rate tax has been paid on a gain it makes.</p>

<p>Enter Y for yes and N for no.</p>

<h4>Amount of Income Tax treated as paid</h4>

<p>The amount of Income Tax treated as paid is the amount of the gain multiplied by the basic rate for the relevant year. The relevant year is the year of assessment to which the gain is attributable.</p>

<p>When completing this field, the insurer may assume that the person chargeable to tax on the gain is an individual.  The relevant year of assessment to which a gain is attributable is the year of assessment in which the event was treated as arising, this includes the end of the policy year (as defined section 499) in which any part surrender or assignment took place.</p>

<p>No entry is required here if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4) or if the entry in the field ‘Income Tax treated as paid’ is ‘N’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.9 </span> Total of previous gains</h3>

<p>An entry is only required if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<p>This amount is the aggregate of all previous gains that have arisen before the happening of the chargeable event in connection with the policy or contract as a result of part surrenders or part assignments that were chargeable events in categories of event 5 to 7, or of gains arising on Personal Portfolio Bonds in category of event 8.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.10 </span> Premiums or consideration paid</h3>

<p>An entry is only required if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<p>For a life insurance policy or a capital redemption policy, the amount of premiums or consideration means the total amount previously paid under the policy by way of premiums.</p>

<p>For a contract for a life annuity, the amount of premiums or consideration means the total amount previously paid under the contract by way of premiums or as lump sum consideration.</p>

<p>The entry here includes any premiums or consideration paid under any ‘related policy’. The term ‘related policy’ means any policy in respect of which a later policy has been issued in substitution for, or in respect of which a later policy has been issued in consequence of an option conferred by another policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.11 </span> Relevant capital payments</h3>

<p>An entry is only required if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<p>The amount of relevant capital payments in relation to any policy or contract means the aggregate amount of any sum or other benefit of a capital nature, other than one attributable to a person’s disability, that has been paid or conferred under the policy or contract before the happening of the chargeable event.</p>

<p>The amount of relevant capital payments includes any sums or other benefits paid or conferred under any ‘related policy’. The term ‘related policy’ means any policy in respect of which a later policy has been issued in substitution for, or in respect of which a later policy has been issued in consequence of an option conferred by another policy.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.12 </span> Value of parts previously assigned</h3>

<p>An entry is only required if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<p>The amount is the aggregate of the surrender values previous part assignments would have had if the parts assigned had instead been surrendered, including part assignments for no money or money’s worth made before 6 April 2001 but excluding part assignments made by way of gift on or after that date.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.13 </span> Capital elements paid on account of an annuity</h3>

<p>An entry is only required if the chargeable event is a whole assignment (category of event 4).</p>

<p>The insurer must make an entry here only where the insurance contract is a purchased life annuity as defined in section 717(4) and section 423 and payments have been made on account of the annuity before the happening of the chargeable event. The amount is the aggregate of capital element included in the payment or payments as determined in accordance with section 656.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">10.14 </span> Number of policyholders</h3>

<p>Insurers must report this for every gain. This field denotes the number of appropriate policyholders.
 An ‘Appropriate policyholder’ is defined in section 552(10). Where the event is in category 7 — see paragraph 11.3, the appropriate policyholder is one who was either the policyholder or one of the policyholders immediately before the event and was also the assignor or one of the assignors. For all other events, the appropriate policyholder is the policyholder or policyholders immediately before the event occurred.</p>

<p>The information should be included as a 3 digit number for example, 004.</p>

<p>A body of trustees counts as one policyholder for this purpose.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">11. </span> Type 3 record</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.1 </span> Policyholder title</h3>

<p>This may be a zero length field. It contains the title component of the policyholder’s name for example, Mr, Mrs, Doctor, and so on.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.2 </span> Policyholder forenames</h3>

<p>This may be a zero length field. It contains the forenames or initials component of the policyholder’s name.</p>

<p>Where the insurer knows that this component field contains only initials, HMRC requires the initials to be spaced, make sure that the size of this field as defined in the type 1 record allows for separating spaces.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.3 </span> Policyholder name</h3>

<p>It contains the surname component of the policyholder’s name for structured names and contains the policyholder’s full name for unstructured names, including where a body of trustees or a company is a policyholder.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.4 </span> Policyholder address</h3>

<p>This should be the policyholder’s permanent residential address. A ‘Care of’ or other correspondence addresses are not permitted, nor is the address of the policyholder’s employer or financial adviser. If, exceptionally, the policyholder’s current permanent address is not known the insurer should report the last known address. If the insurer has been notified of a power of attorney being granted for a policyholder, the insurer may enter the attorney’s address on the certificate. The postcode must be reported in all cases with a UK address, if known by insurer.</p>

<h4>Insurer holds address lines of different lengths</h4>

<p>If the insurer holds address lines of different lengths, then each address line should be padded with spaces to the length defined in the policyholder address line length field in the type 1 record.</p>

<h4>Number of address lines</h4>

<p>The number of address lines supplied should correspond to the number defined in the policyholder address line count field in the type 1 record.</p>

<p>If the address is not held as a number of separate lines, (for example, there is one single field holding all of the address) it is helpful if the address, street, city and other components are separated by commas.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">11.5 </span> Policyholder postcode</h3>

<p>The value of the policyholder postcode supplied field in the type 1 record will determine whether the postcode is to be supplied as part of the address or not.</p>

<p>Policyholder postcode supplied = ‘N’</p>

<p>The postcode must be provided as part of the address since the insurer does not hold the postcode in a separate field. HMRC will interpret the length to be zero.</p>

<p>Policyholder postcode supplied = ‘Y’</p>

<p>The postcode should not be supplied as part of the address. HMRC will interpret this to be CHAR(8). Left justify pad with spaces.</p>

<h2>Appendix G — problems</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">13. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to identify potential problems that could occur in the light of previous returns, such as Section 17/18 and <abbr title="tax-exempt special savings account">TESSA</abbr> (tax-exempt special savings account) returns, and to avoid similar problems from occurring with the Chargeable Event Certificate reports.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">13.1 </span>  General or clerical problems</h3>

<p>Use of non-unique batch numbers within a sub-report of certificates:</p>

<p>HMRC expects each report to be made up of 1 or more batches. Batch numbers must commence after the previous number used for that tax year and be sequential for each sub-report. Some problems were experienced here for various reasons, such as those outlined in the following:</p>

<h4>13.1.1 Sub-report produced at 2 or more different locations</h4>

<p>This can occur when the labelling and sending exercise has not been co-ordinated (for example, more than one location sending in part of a sub-report with their own numbering system). This problem can be overcome by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>splitting the sub-report into 2 or more separate sub-reports, one from each site, and use unique sub-report numbers for each location</li>
  <li>collating all the files for a given sub-report at one central point and then format the naming and sending with consistent numbering</li>
</ul>

<h4>13.1.2 Incomplete sub-reports</h4>

<p>Insurers should make sure that the batch number given relates to the next batch sequence number (not starting at 1), if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit the sub-report in several parts</li>
  <li>realise that some certificates have been omitted from a sub-report after being sent to HMRC and you’re requested to supply an extra batch</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Original submission<br>
Sub-report: P1101/01<br>
Batch 1 of 2<br> 
Batch 2 of 2<br></p>

<p>Additional submission<br>
Sub report: P1101/01<br>
Batch 3 of 3</p>

<p>Do not generate a new sub-report containing the original submission. You should generate an additional submission using the next available batch number for the sub-report.</p>

<h4>13.1.3 Batch numbers on each sub-report not commencing with 1</h4>

<p>Batch numbers must start at 1 and be sequential for each sub-report. Problems can occur as a result of many misinterpretations between sub-report and batches.</p>

<p>Correct example:<br>
Sub-report : B1101/01<br>
Batch 1<br>
Sub-report : B1101/02<br>
Batch 1<br>
Sub-report : B1101/03<br>
Batch 1</p>

<p>Incorrect example:<br>
Sub-report : B1101/01<br>
Batch 1 of 3<br>
Sub-report : B1101/02<br>
Batch 2 of 3<br>
Sub-report : B1101/03<br>
Batch 3 of 3</p>

<p>In the incorrect example, the batch numbers do not commence at 1 for each sub-return.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">14. </span> Chargeable event submission batches</h2>

<h4>14.1 Incorrect naming</h4>

<p>Take care in filling in the batch information. For example, a sub-report comprising of 4 batches would be named as:</p>

<p>Batch 1 of 4<br>
Batch 2 of 4<br>
Batch 3 of 4<br>
Batch 4 of 4</p>

<p>Whereas a sub-report which is split into 2 reproducible batches would be named as follows:</p>

<p>Batch 1 of 2<br>
Batch 2 of 2</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">15. </span> Physical problems</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.1 </span> Use of too many type 4 records</h3>

<p>Each batch has only one type 4 record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.2 </span> Re-submissions</h3>

<p>This refers to re-submissions either after failed batches or due to notification of errors by the financial institutions. When re-submitting, use the original sub-report reference number and batch numbers. When you resubmit make sure you tell Data Acquisition and Exchange by emailing: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk">da.enquiries@hmrc.gov.uk</a> or <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tpi.c@hmrc.gov.uk">tpi.c@hmrc.gov.uk</a>. You will need to give them the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reason</li>
  <li>original references</li>
  <li>batches</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.3 </span> Data after type 4</h3>

<p>No data should appear after the type 4 record. Any data found after the type 4 record will be queried and a letter will need to be submitted to assure HMRC that the data after the type 4 is not valuable data, such as extra records, and may be ignored by HMRC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.4 </span> Incorrect batches submitted</h3>

<p>Some insurers submit batches containing non-chargeable event data. Make sure you only submit the correct batches to HMRC.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">15.5 </span> Incorrect number of batches in a return</h3>

<p>Some financial institutions submitted returns consisting of many batches. On further examination, some of these batches were found to be blank. You should make sure that all batches within a return contain data.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">16. </span> Incorrect data file format</h2>

<p>You should not send files in any software format except the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reporting-of-chargeable-event-gains-life-insurance-policies">official HMRC chargeable events spreadsheet</a>. You should always use the latest version.</p>

<p>For HMRC spreadsheets or text files following the electronic flat text file specifications, submitted on physical media, read Appendix A.</p>

<p>Data submitted in line with the chargeable events electronic flat text file specifications should be in ASCII or UTF8 (multibyte) character sets. These must conform to the field layouts described in the specification.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">17. </span> Data content problems</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.1 </span> Missing record identifier</h3>

<p>Some financial institutions omitted to supply record identifiers at the start of each record. This causes the submission to fail and cannot be circumvented. This is a mandatory field without which HMRC will be unable to interpret the data supplied. These cored identifiers should form the first byte of each record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.2 </span> Reference number</h3>

<p>Some financial institutions supplied either the incorrect HMRC reference number or used a dummy reference number for the live submission.</p>

<p>Example: if the reference number is C0902/01, C902/01 is not acceptable.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.3 </span> Field lengths in record type 3 not consistent with record type 1</h3>

<p>It was sometimes found that the field lengths of the dynamic fields which had been set up in the type 1 record did not in fact agree with what was actually used to generate the type 3. Make sure of consistency between the 2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.4 </span> Name and address fields populated when no data is available</h3>

<p>Problems are caused when many name/address fields for which no data is available contain repeated patterns such as ‘<strong>**name unknown</strong><strong>’, ‘</strong><strong>address unknown</strong>**’ or ‘strictly confidential. If this information is not available for some records, leave the fields space filled up to the sizes defined in the type 1 record.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">17.5 </span> Incorrect type 2 count</h3>

<p>The type 4 ‘count’ should be a count of only the type 2 records supplied in the batch. It should not be misinterpreted as the grand total of all type 1, 2 and 3 records supplied in the batch.</p>

<h2>Appendix H — live submission instructions</h2>

<h2>
<span class="number">18. </span> Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are not responsible for producing and sending the chargeable event sub-report, you should give this information to the right person.</p>

<p>This is so that all sub-reports are sent with the correct name.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">19. </span> Structure of information</h2>

<p>Each insurer will deliver one or more sub-reports of certificates. These are divided into one or more reproducible batches.</p>

<p>Many insurers will only submit one sub-report, made up of one batch of Chargeable Events Certificates. However, some sub-reports may need divided into several batches.</p>

<p>See the glossary section for the definition of sub-reports and batches in this guide.</p>

<p>A new sequence of batch numbers should start for each tax year.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">20. </span> Completion instructions</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">20.1 </span> Sub-report information</h3>

<p>The financial institution name and reference should reflect the insurer and unique HMRC reference to which the data applies.</p>

<p>Contact the Data Acquisition and Exchange by email at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:tpi.c@hmrc.gov.uk">tpi.c@hmrc.gov.uk</a> if you cannot remember the HMRC reference or sub number.</p>
