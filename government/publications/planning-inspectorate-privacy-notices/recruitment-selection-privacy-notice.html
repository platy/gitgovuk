<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>As a prospective employer the Planning Inspectorate must meet its statutory and administrative obligations. We are committed to ensuring that the personal data of our candidates applying for roles within the Planning Authority is handled in accordance with the principles set out in data protection laws. The wording in this notice reflects the requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and will be updated to reflect any future changes to data protection laws as required.</p>

<p>It relates to the Recruitment and Selection Process Planning Inspectorate uses for candidates, agency candidates and contractors. it advises candidates about the specifics of the personal data handling practices within the Planning Inspectorate. It informs you about what personal data we may collect, how we may collect it, use it, store it and disposal of it and what you can expect when the Planning Inspectorate to do with the information it collects. However, the information we will process about you will vary depending on your specific role and personal circumstances.</p>

<p>This Privacy Notice does not form part of a contract of employment or other contract to provide services. When appropriate we will provide a ‘just in time’ notice to cover any additional processing activities not mentioned in this document.</p>

<p>This Privacy Notice may be updated at and/or re-issued at any time, and we will provide you with notice of any such updates via the Planning Inspectorate’s page on GOV.UK. At our discretion, where any updates are substantial updates, we may notify you by other means or in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal information.</p>

<h2>Personal Data Definition</h2>

<p>Any references to “personal information” or “personal data” or “data” within the body of this Privacy Notice, shall be taken to mean the same and shall have the meaning given to “personal data” by the UK GDPR (or any subsequent applicable law, for example the Data Protection Act 2018).</p>

<p>The UK GDPR defines personal data as “any information relating to a data subject [from which they can be identified]” (at Article 4(1)). It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). A data subject is the identified or identifiable person to whom the personal data relates and, in relation to this Privacy Notice, is candidates, agency candidates and contractors.</p>

<p>There are “special categories” of personal data (referred to by previous law as “sensitive personal data”), these are more sensitive in nature and therefore we afford this category of personal data the highest level of protection.</p>
