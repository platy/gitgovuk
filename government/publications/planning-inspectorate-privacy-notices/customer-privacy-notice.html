<h2>Purpose of this Privacy Notice</h2>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that the personal data of our customers is handled in accordance with the principles set out in data protection laws.</p>

<p>This privacy notice reflects the requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 and covers all types of Planning Inspectorate Casework for England and Wales.  On 1st October 2021 responsibility for the Planning Inspectorate’s work in Wales will transfer to Welsh Government. This will be complemented by the transfer of customer records and once this transition has occurred the handling of customers’ data will be in line with Welsh Government data handling and privacy policies.</p>

<p>It informs you about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the specifics of the personal data handling practices within the Planning Inspectorate and what you can expect the Planning Inspectorate to do with the information it collects</li>
  <li>what personal information we collect, how we collect it, use it, store it, share it, and dispose of it</li>
  <li>personal information provided as part of all Planning Inspectorate Casework that you can make, or comment on, or is provided by other Government Departments and Organisations using any of the Planning Inspectorate’s Websites or other means</li>
  <li>how we process any personal information including special category data you have voluntarily provided to us relating directly to you or any other third-party individual’s information you may have provided relating to your Planning Appeal via the Appeals Casework, Local Plans, Community Infrastructure Levy Schedules, Spatial Development Strategy, Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) and the Development of National Significance (DNS) Projects Websites</li>
</ul>

<p>The Planning inspectorate handles a variety of casework types which are submitted via the websites below and a variety of other methods e.g. Post, Digital Transfer and Email.</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Appeals Casework Portal handles a range of Planning and Enforcement Appeals (as documented in Annex A)</li>
  <li>the National Infrastructure Planning Website (as documented in Annex A)</li>
  <li>Developments of National Significance Website handles Applications and Examinations (as documented in Annex B)</li>
  <li>in certain specialist casework the Inspectorate will publish documents on the GOV.UK Website</li>
</ul>

<p>It also provides information about our processing of personal information when dealing with complaints.</p>

<p>This Privacy Notice may be updated and/or re-issued at any time, and we will provide you with notice of any such updates via the GOV.UK and Planning Inspectorate’s websites.</p>

<p>At our discretion, we may notify you by providing a ‘just in time’ notice to cover any additional processing activities not mentioned in this document.</p>

<h2>Personal Data Definition</h2>

<p>The UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data relating to an individual (data subject) who is the identified or identifiable person to whom the personal data relates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when the data subject can be directly or indirectly identified from that information in combination with other information</li>
  <li>wholly or partly by automated means the processing other than by automated means of personal data which forms part of, or is intended to form part of, a filing system</li>
  <li>personal data only includes information relating to natural persons who can be Identified or who are identifiable, directly from the information in question</li>
  <li>information about individuals acting as sole traders, employees, partners, and company directors where they are individually identifiable, and the information relates to them as an individual may constitute personal data</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where the identity of participants has been removed (anonymised data)</li>
  <li>information about a deceased person</li>
  <li>companies or Public Authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>There are “special categories” of personal data (SCD) (this was known as “sensitive personal data” in previous data protection law), these are more sensitive in nature and require specific handling under the legislation.</p>

<h3>Policy commitment to openness and transparency</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental values of the Planning Inspectorate is its commitment to openness and transparency in respect of our statutory role processing and deciding planning and all other related casework.</p>

<p>In many instances in particular planning processes there are obligations that require us to share the information that we receive, and in some instances for this to be made publicly available. We apply a general presumption in favour of disclosure, but individual decisions will take into account the statutory obligations on us, including under data protection legislation.</p>

  <li>the Planning Inspectorate deals with all aspects of planning appeals, national infrastructure planning applications, examinations of local plans and any other planning-related and specialist casework</li>
  <li>these are undertaken by the Planning Inspectorate or on behalf of relevant Secretaries of State’ in England</li>
  <li>for Community Infrastructure Levy Schedules (CILs), our Inspectors are appointed by the Charging Authority to examine their Charging Schedule</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> How do we collect personal information?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>you will have directly provided information to us, if you make or take part, in a planning appeal, application or examination as part of our planning processes</li>
  <li>you may also provide us indirectly with special category information where you are providing information regarding your personal circumstance (which may also include personal and special category of other data subjects) that you want to be considered within the planning processes</li>
  <li>Local Authorities (LAs) are normally required to provide us with relevant information relating to the case e.g. on a planning appeal they will send us the representations that they received at the planning application stage</li>
  <li>for Local Plans the Local Authorities (LA) submit information to us in respect of their proposed local plan or CIL schedule including the representations that they received on it</li>
  <li>during the examination, the Inspector will also hear oral representations from the parties and consider any further written representations that are accepted during that examination</li>
  <li>the LA will provide a programme officer to support the Inspector, and representations are exchanged between the LA and other participants in the examination and the Inspector through the programme officer</li>
  <li>other Government departments &amp; agencies provide relevant information</li>
  <li>via our websites, e.g. connection data sent to our webserver by your browser when you connect to our website</li>

<ul>
  <li>the Planning Inspectorate will provide guidance to making and taking part in casework types and references to the statutory procedural rules that apply</li>
  <li>in accordance with the statutory rules, casework representations are normally copied to the appellant/applicant, the Local Authority (LA) and other statutory parties to the case</li>
  <li>the LA is also required to make the casework representations available to anyone who wishes to see them</li>
  <li>as they provide context to your representation and allow for the effective running of the case e.g. allowing parties with similar viewpoints to identify each other and agree joint presentation of views at any hearing or inquiry), the representations that we receive are normally exchanged between the parties without redaction of content or contact information, subject to the condition that the Planning Inspectorate determines that it is both necessary and proportionate to do so</li>
  <li>the information voluntarily provided can directly or indirectly include personal information about other individuals and can include special category data e.g. medical information of other parties (please see Special Category Data paragraph for further information). The Planning Inspectorate will only process such data where it is warranted and has the appropriate legal basis to do so</li>
  <li>please note that we do not accept anonymous or confidential representations, however, you may comment on a case and ask for your identity to be withheld</li>
  <li>if you request this then your representation will be copied to the parties and provided to the Inspector without your name and contact details, and your representation may be given less weight by the Inspector as a result</li>
  <li>in the event that you do not want to be identifiable from your representation you should avoid including information which may identify you</li>
</ul>

<p>The appointed Inspector will consider the information provided in the representations and reach their decision. Their decision notice will provide the outcome for the case and their reasoning</p>

<h3>The information we publish on the ACP</h3>

  <li>although we may not publish every document or every case, we have a statutory obligation to copy representations to the relevant parties. The LA is obliged to make them available to anyone who may wish to see them so you may also want to check with them what information they publish</li>
</ul>

<h3>National Infrastructure Planning Website for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP)</h3>

<p>The information provided for NSIPs is used to assist the examination of applications under the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/29/contents" rel="external">Planning Act 2008</a> process.
It provides information about the types of personal information the Planning Inspectorate may collect when carrying out our duties and responsibilities under the Planning Act 2008. 
It is important to note that The Planning Inspectorate has statutory functions and duties under the Planning Act 2008, its procedural rules and regulations which require us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make certain documents and information widely available to other participants, which may include personal information, including making these publicly available</li>
  <li>we do this by publishing documents and information on the National Infrastructure Planning website</li>
  <li>if you have specific queries or concerns in respect of this processing of your personal data, then please contact the relevant case officer in the first instance to discuss the guidance and your concerns</li>
  <li>in accordance with Rule 21 of The Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010, the Planning Inspectorate must make all Relevant Representations, Written Representations and other documents submitted in relation to the examination of an application available to the public</li>
  <li>under s39 of the Planning Act 2008 we are also required to make available to the public the documents comprising each application for development consent. In both cases this is achieved by publishing these documents on the National Infrastructure Planning website</li>
  <li>under section 51 of the Planning Act 2008 we are also required to publish any advice that we issue about applying for a Development Consent Order; and making a representation about an application for a Development Consent Order</li>

  <li>this report is sent to the Secretary of State, who takes the final decision on applications under the Planning Act 2008</li>
  <li>please note that we do not accept anonymous or confidential representations</li>
</ul>

<h3>The information that we publish online</h3>

<p>The Planning Act 2008 and the statutory procedural rules and regulations require us to publish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>application documents</li>
  <li>relevant Representations, Written Representations, and other documents on the National Infrastructure Planning website</li>
  <li>these published records will include the name of the person that has submitted the document</li>
  <li>the Inspector or Inspectors appointed to carry out the examination of an application</li>
  <li>before publishing most documents, we redact (or ‘blank out’) certain personal details e.g. telephone numbers; addresses; email addresses; signatures and sensitive personal information (special category data)</li>
  <li>we also redact any content that we consider to be potentially libellous</li>
  <li>we don’t redact any personal information in documents produced by applicants where this would hinder the effective examination of an application e.g. the Planning Inspectorate’s carrying out of its public task. For example, certain documents that are published (e.g. the Book of Reference) include the names and addresses of Interested Parties because the land or rights of those Interested Parties would be affected by the Proposed Development</li>
  <li>we also publish the Examining Authority’s Recommendation Report and the Secretary of State’s decision usually without redaction but subject to our data protection obligations, both of which may contain personal information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Management Information Data Warehouse</h3>

<p>The Planning Inspectorate uses  a data warehouse to support production of analysis and management information. This is used to help in the delivery of more efficient services  to our customers. The data that is used includes information collected in the course of handling casework and will include personal data. Wherever possible we only use aggregated data which is anonymised so that no individual can be identified from it. Where this is not possible we will apply data minimisation and pseudonomisation to the processing of this data as appropriate and the data will only be accessible by a restricted number of Planning Inspectorate staff.</p>

<p>A virtual event (VE) is one where there are no physical attendees. All attendees participate virtually, either through video conferencing or telephone.</p>

<p>A Blended Event (BE) is one where there may be a combination of physical attendees (in one or more locations) as well as a virtual element (where participants can join either through video conferencing or telephone). The two elements need not take place simultaneously but could potentially be staggered in time provided that the proceedings are broadcast and made accessible to those who cannot participate in one of the events.</p>

<h3>What personal information will be collected at a Virtual &amp; Blended Events?</h3>

<h4>How is it collected?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>e-mail address requested in event invite</li>
  <li>phone numbers - If the participant joins by phone, your phone  number would be visible to all participants (this can be masked by the  individual by turning off Caller ID, generally known as dialling 141) in which case a random number is displayed</li>
  <li>IP address - Connections to Microsoft Teams will capture the IP address of the participant</li>
  <li>display Name – This is collected from the participants joining details</li>
