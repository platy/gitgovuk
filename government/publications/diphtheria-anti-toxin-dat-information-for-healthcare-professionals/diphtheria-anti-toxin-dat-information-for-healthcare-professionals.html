  <li>
<abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is made from horse serum and people with a history of a horse allergy should undergo a sensitivity screen prior to <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> treatment</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>?</h2>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is an antiserum used for the treatment of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmed or probable diphtheria cases <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>for treatment of confirmed infections, where clinically appropriate, due to toxigenic Corynebacteria ulcerans or C. diphtheriae</li>
</ul>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is made from equine serum. People with a history of allergy to horses (including asthma, allergic rhinitis, or urticaria or other symptoms of distress when in close proximity to horses) or prior exposure to equine-derived immunoglobulin should undergo sensitivity testing prior to administration of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(1,2)</a>.</p>

<p>Full details on how to undertake sensitivity testing can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immunoglobulin-when-to-use/diphtheria-anti-toxin-clinical-guidance-issued-may-2022#sensitivity">Diphtheria anti-toxin: clinical guidance</a>.</p>

<h2>Why <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is used</h2>

<p>Early treatment with <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>, when indicated, is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity of patients with diphtheria. The causative agents of diphtheria are toxigenic C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. If left untreated, the bacterial toxin can enter the circulation leading to cardiac and neurologic sequelae <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(3-5)</a>.</p>

<p>Mortality rates for clinical diphtheria frequently exceeded 50% in the pre-antitoxin era. Almost as soon as antitoxin was available, clinical experience showed dramatic declines in mortality in groups of patients treated with antitoxin compared to historical control groups or groups treated at hospitals not using antitoxin. In one controlled trial in which patients at a hospital were allocated to antitoxin treatment or no antitoxin treatment on an alternating day schedule, mortality in treated patients was 3.3% compared to 12.2% in untreated patients <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(6)</a>.  Antibiotics may be used in conjunction with <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> to help eliminate the bacteria and toxin production, and to prevent transmission to others <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(3)</a>.</p>

<h2>When <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should be used</h2>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should be considered for use in cases of probable or confirmed cases of diphtheria, due to toxigenic C. ulcerans or C. diphtheria. <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> may be used for the following presentations of diphtheria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>severe diphtheria, for example, extensive membrane and/or severe oedema (‘bull neck’)</li>
  <li>any laryngeal or pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal disease</li>
  <li>cutaneous diphtheria but only when the skin lesion is sufficiently large (greater than 2cm<sup>2</sup>) and membranous</li>
</ul>

<p>When <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is indicated, usually in severely unwell cases or at risk of severe outcomes, prompt treatment of diphtheria is imperative. The risk of complications and fatal outcome increases with each day <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> administration is delayed. This is because <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is mainly effective against circulating diphtheria toxin and once the toxin is bound to tissues <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is less effective. When there is an urgent need for consideration of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> use the case should be discussed with (or cared for by) an infectious disease physician and the <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> <abbr title="Health Protection Team">HPT</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr> Duty Doctor who can co-ordinate issuing <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>.</p>

<p>For probable or confirmed cases <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is administered following on an initial, presumptive clinical diagnosis, and is given as early as possible, even before laboratory results for bacteriological confirmation are obtained <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(7)</a>.</p>

<h2>How effective is <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>?</h2>

<p>Better outcomes are seen when <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is given early when indicated. Studies have found increases in severity of morbidity and mortality increases when treatment is delayed. After 3 days since symptom onset, the risk of complications and fatal outcomes increases with each day <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is delayed <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(3)</a>. A Latvian study found <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> to be ineffective when administered after the second day of symptoms <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(8)</a>.</p>

<p>In a controlled trial where patients were allocated to antitoxin treatment or no antitoxin treatment on alternating days, mortality increased progressively based on the interval from onset of illness to treatment, with a sharp increase from 4% mortality in those treated with antitoxin within 24 to 48 hours to 16.1% in those treated on the third day of illness <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(5)</a>. Mortality rates continued to increase with more prolonged intervals, reaching 29.9% in those treated 7 or more days after onset <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(6)</a>.</p>

<h2>How <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> works</h2>

<p>Diphtheria toxin typically binds to neural and cardiac tissues, causing irreversible damage. <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is made up of concentrated proteins (mainly globulins), containing antibodies from the serum of horses that have been immunized against diphtheria. It acts by neutralising the toxins produced by C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis.</p>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> can only neutralise free toxin which has not yet bound to cells <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(9)</a>, which is why early administration is important to optimise outcomes. Current thinking is that toxin fixes to susceptible cells early in disease and fixed toxin is not neutralized by antitoxin <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(6)</a>.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are often used in conjunction with <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> to eradicate the organism. The <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> serves to neutralise circulating toxin, to prevent it binding to tissues and causing irreversible organ damage.</p>

<h2>Safety of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> and precautions for administration</h2>

<p>Administration of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> may cause hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Prior to administration, a detailed history should be taken including previous administration of equine-derived anti-toxin or immunoglobulins and regarding any known animal allergy, specifically equine allergy. Diphtheria antitoxin is derived from horse serum and reactions are common <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(11)</a>. People with a history of allergy to horses (including asthma, allergic rhinitis, or urticaria or other symptoms of distress when in close proximity to horses) or prior exposure to equine-derived immunoglobulin should undergo sensitivity testing prior to administration of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>. Full details on how to undertake sensitivity testing can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immunoglobulin-when-to-use/diphtheria-anti-toxin-clinical-guidance-issued-may-2022#sensitivity">Diphtheria anti-toxin: clinical guidance</a>.</p>

<p>Patients with positive sensitivity testing to <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> or with a previous history of adverse reaction to <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should undergo desensitisation, with full details on how to do this also found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immunoglobulin-when-to-use/diphtheria-anti-toxin-clinical-guidance-issued-may-2022#sensitivity">Diphtheria anti-toxin: clinical guidance</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> can be safely administered provided there is continuous patient monitoring during the infusion, staff training on management of adverse effects, and attention to safety precautions <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(10)</a>.</p>

<p>Staff administering <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should be fully trained in the management of anaphylaxis and administration should take place within facilities able to provide appropriate specialist support. Further information is available from the Resuscitation Council UK’s  <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.resus.org.uk/library/additional-guidance/guidance-anaphylaxis/emergency-treatment" rel="external">Emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions: guidelines for healthcare providers</a>.</p>

<p>Serum sickness can occur in up to 5% of patients according to historic data, usually around 7 to 12 days after the first injection although accelerated reactions have been reported in patients who have previously received equine anti-toxin preparations, with onset within days or even hours. Symptoms include more generalised erythema, urticaria, itching, and occasionally fever, pain and oedema of the joints and lymph nodes.</p>

<p>Treatment is supportive, with anti-inflammatory preparations and antihistamine to provide symptomatic relief although systemic steroids may be needed in more severe cases.</p>

<p>In a recent large outbreak of diphtheria in Bangladesh 25% of patients who received <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> had at least one adverse reaction, however most reactions were mild (cough, rash, itching) and resolved quickly. Three percent had severe hypersensitivity reactions that were consistent with anaphylaxis. Even though most of these patients were not diagnosed as having anaphylaxis at the time, and were not treated as such, all but one of the patients recovered quickly. Five patients died during their <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> infusion or soon afterwards, but no deaths were attributed to <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(10)</a>.</p>

<p>For comparison, in the 1993 to 1996 outbreak in the Republic of Georgia, 2% of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>-treated patients (8 cases) had anaphylactic shock <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(12)</a> and in a review of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> usage in the United States, low rates of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> associated adverse events were recorded, and deaths in those who received <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> were attributed to other causes <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(13)</a>.</p>

<p>Risk of hypersensitivity increases with additional doses of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>. The dose of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should be determined by the severity and duration of the disease as defined in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immunoglobulin-when-to-use/diphtheria-anti-toxin-clinical-guidance-issued-may-2022#dosage">Diphtheria anti-toxin: clinical guidance</a> <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(1)</a>. Further doses are not required if the full recommended dose is given. If a sub-optimal dose is administered, the responsible clinician should discuss further treatment with an infectious diseases consultant and in collaboration with specialists at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>. The decision to give additional doses of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> will depend on severity of diseases and the time delay between doses.</p>

<h2>Is there time beyond which <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> is no longer indicated?</h2>

<p>Complications from toxin can occur late, after 2 to 6 weeks and may include cranial and peripheral nerve palsies and myocarditis (which may occur both in early as well as later phases of the disease) and are often severe <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(9)</a>.</p>

<p>Using <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> beyond the early stages of toxigenic diphtheria should be discussed with an infectious diseases consultant and specialists at <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>, given that the benefit from <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> declines with time since disease onset.</p>

<h2>Pregnancy and <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr>
</h2>

<p><abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> (equine) should be used cautiously during pregnancy <a class="govuk-link" href="#refs">(1)</a>.</p>

<p>There are limited data on the use of <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> in pregnant women however, there have been no reported signals to date to indicate that <abbr title="diphtheria anti-toxin">DAT</abbr> should not be used in pregnant women if required.</p>
