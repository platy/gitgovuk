<span class="number">1. </span>Advice in relation to the Marine Licensing Service</h2>

<p>Advice is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> on the marine licence application process and can be obtained by request through the online case management system.</p>

<p>Advice requests are assessed and categorised into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Band 3 – Pre-application screening advice and scoping opinions; and</li>
  <li>Band 3P – Advice which is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> as an additional service and may include discretionary advice</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Band 3 - Pre-application advice</h3>

<h4>Pre-application Screening</h4>

<p>This is the statutory process by which we determine whether or not a project will be subject to an environmental impact assessment and is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> before a Marine Licence Application has been submitted.</p>

<h4>Pre-application Scoping Opinion</h4>

<p>If requested, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> will provide advice on the information required for an environmental statement. Once an <abbr title="Environmental impact assessment">EIA</abbr> Scoping Opinion is requested this becomes a statutory process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Band 3P – Advice which is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> as an additional service and may include discretionary advice</h3>

<p>Advice can include (but is not limited to) the following:</p>

<h4>General enquiries:</h4>
<p>Enquiries for any advice in relation to the Marine Licensing Service.
If your enquiry is considered straightforward, we will provide a simple response. More complex queries may require a fee to be paid. Where this is the case we will discuss this with you and an estimate will be provided for acceptance before we start any work.</p>

<h4>Pre-application advice:</h4>
<p>Advice provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> before a Marine Licence Application has been submitted. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environmental Statement (ES) review – If requested, we may review draft environmental statements before they are submitted to us formally.</li>
  <li>Other – If you request advice, but does not lead to the submission of a Marine Licence Application.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Post-consent advice:</h4>
<p>Any advice that is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> after a Marine Licence has been issued.</p>

<h4>Other advice:</h4>
<p>Any advice that is provided by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> in relation to the Marine Licence Service.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Marine licence application Fees</h2>

<p>Marine licence applications are assessed and categorised into fee bands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="#self-service">Band 1</a> (Self-service)</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#band-2">Band 2</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#band-3">Band 3</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Band 1 (Self-service)</h2>

<p>Self-service marine licensing replaces the previous fast-track marine licence process which required bespoke consideration by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s case officers.</p>

<p>A self-service marine licence costs £50 payable in advance. Payment will only be accepted when made by credit or debit card. Payment will be prompted automatically at the appropriate stage of the online application process. Payments must NOT be made by BACS. Any BACS payments for self-service will be returned and no licence will be issued.</p>

<p>Activities which may qualify for a self-service licence include some:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deposits (including Burial at sea)</li>
  <li>minor removals</li>
  <li>maintenance activities</li>
  <li>non-navigational dredging</li>
</ul>

<p>Full details are contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-service-marine-licensing/self-service-activities-table">self-service activities table</a>. You should consider the activities table and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-service-marine-licensing/self-service-marine-licensing">self-service guidance</a> before using the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://marinelicensing.marinemanagement.org.uk/mmofox5/fox/live/MMO_WIZARD/direct?WQ_GROUP_MNEM=APPLICATION_WIZARD" rel="external">interactive assistance tool</a>. These resources can help you to understand whether a marine licence is required for your activity and whether the activity is one that qualifies for self-service marine licensing.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Variations</h2>

<p>If circumstances change, a Marine Licence can be varied or transferred and can be obtained by request through the online case management system.</p>

<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> may vary or transfer any extant Marine Licence. For example where there is a need to change or add conditions because new environmental information has come to light. Where the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> varies or transfers a Marine Licence then we may recover the cost of determination.
If a variation or transfer of a licence is required by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>, then the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> may choose to waive or reduce the fees.</p>

<p>If the licence holder requests a variation or transfer of their licence, then they must pay the appropriate fee. Applications for a variation or transfer are assessed and categorised into fee bands:</p>

<p>Band V0: A change to a licence where the charge has been waived by the <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>.</p>

<p>Band V1: Admin changes - Any application for a minor change to a marine licence, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A request to change the name or address of an agent, contractor or sub-contractor on a marine licence</li>
  <li>Changes to the name of a vessel or registration number of a vehicle transferring the licence from the licensee to another named person</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">9. </span>Calculating estimates and controlling costs</h2>

<p>You will receive an estimate of the maximum number of hours of casework required from <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> and <abbr title="Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr> staff members for all work needed before you apply and to complete Band 3 applications. The estimated hours are multiplied by the suitable hourly rate to give an estimated fee. You must accept the terms quoted before your application can progress.</p>

<p>Final charges invoiced by <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> are based upon actual hours, not the original estimate.</p>

<p>The staff time spent on your application is recorded accurately and this information is available to you. Time is charged in units of 15 minutes with a minimum of 15 minutes for each item of work.</p>

<p><abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> case managers monitor your application weekly to assess how many more case hours are needed. If the estimated final cost is likely to be significantly different from the actual final cost, you will be notified in good time. You will also receive an explanation of the circumstances and an updated estimate. You will also be informed when more than 90% of the estimated total number of hours has been used.</p>

<p>When an application is complete and valid, <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> review the fee band again before the application is accepted.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">10. </span>Charges for travel</h2>

<p>You will be charged for travel by <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> staff that relates to your case, regardless of the charging structure that is being applied. Travel charges are made on top of application fees. You will also be charged the actual travel and subsistence costs incurred whilst we travel to and from meetings.</p>

<p>Travel charges are calculated on <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr>’s and <abbr title="Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science">Cefas</abbr>’ hourly rates based on the current fee structure (explained above). You will be offered alternatives to <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> staff travelling where possible, such as meeting in <abbr title="Marine Management Organisation">MMO</abbr> offices in Newcastle-upon-Tyne or using electronic conferencing facilities.</p>
