<span class="number">1. </span>Update or recover lost details</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Lost scheme administrator or practitioner ID</h3>
<p>If you do not receive or have lost your scheme administrator or practitioner ID contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a> who will be able to issue you with your scheme administrator or practitioner ID through the post. HMRC will only be able to issue a scheme administrator or practitioner ID to the named individual or organisation and not to a third party.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span>Update scheme administrator or practitioner account details</h3>
<p>After you have registered and activated the online service you should visit ‘Your account’ and enter your email address. If you lose your online ID or password you can then get a reminder by email.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome" rel="external">Pension schemes online</a> start page, sign in using your user name and password.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Services you can use’ from the ‘Main menu’ on the left side of the screen.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Change details’. Enter your email address in the boxes provided and select ‘Next’. Check the details on screen and then select ‘Next’. The screen will then confirm that your details have been updated.</li>
</ol>

<span class="number">1.3 </span>User ID and password fail after not using them for 3 years</h3>

<h4>Scheme administrators</h4>

<p>As a pension scheme administrator you’ll not be able to access the service if both of these conditions apply. You’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registered on the Pension schemes online service</li>
  <li>not logged in to your business tax account in the past 3 years</li>
</ul>

<p>HMRC will have deleted your Government Gateway credentials.  We’ll still hold your:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pension scheme administrator ID</li>
  <li>information on the Pension schemes online service</li>
</ul>

<p>If you try to access the service using deleted credentials you’ll receive a message as if the credentials are incorrect.</p>

<p>If you have multiple users under one scheme administrator ID, check if any other users still have access. If they do, you’ll only need to follow steps 1 to 5. Once you’ve done this an existing administrator user can allocate the service to you.</p>

<p>To access Pension schemes online again follow steps 1 to 8 if you meet either of these conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re the only user</li>
  <li>all users have not logged in for over 3 years</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/government-gateway-registration-frontend?accountType=organisation&amp;continue=%2Fenrolment-management-frontend%2FHMRC-PSA-ORG%2Frequest-access-tax-scheme%3Fcontinue%3D%2Faccount&amp;origin=unknown&amp;registerForSa=skip" rel="external">sign in page</a> enter your email address and select ‘Continue’. You’ll receive a confirmation code by email address. Enter this code and select ‘Continue’. If you enter this correctly, this will confirm your email address and you can select ‘Continue’ again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next enter your full name and select ‘Continue’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll need to create a new password for your business tax account. This must be 10 or more characters. Select ‘Continue’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next set up recovery for your sign in details. Enter a recovery word that is between 6 and 12 characters and select ‘Continue’. You’ll see your new Government Gateway user ID. This will be sent to your email address. You have now set up your user ID and password. Select ‘Continue’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next you’ll need to request access to Pension schemes online service again. Enter your scheme administrator ID
and the postcode that it’s registered under. Then select ‘Request access’. If you do not know your scheme administrator ID, you’ll need to contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes services</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll see confirmation on screen that you’ve requested access to Pension schemes online for administrators. You’ll get an activation code in the post within 7 days to the address that your pension scheme administrator ID is registered under. If you select ‘Continue’ this will take you to your business tax account homepage. If you do not get your activation code within 7 days, you can request a new one from this page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’ve received your activation code, sign in to your business tax account and select ‘Access Pension schemes online for administrators’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the 12 character activation code and select ‘Get access’. You’ll then see on screen confirmation that you can access the service. If you select ‘Continue’, you’ll be taken to your business tax account homepage, where you can select the service.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Practitioners</h4>

<p>If you’re a pension scheme practitioner and have not signed in using your business tax account in the last 3 years, your credentials may also have been deleted. To get access again, use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/government-gateway-registration-frontend?accountType=organisation&amp;continue=%2Fenrolment-management-frontend%2FHMRC-PP-ORG%2Frequest-access-tax-scheme%3Fcontinue%3D%2Faccount&amp;origin=unknown&amp;registerForSa=skip&amp;_ga=2.105035658.845763263.1602063936-518068228.1601289963" rel="external">sign in page for practitioners</a>. Enter your email address and select ‘Continue’. You’ll receive a confirmation code by email address. Enter this code and select ‘Continue’. If you enter this correctly, this will confirm your email address and you can select ‘Continue’ again. You should then follow steps 2 to 8.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Add yourself as a scheme administrator to a pension scheme</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Schemes in existence before 6 April 2006</h3>
<p>Schemes that were approved by HMRC before 6 April 2006 will have automatically been added to Pension schemes online as a registered pension scheme unless the scheme opted out. The scheme will have been allocated a superannuation fund (<abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr>) reference number in the format 000/000000/000000/A. This is a numerical reference with a random letter at the end. Depending on the age of the scheme you may have a reference that looks slightly different.</p>

<p>Although the legislation set out who the scheme administrator was at 6 April 2006 in many cases this information was not held by HMRC at the time. If you were the administrator of a scheme at 5 April 2006 and not already told HMRC, you’ll need to add yourself to the scheme on Pension schemes online.</p>

<p>If you became the scheme administrator on or after 6 April 2006 and your scheme administrator ID begins with ‘A0’, you’ll need to add yourself to the scheme on Pension schemes online.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Pension Scheme Tax Reference and <abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr> reference number</h3>
<p>When adding yourself as a scheme administrator on Pension schemes online you’ll be asked for the scheme’s Pension Scheme Tax Reference (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>). If you do not have this but have an <abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr> reference number contact <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a> and they will issue the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>. You’ll need your scheme administrator ID, the <abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr> reference and scheme name in order for the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> to be traced.</p>

<p>If you do not have the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> or the <abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr> reference number or you’re not sure if it’s correct contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Add yourself as a scheme administrator</h3>
<ol>
  <li>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome" rel="external">Pension schemes online</a> start page sign in using your user name and password.</li>
  <li>Select ‘View account’ under ‘Pension schemes online for administrators’</li>
  <li>Select ‘Pension scheme for administrators product’ under the heading ‘File forms and returns’ (top-right box). You’ll be taken to the ‘Pension schemes online welcome page’.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Add yourself as a scheme administrator’ under the heading ‘Administration’ on the toolbar on the left side.</li>
  <li>You’ll be asked for the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>. If you do not have it you’ll need to contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a>. If you do not have the <abbr title="superannuation fund">SF</abbr> reference number or you think it might not be correct then contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a>. Enter the information requested and select ‘Add yourself as scheme administrator’ underneath.</li>
  <li>Enter the information requested and select ‘Add yourself as scheme administrator’ underneath.</li>
  <li>If the scheme was set up before 6 April 2006 you’ll now be asked if you were the scheme administrator before 6 April 2006. Select the appropriate option and select ‘Submit’.</li>
  <li>If you selected ‘Yes’ at stage 7 you’ll be presented with a pre-populated page with your scheme administrator details. Make sure they’re correct and then select the box next to ‘I (your name), confirm that the above information is correct’ and select ‘Submit’ then enter your User ID and password.</li>
  <li>If you selected ‘No’ at stage 7 or if the scheme was set up on or after 6 April 2006 you’ll need to tick a number of declaration boxes then select ‘Submit’ then enter your User ID and password.</li>
  <li>You’ll see a ‘Submission in progress’ screen. Do not attempt to resubmit the information or close your browser at this point. After a couple of minutes you’ll see the ‘Submission successful’ screen. You’ll be given the option to view the submission receipt. The <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> will appear in the body of the text.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have now successfully added yourself to your scheme but you  will not be able to view scheme records, make any amendments or file any returns for at least 24 hours. You may receive messages and notices about the scheme in your electronic notice board.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Act as a scheme administrator for more than one scheme</h3>
<p>Even if you’re the scheme administrator for more than one pension scheme you’ll only need one scheme administrator ID. You do not need to apply for a separate ID for each scheme.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Possible error message</h3>
<p>After attempting to submit your details you may receive a message saying that you cannot be added to that pension scheme because there is already a scheme administrator. This means that someone is registered as the scheme administrator on this record. To add yourself to the scheme you’ll need to get them to associate you to the scheme first — see section 3.</p>

<p>To find out who the scheme administrator is you’ll need to ask your co-trustees, colleagues or the establishing employer. The Pension schemes helpline are unable to disclose this information. You should only contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a> if you’re unable to contact or trace the previous registered scheme administrator.</p>

<p>For any other error messages or IT issues you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/online-services-helpdesk">Online services helpdesk</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>Pension schemes registered on or after 6 April 2006</h3>
<p>Pension schemes registered on or after 6 April 2006 will have been registered by their scheme administrator and will normally have a scheme administrator shown on the record. For security reasons you will not be able to make your declaration that you’re the administrator of the scheme and have your details added to the record, until they have associated you to the scheme — see section 3. If that scheme administrator has stopped acting and there are no other scheme administrators registered on Pension schemes online then you should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Associate additional scheme administrators</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Associate a second or subsequent scheme administrator</h3>
<p>If there’s more than one scheme administrator for your scheme you must complete the ‘Associating a scheme administrator’ process online.</p>

<p>Before you start you need to make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>there’s currently a scheme administrator registered online with the scheme</li>
  <li>those who are waiting to tell us that they’re also scheme administrators have pre-registered for Pension schemes online  if not, they should contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/pension-scheme-enquiries">Pension schemes helpline</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme administrator on HMRC’s records needs to follow the process to add more scheme administrators. This is to make sure people do not add themselves incorrectly to a scheme and gain access to information they are not authorised to see. Once the process is completed the additional scheme administrators can tell HMRC that they should be added to the scheme record as described in section 2.</p>

<p>All communications will be sent to the first named scheme administrator unless they have stopped acting.</p>

<p>There’s no limit to the number of scheme administrators that can be added to a scheme.
To associate a second or subsequent scheme administrator you’ll need their scheme administrator ID.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome" rel="external">Pension schemes online</a> start page sign in using your user name and password.</li>
  <li>Select ‘View account’ under ‘Pension schemes online for administrators’.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Pension scheme for administrators product’ under the heading ‘File forms and returns’ (top-right box). You’ll be taken to the ‘Pension schemes online welcome page’.</li>
  <li>Select either ‘View all pension schemes’ from the left toolbar — this will give you a list of all the schemes you are added to as the scheme administrator, or you use the ‘Select a pension scheme’ function from the bottom-left box if you know the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> or submission reference.</li>
  <li>Either select the pension scheme you want or enter the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> . The ‘Pension scheme summary’ page will then be displayed.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Scheme administrator management’ from the bottom-left box and this will give you a list of the scheme administrators for that scheme. To associate a further scheme administrator select ‘Associate another scheme administrator’.</li>
  <li>To associate a scheme administrator enter their scheme administrator ID when prompted. The screen will remind you that the new scheme administrator must go online and add themselves to this scheme once you have completed the process. Select ‘Next’.</li>
  <li>Details of the ‘new’ scheme administrator will now be displayed on a ‘Scheme administrator overview’. If you want to associate a further scheme administrator repeat the process. When you have associated all the scheme administrators that need to be associated to that pension scheme select ‘Go to submit’.</li>
  <li>Enter your User ID and password and select ‘Submit’. You’ll see a ‘Submission in progress’ screen. Do not attempt to resubmit the information or close your browser at this point. After a couple of minutes you’ll see the ‘Submission successful’ screen. The scheme administrators are now associated to the scheme.</li>
  <li>The status of the new scheme administrators will be shown as ‘Associated’. After 24 hours the new scheme administrators will be able to add themselves to the scheme by following the process in section 2.3.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Authorise a practitioner</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>About authorised practitioners</h3>
<p>A scheme administrator of a registered pension scheme can authorise a practitioner to deal with the day to day affairs of the pension scheme. Anyone the scheme administrator wants HMRC to deal with or to give information to — including access to the scheme records — will need to be authorised as a practitioner on Pension schemes online. This is important as HMRC will use the online service to send notifications to the practitioner if they authorised to receive information. If the practitioner’s details are not available HMRC will not be able to confirm their identity or deal with them.</p>

<p>HMRC requires authority from a scheme administrator before a practitioner can submit information to HMRC online. It is acceptable for a practitioner to submit a report or return on behalf of a scheme administrator provided that before they submit the report or return they have the approval of the scheme administrator to both the content of the report and to the submission. This is necessary as they will need to declare that the scheme administrator named in the submission has approved the content of the report or return and its submission. A practitioner will be unable to go online to see any information relating to the pension scheme or make amendments to any report or return for that scheme that has been submitted by anyone else unless authority to do so has been granted from the scheme administrator on Pension schemes online.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Authorise a practitioner</h3>
<p>To authorise a practitioner you’ll need their 8-digit practitioner ID. You’ll only be able to authorise a practitioner with a practitioner ID beginning with ‘0’.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fonline.hmrc.gov.uk%2Fhome" rel="external">Pension schemes online</a> start page sign in using your user name and password.</li>
  <li>Select ‘View account’ under ‘Pension schemes online for Administrators’.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Pension scheme for administrators product’ under the heading ‘File forms and returns’ (top-right box). You’ll be taken to the ‘Pension schemes online welcome page’.</li>
  <li>Select either ‘View all pension schemes’ from the left toolbar — this will give you a list of all the schemes you are added to as the scheme administrator, or you use the ‘Select a pension scheme’ function from the bottom-left box if you know the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr> or submission reference.</li>
  <li>Either select the pension scheme you want or enter the <abbr title="Pension Scheme Tax Reference">PSTR</abbr>. The ‘Pension scheme summary’ page will then be displayed.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Practitioner management’ under the scheme administration link.</li>
  <li>Select ‘Authorise new practitioner’.</li>
  <li>Enter the practitioner ID and client reference (if known) and select ‘Next’. The client reference is not mandatory information. It is the reference that the practitioner uses to identify their client.</li>
  <li>If you’re authorising HMRC to deal with more than one practitioner repeat the process for each one.</li>
  <li>When all practitioners are listed select ‘Go to summary and submit’.</li>
  <li>Enter your User ID and password and select ‘Submit’. You’ll see a ‘Submission in progress’ screen. Do not attempt to resubmit the information or close your browser at this point. After a couple of minutes you’ll see the ‘Submission successful’ screen. The practitioners are now associated to the scheme but will not be able to access the scheme record for at least 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Provide your authorised practitioner with your scheme administrator ID as they need to enter it when submitting returns and reports on your behalf.</li>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Amend scheme administrator name</h2>
<p>Once registered, if you need to change the scheme administrator name, you’ll need to tell HMRC in writing to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>

Pension Schemes Services 
<br>HM Revenue and Customs 
<br>BX9 1GH 
<br>
</p></div></div>

<p>You’ll need to include in your letter:</p>

<ul>

  <li>scheme administrator ID</li>
  <li>new scheme administrator name</li>
  <li>reason for the change</li>
  <li>contact name, address and telephone number</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot change the name of a scheme administrator registered as an individual to another individual’s name.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Mandatory online filing</h2>
<p>To prevent you losing data we recommend that there’s only one:</p>

<ul>
  <li>person working on a form at any one time</li>
  <li>instance of a form open at a time</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Forms that must be filed on Pension schemes online</h3>
<p>It’s mandatory to file certain forms and returns electronically. You must use Pension schemes online to file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accounting for tax returns</li>
  <li>scheme administrator’s declaration</li>
  <li>Event Reports</li>
  <li>notification of winding-up of a registered pension scheme</li>
  <li>notification of termination of a scheme administrator’s appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>A notice to file a Pension Scheme Return (<abbr title="Pension Scheme Return">PSR</abbr>) should not be confused with the requirement to file a Self Assessment <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-tax-return-for-trustees-of-registered-pension-schemes-sa970">form SA970</a> which is the tax return for schemes that have been set up under trust.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>File online</h3>
<p>If you’re a scheme administrator you’ll need to be added to the scheme. If you’re the first administrator you should follow the instructions in section 2. If there’s more than one scheme administrator and the first has already been added on Pension schemes online then they’ll need to associate you as described in section 3.</p>

<p>If you’re a practitioner filing a return on behalf of the scheme administrator you’ll need to make a declaration before the submission can be accepted. This declaration confirms that the named administrator has approved the content and its submission. You’ll need the named person’s scheme administrator ID and they must be registered against the scheme on Pension schemes online.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Select the relevant pension scheme</h3>
