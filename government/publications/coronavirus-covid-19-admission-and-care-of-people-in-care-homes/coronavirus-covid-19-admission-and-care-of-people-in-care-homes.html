<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Admission and isolation of residents</h2>

<p>Care home managers have the absolute discretion to accept or decline a resident and whether to isolate that individual on admission. This section explains what to do when residents are discharged to a care home from another care facility or hospital. It also explains what to do when new residents are admitted to a care home from the community and sets out the self-isolation requirements.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1&nbsp;Admission </span> of residents from a care facility</h3>

<p>Newly admitted residents to a care home who are transferring from an interim care facility or transferring from another care home do not need to self-isolate upon arrival, subject to an individual risk assessment.</p>

<p>The individual risk assessments should take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person admitted has received at least 2 doses of the vaccine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>advice from the director of public health about community prevalence, including any variants of concern &nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person meets criteria for not needing to self-isolate following close contact with a COVID-19 case (see 1.8 below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the circumstances at the care home or interim care facility from which they are transferring, prior to admission<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the levels of transmission in the community within which the previous care home or care facility is situated<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person is subject to an enhanced testing regime consisting of a PCR test before admission (within 72 hours), a PCR test on the day of admission (day 0) and a further PCR test 7 days following admission (day 7). Daily rapid lateral flow testing until the day 7 PCR result has been received is recommended</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the COVID-19 outbreak management of the previous care home or care facility<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Regard should also be given to:</p>

  <li>the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ethical-framework-for-adult-social-care">ethical framework for adult social care</a>
</li>
  <li>the wellbeing duty in&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/section/1/enacted" class="govuk-link">section 1 of the Care Act 2014</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All decisions should be taken in light of general legal obligations, such as those under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Equality Act 2010</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, as applicable.</p>

<p>If the risk assessment shows that above conditions are not met, an incoming resident should self-isolate for 14 days. See 1.7 (below) for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> Admission of residents discharged from hospital</h3>

<p>Every individual in hospital who is ready for discharge to a care home must receive a COVID-19 PCR test result within 48 hours prior to discharge, except for those who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 and are within 90 days of their symptom onset or positive test date (if asymptomatic). The test result must be shared with the individual themselves, their key relatives or advocates, and the relevant care home provider in advance of the discharge taking place.</p>

<p>All individuals who test positive should be discharged to a designated setting in the first instance to see out their 14-day isolation period. The total 14-day isolation period can be shared across the hospital and a designated setting, if&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;practices are not breached. Please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/designated-settings-for-people-discharged-to-a-care-home/discharge-into-care-homes-designated-settings" class="govuk-link">designated settings guidance</a> for further information.</p>

<p>Individuals who receive a negative test result within 48 hours prior to discharge should be discharged to a care home where they will not be asked to self-isolate, unless they were discharged following an emergency admission (see below) or there is possible contact with a known outbreak in the part of the hospital where they were treated.</p>

<p>For further guidance on discharge, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hospital-discharge-service-policy-and-operating-model" class="govuk-link">hospital discharge service: policy and operating model</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings">guidance for stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients</a>. See also section 1.6 (below) for information for individuals who cannot be tested.</p>

<h4>Discharge following elective admissions</h4>

<p>Residents do not need to self-isolate following planned overnight hospital stays of any length, subject to an individual risk assessment.</p>

<p>The individual risk assessment should take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person admitted has received at least 2 doses of the vaccine and meets criteria for not needing to self-isolate following close contact with a COVID-19 case (see section 1.8 below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local guidance from the director of public health about community prevalence</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person had been in contact with a COVID-positive person  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person has received a negative PCR test result following their return to the care home â as a precaution, the care home resident should self-isolate until their result is received</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether there is possible contact with a known outbreak in the part of the hospital where they were treated</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These residents should also minimise contact with <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/who-is-at-high-risk-from-coronavirus/">people at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness</a>.</p>

<p>If the risk assessment shows that above conditions are not met, an incoming resident should self-isolate for 14 days. See section 1.7 (below) for further information.</p>

<h4>Discharge following emergency admission</h4>

<p>Residents discharged from hospital following an unplanned hospital stay should self-isolate for 14 days upon return to the care home.</p>

<p>Emergency admissions are deemed higher risk due to the increased likelihood that contact with people of unknown COVID status may be encountered during the hospital stay, during periods of high community transmission.</p>

<p>This advice remains under review, and it is our ambition that guidance on self-isolation following emergency overnight stays in hospital will be amended as soon as the data and evidence show it is safe.</p>

<h3>Discharge following an outbreak in the hospital</h3>

<p>If there is an outbreak in the part of the hospital where the resident stayed, they should self-isolate for 14 days in their room regardless of whether their overnight hospital stay was planned (elective) or unplanned. This is to prevent possible introduction of infection into the care home.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3&nbsp;Admission </span> of residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 90 days</h3>

<p>Anyone who has had a COVID-19 positive PCR test within the past 90 days<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" class="govuk-link" href="#fn:4">[footnote 4]</a></sup> should not be tested again before being discharged from hospital or a care facility if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have a normal immune response</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have completed their 14-day isolation period following the positive test result</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They can be discharged into a care home if they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>meet the clinical improvement criteria included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings" class="govuk-link">stepdown guidance</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have no new symptoms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>have no new COVID-19 exposure (see section 1.8 below)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a patient develops new COVID-19 symptoms prior to discharge, a clinical assessment should be made to determine subsequent onward movement. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings" class="govuk-link">stepdown guidance</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>

<p>If a person tested positive for COVID-19 more than 90 days ago, they should be tested again 48 hours prior to discharge. The result of this repeat test should be sent to the care home, For further guidance on discharge, please refer to the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hospital-discharge-service-guidance">hospital discharge service guidance</a>.</p>

<h4>Exemption from routine testing for individuals who have previously tested positive within 90 days</h4>

<p>If an individual has tested positive with a PCR or rapid lateral flow test, the testing they should undertake in the following 90 days may be different. Full guidance on what testing to undertake within 90 days of a positive PCR or lateral flow test result can be found in the management of staff guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4 </span> Admission of new residents from the community</h3>

<p>Residents admitted to a care home from the community will not need to complete a 14-day self-isolation period, subject to an individual risk assessment.</p>

<p>The individual risk assessments should take into account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>whether the person admitted has received at least 2 doses of the vaccine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>local guidance from the director of public health about community transmission of variants of concern is followed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the circumstances at the personâs home, prior to admission</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if the person is subject to an enhanced testing regime consisting of a PCR test before admission (within 72 hours), a PCR test on the day of admission (day 0<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5" class="govuk-link">[footnote 5]</a></sup>) and a further PCR test 7 days following admission (day 7). Additionally, we recommend daily rapid lateral flow testing until the day 7 PCR result has been received</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the individual has been in contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms during the previous 14 days, or if they have been required to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace. If a close contact has occurred, admission may be delayed until after the relevant period of isolation. Admission should not be delayed if there are safeguarding and welfare concerns (see 1.8 below)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a resident is required to self-isolate upon admission from the community, this should take place within the care home. Self-isolation should not take place within the residentâs own home or be shared between the residentâs own home and care home. This is because care home managers are not able to monitor isolation periods within the residentâs own home. See section 1.7 (below) for further information on self-isolation in care homes.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.5&nbsp;Urgent </span> admissions from the community</h3>

<p>For urgent admissions (regardless of symptoms), the individual should be tested upon arrival and care home managers should follow the isolation guidance, set out in section 1.7 below.</p>

<p>The care home manager should also find out whether they have had a PCR test and if so, when and what the result was.</p>

<p>If the individual has taken a PCR test within 72 hours of the urgent admission into the care home, the care home manager must share the result with the care homeâs named clinical lead.</p>

<p>If a PCR test has not been taken or was taken more than 72 hours before urgent admission, the individual should be tested. The care home manager has the discretion to decide which form of testing (rapid lateral flow or PCR) they want to use.</p>

<p>The care home manager should work with the named clinical lead assigned to the care home to access a test kit and ensure the individual can appropriately self-isolate. The care home manager could utilise testing capacity from the NHS Test and Trace (National Testing Programme (pillar 2)), local testing capacity or an alternative as they see fit. If the care home manager feels local pillar 1 testing capacity is most appropriate, they should contact their local director of public health and organise testing using available capacity.</p>

<p>If the test result is positive, the care home manager should inform the individuals GP and then follow the same standard procedures for the admission of residents with COVID-19. This means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>that the resident must undergo a 14-day period of isolation within their own room</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>informing the local&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/pulse-oximetry-to-detect-early-deterioration-of-patients-with-covid-19-in-primary-and-community-care-settings/" class="govuk-link">closely monitoring the residentâs symptoms</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the test is negative, the care home manager should conduct a risk assessment to assess the need to continue self-isolation. The risk assessment should include information about risk and exposure prior to admission, and vaccination status. If the individual is fully vaccinated, refer to section 1.8 of this guidance (below).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.6 </span> Admission of residents who cannot be tested</h3>

<p>If residents cannot undergo testing, they should be assumed to be potentially infectious. Their COVID-19 status is unknown, and they should self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution. As designated settings are only for those who test positive for COVID-19, residents who cannot undergo testing should self-isolate within the care home, to minimise the risk of the spread of infection which could cause serious harm to people at higher risk of the COVID-19 illness.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7&nbsp;Self-isolation </span> in care homes</h3>

<p>Residents in care homes should self-isolate for 14 days. This is a precautionary approach for those with underlying health conditions which may affect their immune system.</p>

<p>All residents must self-isolate if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they test positive for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they have symptoms of COVID-19 and are awaiting a PCR test result to confirm their COVID-19 status (if they receive a negative PCR test, they no longer need to self-isolate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are a contact of a person with COVID-19 and are required to self-isolate while waiting for a PCR test result (see section 1.8 below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they are a contact of a person with COVID-19 and are required to self-isolate because they have not had at least 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>they attend a high risk visit outside of the home or have been discharged following an unplanned overnight hospital stay</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>following a risk assessment, are required to self-isolate due to one of the reasons outlined in section 1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Residents who have confirmed or suspected flu should self-isolate until fully recovered and for at least 5 days after the symptoms started. Residents with other respiratory viral infections should isolate as per flu unless they are advised otherwise by their <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>.</p>

<p>During their isolation period, residents should be supported to leave their room to go outdoors if the care home has outside space, without restarting their isolation period. Outdoors in this context means within the boundaries of the care homeâs grounds and should not involve contact with any other resident. This is subject to carefully considered risk assessments that take into account the safety of the resident and other residents within the care home. Care homes can take steps to mitigate risks, for example, by having staff accompany residents when they go outdoors.</p>

<p>For outdoor visits to occur safely, care homes should ensure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the resident can safely transit through the care home without mixing with other residents</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the route to get outdoors is well ventilated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>while outdoors, the resident does not mix with other residents and maintains a distance of at least 2 metres</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>staff or essential care givers accompanying residents wear <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as per requirements for indoors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are sufficient staff on duty to safely manage outdoor visits</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Residents in self-isolation should not use communal areas, including shared lavatories and bathrooms. Measures should be taken to manage symptoms and keep the resident as comfortable as possible. This may include medicines which will need to be prescribed and monitored by the residentâs GP.</p>

<h4>Visits from essential care givers during self-isolation</h4>

<p>During their period of self-isolation, residents can also receive visits from their essential care giver. However, when a care home resident or essential care giver has tested positive for COVID-19, visits should only be made in exceptional circumstances (for example, severe distress or end of life).</p>

<p>Visits during self-isolation periods should be limited to essential care givers only, apart from in exceptional circumstances such as end of life.</p>

<p>Essential care givers should be subject to the same testing requirements as staff and should follow appropriate guidance for using <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> in different care scenarios laid out in the guidance on&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">how to work safely in care homes</a>.</p>

<p>For further information on essential care givers, please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes">guidance for visiting arrangements in care homes</a>.</p>

<h4>Reablement care during self-isolation</h4>

<p>Individuals who are required to self-isolate on arrival to a care home from a hospital, whether they are returning residents or admitted as an interim placement, should be supported to engage in short-term therapy if it has been determined that they need it to aid their recovery and maximise their independence.&nbsp;This could include the provision of a paper copy of an exercise programme by the acute or community hospital with exercises for both upper and lower limbs.&nbsp;It is important to ensure these individuals are supported to regain and maintain their function during their isolation period.</p>

<h4>Supporting people who lack mental capacity</h4>

<p>Some residents may lack the relevant mental capacity needed to understand why they may need to self-isolate. These residents will fall under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Mental Capacity Act 2005</a>.</p>

<p>Providers should review their legal obligations under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in conjunction with (as applicable) the:</p>

</ul>

<p>See section 4 (below)&nbsp;for further information.</p>

<h4>Symptomatic and asymptomatic residents who have tested positive for COVID-19</h4>

<p>All symptomatic residents should immediately self-isolate and arrange to have a PCR test. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If the individual has tested positive for COVID-19, they must self-isolate from when their positive test result was available, from when their symptoms began if symptomatic, or if notified by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>Residents should continue their isolation until the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients">clinical improvement criteria</a>&nbsp;below have been met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>clinical improvement with at least some respiratory recovery</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>absence of fever (that is, greater than 37.8Â°C) for 48 hours without the use of medication</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no underlying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients#immsupp" class="govuk-link">severe immunosuppression</a>&nbsp;(reduced function of the immune system)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If possible and manageable, symptomatic residents and residents with confirmed COVID-19 should self-isolate in their own rooms. If this is not possible, symptomatic people who have not yet tested positive should be cohorted on separate floors or wings of the home so that they do not come into contact with other residents. See section 1.8 (below) for more information on cohorting.</p>

<p>Asymptomatic residents who test positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate immediately once their test result is known.</p>

<p>Residents who test positive using a rapid lateral flow test but do not have any of the main symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and the care home manager should report the result. Residents do not need to take a follow-up PCR test unless:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they wish to claim the Test and Trace Support Payment</li>
  <li>they have a health condition that means they may be suitable for new COVID-19 treatments</li>
  <li>they are taking lateral flow tests as part of research or surveillance programmes, and the programme asks them to do so</li>
  <li>they are an international arrival and have a positive day 2 lateral flow test&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>See section 2 (below) on testing for further information.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8 </span> Self-isolation of residents following close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case</h3>

<p>Residents who have received at least 2 doses of the vaccine and are identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 â whether Omicron or not â will not need to self-isolate. Instead, they should undertake:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a PCR test, taken after they became a contact â the resident should self-isolate until a negative PCR result is received</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>daily rapid lateral flow tests for 10 days</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Residents who cannot have a PCR test because they are within 90 days of a past COVID-19 infection should undertake daily rapid lateral flow tests.&nbsp;If the rapid lateral flow test is positive, see section 1.7 (above) for more information.</p>

<p>For residents who cannot comply with daily rapid lateral flow tests, an individual risk assessment is advised to balance infection control risks and personal welfare concerns. The individual risk assessment should take into account whether:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>less frequent testing could be tolerated</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contact can be limited with those who are particularly at higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>During this period, they should continue to follow all outbreak measures in the event of an outbreak, even where they have tested negative.</p>

<p>Residents who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated should self-isolate for 14 days. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a> guidance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9 </span> Cohorting residents during their period of self-isolation</h3>

<p>If a resident with a confirmed infection is required to self-isolate and they cannot be cared for in their own room it may be possible to safely care for them in a cohort with other similar residents.</p>

<p>It is important that only residents with the same confirmed infection are cohorted together, for example residents with confirmed COVID-19 must not be cohorted with residents with confirmed influenza.</p>

<p>It is preferable to have separate staff for cohorted residents.</p>

<p>During outbreak situations Health Protection Teams may give additional advice regarding cohorting.</p>

<p>In all circumstance residents with suspected or confirmed infections should not be placed next to immunocompromised residents.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.10&nbsp;Self-isolation </span> after international travel</h3>

<p>Due to the vulnerability of others within the care home, residents returning to the care home following travel outside of the UK should minimise contact with people at higher risk of severe disease if they were to be infected.</p>

<p>For individuals returning from a non-red list country, see guidance on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-to-england-from-another-country-during-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">travel to England from another country during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="number">2.&nbsp;Testing </span></h2>

<p>The safety of care home residents and staff is a priority, and testing is a crucial part of protecting them, by helping to prevent and control outbreaks.</p>

<p>For a summary of the type of testing available for staff, residents, visitors and visiting professionals in social care settings, see âCOVID-19 testing available for adult social care in England: a summaryâ on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-adult-social-care-settings" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for adult social care settings</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="number">3.&nbsp;Vaccinations </span></h2>

<h3><span class="number">3.1&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;vaccines </span></h3>

<p>The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.&nbsp;Large clinical trials have been undertaken for each of the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the UK,&nbsp;which found that they are highly efficacious at preventing symptomatic disease in the populations that were&nbsp;studied (see the week 41 report in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-surveillance-reports">COVID-19 vaccine weekly surveillance reports</a>).</p>

<p>A booster vaccine provides additional and strong protection against symptomatic COVID infection, such as from the new Omicron variant. Every eligible adult in England has now had the chance to get a lifesaving COVID-19 booster, as the government and NHS hit their target to offer the booster jab to those aged 18 and over by the New Year.</p>

<p>Primary care teams are delivering boosters directly to care home staff and residents within settings. While most eligible care home residents have already received their booster vaccine, protecting the most vulnerable is our top priority and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is committed to maximise the numbers of people offered the booster. To accelerate the rate at which care home residents are being vaccinated, the vaccination programme will ensure that all homes will get the visits they need to ensure everybody has the chance to access vaccination.</p>

<p>Social care workers can book a vaccination slot online through the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/">national booking service</a>&nbsp;or attend a <a rel="external" href="http://www.nhs.uk/grab-a-jab" class="govuk-link">walk-in centre</a> to receive their booster vaccine. All eligible frontline social care workers who have not already had their COVID-19 vaccine can also access their first and second doses via these routes. Providers have been given access to funding via the Infection Control Fund to pay staff their full wages to attend a vaccination facility for the purposes of being vaccinated. They can also help cover costs associated with reaching a vaccination facility.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Flu vaccines</h3>

<p>The flu vaccination programme is now running. We would encourage people, if eligible, to get their flu vaccine, which protects people from serious complications from flu. See the NHS website for more <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/flujab" rel="external" class="govuk-link">information on the flu vaccination</a>.</p>

<p>Frontline social care workers who are employed by registered residential or home care providers, voluntary managed hospice providers, as well as those employed through Direct Payment and/or Personal Health Budgets to deliver domiciliary care to people are eligible for a free flu vaccination this winter for those who are unable to get the vaccine through their employer. For further information, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flu-immunisation-for-social-care-staff" class="govuk-link">guidance on flu vaccinations</a> for social care workers.</p>

<span class="number">4.2&nbsp;Supporting </span> existing residents who may require hospitalisation</h3>

<p>If you think a resident may need to be transferred to hospital for urgent or essential treatment, for COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 related conditions, consider the following checklist. In a medical emergency the care home should dial 999.</p>

<h4>Checklist to assess the appropriateness of hospitalisation</h4>

<p>To assess the appropriateness of hospitalisation, the care home should:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.3&nbsp;Care </span> for individual needs</h3>

<h4>Mental Capacity Act</h4>

<p>Some care home residents, including those admitted from hospitals and the community, may lack the relevant mental capacity to make decisions about arrangements for their care and treatment. This might include people with dementia or people with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>These groups of people fall under the empowering framework of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (<abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>) and are protected by its safeguards, including the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (<abbr title="Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards">DoLS</abbr>).</p>

<p>If care home staff think a resident lacks the relevant mental capacity to make necessary decisions about their ongoing care and treatment, including testing, a capacity assessment should be carried out. This should be done before any decisions about their discharge from hospital and admission to a care home are made.</p>

<p>Please refer to The Social Care Institute of Excellence (<abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>) for <a href="https://www.scie.org.uk/mca/practice/care-planning/monitoring-implementation" rel="external" class="govuk-link">guidance on implementing the Mental Capacity Act</a>, specifically to support care homes in doing this.</p>

<h4>Dementia and learning disability</h4>

<p>People with dementia or a learning disability, autistic people and people experiencing serious mental ill health are likely to experience particular difficulties during the pandemic. This could include difficulty in understanding and following advice on self-isolation and increased anxiety. They may need additional support to recognise and respond to symptoms quickly, and in some cases may be at greater risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19. The government has worked with the&nbsp;<abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>&nbsp;to provide additional guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults" class="govuk-link">care staff supporting adults with learning disabilities and autistic adults</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5.&nbsp;Caring </span> for residents with COVID-19 and outbreak management</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1&nbsp;Keeping </span> residents without symptoms safe and monitoring symptom development</h3>

<p>Care home providers should follow relevant government guidance for everyone in their care home.</p>

<p>Care home residents (including older and younger residents with a learning disability, and autistic people) may not present with the typical COVID-19 symptoms of a cough or fever. They may also not be able to report a loss of taste or smell.</p>

<p>It is important to assess residents twice daily for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the development of a high temperature (37.8Â°C or above)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a cough</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to look for softer signs, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>shortness of breath</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if residents are less alert</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if residents have a new onset of confusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if residents are off food</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if residents have reduced fluid intake, diarrhoea or vomiting</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Care home providers and staff should consider COVID-19 as the possible cause of any worsening in physical or mental ability when there is no other known cause.</p>

<p>Through NHS âmutual aidâ, the NHS will be supporting care home professionals to use well evaluated tools such as&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.hampshiresouthamptonandisleofwightccg.nhs.uk/your-health/restore-official" class="govuk-link">RESTORE2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/clinical-policy/sepsis/nationalearlywarningscore/" class="govuk-link">NEWS2</a>&nbsp;(supported in current&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/covid-19-managing-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">British Geriatric Society (<abbr title="British Geriatric Society">BGS</abbr>) guidance</a>).</p>

<p>Staff should immediately report residents with these symptoms or signs to the&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, as outlined in sections 5.3 and 5.4 below.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Support caring for residents who test positive for COVID-19</h3>

<p>Pulse oximeters will be available to care homes via their named clinical lead, or local&nbsp;<abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>, as part of COVID oximetry at home. One oximeter per 10 beds with a minimum of 2 oximeters per home is recommended. Equipment which is used to support the monitoring of residents will need to meet infection control and decontamination standards and guidance.</p>

<p>The Care Provider Alliance has produced guidance on&nbsp;<a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://careprovideralliance.org.uk/coronavirus-oximetry-at-home-guidance-for-care-homes">COVID oximetry at home</a>. Health Education England and West of England AHSN have also produced&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/Component/Details/679015" class="govuk-link">training and support for care home staff using pulse oximetry</a>.</p>

<p>Care homes should have a weekly check-in with the homeâs <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr> or multidisciplinary team, who can support staff to understand the RESTORE2 and NEWS2 scoring system as a way of monitoring residents with symptoms. Should a patientâs symptoms worsen, it is important to contact NHS 111 or the registered GP for a clinical assessment either by phone or face to face.</p>

<p>The residentâs GP should give further advice on escalation and ensuring decisions are made in the context of the residentâs advance care plan. In a medical emergency, the care home should dial 999.</p>

<p>If symptoms worsen during isolation or are no better after 7 days, contact NHS 111 or the named clinician for the care home. In case of a medical emergency, dial 999.</p>

<p>If a resident has tested positive with a PCR test, <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/covid-19-testing-schedule-for-a-suspected-or-confirmed-outbreak-in-a-care-home">they should not be tested using either PCR or rapid lateral flow tests for 90 days</a>, unless they develop new symptoms during this time â in which case they should be retested immediately using PCR. This 90-day period is from the initial onset of symptoms or, if asymptomatic when tested, their positive test result.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3&nbsp;Outbreak </span> management</h3>

<h4>Reporting COVID-19 cases</h4>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19, or clinically suspected cases of COVID-19, among people in the same specific setting, with the onset of symptoms within 14 days. For more detailed guidance on the definitions of outbreaks please see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-epidemiological-definitions-of-outbreaks-and-clusters">COVID-19: epidemiological definitions of outbreaks and clusters in particular settings</a>&nbsp;guidance.</p>

<p>If a new case (confirmed or suspected) is identified in a care home (not a discharged COVID-19 positive case diagnosed in hospital), the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> should be informed. A risk assessment should be undertaken with the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> and local partners to see what measures are required to prevent or control an outbreak. These will include testing and may also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>temporarily stopping or reducing communal activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>closure of the home to further admissions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changes to visiting: some forms of visiting, including from essential care givers, should continue if individual risk assessments are carried out. See guidance on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">visiting arrangements in care homes</a>&nbsp;for further details</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In specific situations, where the local or national risk assessment indicates that cases may be caused by a variant with vaccine escape potential or other concerns, additional measures could be considered including self-isolation of fully vaccinated contacts for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak in a care home, outbreak restrictions will be in place for different lengths of time, depending on the characteristics of the outbreak and the results of outbreak testing.</p>

<p>See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes">Coronavirus (COVID-19) testing in adult care homes</a> for full guidance on care home COVID-19 testing, including guidance on the outbreak testing process. The process will usually be as follows and your <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will advise if a different approach is needed based on the specific circumstances of the outbreak.</p>

<p>All staff and residents should be tested with rapid lateral flow and PCR on day 1 of a new outbreak, and once again between days 4 and 7.</p>

<p>If these tests do not detect any further cases in residents or staff, then outbreak control restrictions may be lifted following a risk assessment by the health protection team. This may mean that outbreak measures may only be in place for about 7 days (depending on PCR turnaround times), if there is no evidence of further transmission within the care home.</p>

<p>Otherwise, outbreak recovery testing should be undertaken when there have been 14 days with no new cases. If no new cases are found, the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will usually advise that outbreak restrictions can then be lifted.</p>

<p>If the outbreak involves a particular variant which requires additional mitigations (this does not include Alpha, Delta or Omicron), outbreak recovery testing should take place once there have been 28 days with no new cases, rather than 14 days. The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will contact the care home if a variant is identified in the care home which requires these different measures.</p>

<h4>Reporting flu cases &nbsp;</h4>

<p>A flu outbreak is defined as at least one laboratory confirmed case of influenza and one or more cases which meet the clinical case definition of an influenza like illness, among individuals (residents or staff) with an epidemiological link to the care home, arising within the same 48-hour period.</p>

<p>If an outbreak is suspected in a care home, this should be reported to the local&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>&nbsp;immediately. They will undertake an initial risk assessment, provide advice on outbreak management, and decide what testing is needed. Local&nbsp;<abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr>&nbsp;will also inform their local partners of the situation.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6.&nbsp;Care </span> for people at the end of life and after death</h2>

<p>Care at the end of life for residents, regardless of the cause of their deterioration, should be provided in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-care-pathway-review-response-to-recommendations" class="govuk-link">5 Priorities for Care</a>.</p>

<p>Each resident should receive personalised care, including an individualised care and support plan that outlines their individual needs and preferences. This includes explicit consideration of food and fluids, symptom management and psychological, social and spiritual support.</p>

<p>Residents should be asked, where possible, if they would like to be visited by loved ones and/or a faith leader. Care home staff should inform the residentâs family and those important to them about what is happening and offer the opportunity to visit.</p>

<p>More information on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">ensuring compassionate visiting for people at the end of life in care homes can be found in the guidance on care home visiting</a>.</p>

<p>Any advance care decision, including do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr>) decisions, should be made on an individual basis. These decisions should be fully discussed with the individual and their family, and should be signed by the responsible clinician. It is unacceptable for advance care plans, including&nbsp;<abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr>&nbsp;decisions, to be applied in a blanket fashion to any group of people.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>&nbsp;will urgently raise cases of inappropriate use of&nbsp;<abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr> with relevant bodies, including the General Medical Council, and take action where registered providers are responsible. See the&nbsp;<a rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/do-not-attempt-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-dnacpr-decisions/" class="govuk-link">guidance relating to&nbsp;<abbr title="do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation">DNACPR</abbr>&nbsp;decisions</a>.</p>

<p>After death, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">guidance on <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions</a> continue to apply. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact, even though the risk is usually lower than from those living.

<h2>
<span class="number">7.&nbsp;Advice </span> on keeping staff safe</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1&nbsp;Infection </span> prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) and personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures should continue to be practised in care homes to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and other infections including flu. This includes regular cleaning, ventilation, limiting social contact and hand hygiene.</p>

<p>The government has worked with care sector representative bodies to produce tailored&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;guidance</a> for care homes, in addition to illustrated guides for the correct order of&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">putting on&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking off&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>When health and social care workers, essential care givers and other professionals visit care homes, they should&nbsp;wear appropriate&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;and follow all relevant&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;guidance. It is essential that&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;is used correctly and regardless of whether the person being cared for has symptoms of COVID-19, or whether they or the care worker have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>The government has committed to the provision of free&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;for COVID-19 needs until the end of March 2022.&nbsp;<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered providers can access this through the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;portal</a>&nbsp;and non&nbsp;<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered providers via their&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers">local resilience forum (<abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr>) or local authority where&nbsp;<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>&nbsp;have stood down regular distribution of&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>As it is possible for asymptomatic people to pass on COVID-19 to others, care home providers should continue to limit all staff movement between settings. See the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings/restricting-workforce-movement-between-care-homes-and-other-care-settings" class="govuk-link">restricting workforce movement&nbsp;between care homes and other care settings</a>. Care homes are supported to do this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-extension-to-infection-control-and-testing-fund-2021" class="govuk-link">extension to the Infection Control and Testing Fund</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Staff vaccination</h3>

<p>Since 11 November 2021, <a rel="external" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/891/contents/made" class="govuk-link">The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2021</a> requires care home providers to only deploy individuals who are fully vaccinated, unless they are exempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Individuals working or volunteering in care homes are also advised to apply for a formal COVID-19 medical exemption by ringing 119 and requesting an NHS COVID Pass medical exemption application form.&nbsp;Since 24 December 2021, this is the only means of demonstrating medical exemption. For more information, see:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3&nbsp;Self-isolation </span> for adult social care staff</h3>

<h4>Staff who test positive for COVID-19 or develop symptoms</h4>

<p>For advice on staff who test positive for COVID-19 or develop symptoms, see the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a>. This guidance also provides further information on ending isolation before the end of 10 days for staff who develop COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive on a rapid lateral flow or PCR test.</p>

<h4>Staff who are identified as a close contact of COVID-19</h4>

<p>Staff who have received at least 2 doses of the vaccine and are identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 â whether Omicron or not â will not need to self-isolate. They can continue to work provided they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>have received a negative PCR test after they have become a contact (the result of this PCR test should be negative prior to returning to work)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>receive daily negative lateral flow tests for the remainder of the 10-day isolation period.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For a definition of a âclose contactâ, see annex A.</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to how to ensure staff can deliver safe care during the 10 days after being identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. This includes applying the measures known to reduce risk such as distancing, maximising ventilation, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, cohorting, and enhanced testing of COVID-contacts.</p>

<p>This should be built into care homesâ general risk assessments for responding to infectious diseases and ensuring safe staffing levels are maintained. Where possible, staff should be redeployed for 10 days following contact with a positive COVID-19 case to parts of the home or service where contact with people who are at higher risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19 can be minimised. Recognising this may be challenging in adult social care settings.</p>

<p>If an unvaccinated or partially vaccinated staff member is notified as a contact of a COVID-19 case, by NHS Test and Trace or their workplace, they must self-isolate as advised unless exempt (that is, for medical reasons or if the person is under the age of 18). If a staff member is unvaccinated and is exempt from self-isolation in the community, they should not attend work, or should be redeployed for the period of time they would be required to self-isolate.</p>

<p>For information on how long staff should isolate for, including when they can end their self-isolation period, see the guidance on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4&nbsp;Staff </span> testing: symptomatic and asymptomatic testing</h3>

<p>Staff should continue to take part in the regular asymptomatic testing regimes for their setting. For care home staff, this is outlined in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-adult-care-homes/covid-19-care-home-testing-guidance-for-regular-and-outbreak-testing-of-staff-and-residents" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 care home testing guidance for regular and outbreak testing of staff and residents</a>. Staff who test negative for COVID-19 and do not have symptoms at the time of the test can continue working.</p>

<p>A symptomatic individual who tests negative for COVID-19 may have another infectious illness like flu and actions to limit transmission may be needed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Staff returning from international travel</h3>

<p>Staff should take a cautious approach to international travel. For information on testing following international travel, including what to so if you test positive, see guidance on:</p>

This provides advice and resources on maintaining mental wellbeing and how employers can take care of the wellbeing of their staff during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8.Advice </span> for care home managers</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>Care homes should report vacancies (bed capacity) in the Capacity Tracker. This data will be shared with local resilience forums&nbsp;(<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>)&nbsp;in the daily national situation reports to support capacity planning and response.</p>

<p>Local authorities will also use this information to inform their care home support plans. Hospital discharge teams rely on this information being kept up to date to quickly find vacancies across the country.</p>

<p>If care home providers think there are imminent risks to the continuity of care, such as the potential closure of a service or insufficient staff to safely meet peopleâs needs, they should raise this with the local authority immediately.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Review sick leave policies and occupational health support</h3>

<p>Care home managers should review sick leave policies and occupational health support for care home staff. They should also support unwell staff to stay at home as per guidance for household isolation. Support for employers can be found at&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19">working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p>Staff may be ill due to reasons other than COVID-19 and may need to follow specific return to work procedures. For example, staff may be off due to diarrhoea and vomiting, in which case they should wait 48 hours before returning to work.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3. </span> Provide appropriate training and support</h3>

<p>Ensure staff are provided with appropriate training and support to continue providing care to all residents, including&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;training. Employers can access rapid&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/COVID-19-Essential-training.aspx">online induction training</a> for new staff, new volunteers and refresher modules for their workforce. The training includes key elements of the Care Certificate and is available free of charge where accessed directly through Skills for Care.</p>

<p>If required, managers should contact the directors of nursing in&nbsp;<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;training support. Providers can also access support with the costs of training for their workforce through the Workforce Development Fund (WDF). More detail is available on <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/Learning-development/Funding/Workforce-Development-Fund/Workforce-Development-Fund.aspx">Skills for Careâs Workforce Development Fund webpage</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Business continuity policy</h3>

<p>All care homes should have a business continuity policy in place including a plan for surge capacity for staffing, which in turn should include using&nbsp;mutual aid,&nbsp;which is built into&nbsp;contingency and emergency incident plans at a local authority and a NHS level. In these circumstances, other homes may take the residents, or the NHS may provide additional support in the form of registered nurses.&nbsp;More information on developing contingency plans for adult social care services is available from&nbsp;<a href="https://careprovideralliance.org.uk/assets/pdfs/cpa_contingency_planning_guidance_180612.pdf" class="govuk-link" rel="external">the Care Provider Alliance</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">9.&nbsp;National </span> support available to implement this guidance</h2>

<p>On 29&nbsp;December 2021, we announcedâ¯an additional Â£60 million for local authorities to help them support the adult social care response to COVID-19 in January. The Omicron Support Fund is on top of the Â£388 million <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-extension-to-infection-control-and-testing-fund-2021" class="govuk-link">Infection Control and Testing Fund</a> announced&nbsp;in October 2021&nbsp;to prevent infections and&nbsp;support&nbsp;testing to the care sector. This grant is available until 31 March 2022 and can be used to support community care providers to take key infection prevention and control and testing measures, as set out in the grant conditions.</p>

<p>Providers can use the Infection Control and Testing Fund to pay full wages to staff who are not required to self-isolate but are asked not to work (for example, when a staff member who has received at least 2 doses of the vaccine is awaiting the result of a PCR test following notification of a close contact), in line with government guidance. This fund does not apply to those who cannot work due to non-compliance with the vaccine as a condition of deployment regulations (unless exemptions apply).</p>

<p>On 10 December 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> announced an additional Â£300 million to support local authorities working with providers to further boost staffing and support existing care work through the winter. This new funding is in addition to the existing Â£162.5 million Workforce Recruitment and Retention Fund announced on 21 October.</p>

<p>On 3 November 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-coronavirus-covid-19-winter-plan-2021-to-2022">Adult social care: winter plan 2021 to 2022</a>. This was developed in conjunction with the NHS and social care sector stakeholders. We have drawn on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the recommendations of Sir David Pearsonâs review of last yearâs ASC winter plan</li>
  <li>advice from <abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr> and <abbr title="UK Health Security Agency">UKHSA</abbr>
</li>
  <li>extensively, lessons learned so far in the pandemic</li>
</ul>

<p>The winter plan sets out the actions national government will be taking to support the sector, along with the steps local authorities, the NHS and care providers should take to prevent and control both COVID-19 outbreaks and other respiratory viruses.</p>

<p>On 30 September 2021, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> also announced a Â£478 million funding package to continue the hospital discharge programme until 31 March 2022. This will grant staff the resources needed to support patients to leave hospital as quickly and as safely as possible with the support.</p>

<p>To help local authorities maintain all their work to deal with the impact of the pandemic, we have committed over Â£6 billion to councils through un-ringfenced grants to tackle the impact of COVID-19 on their services, including adult social care.</p>

<p>The Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has provided further detail on the funding arrangements in the&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-emergency-funding-for-local-government">Coronavirus (COVID-19): emergency funding for local government in 2020 to 2021 and additional support in 2021 to 2022</a>.</p>

<h2>Annex A: definitions of COVID-19 cases and contacts</h2>

<p>A close contact, as defined in The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020, means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>having face-to-face contact with someone at a distance of less than one metre</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>spending more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of an individual</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>travelling in a car or other small vehicle with an individual, or in close proximity to an individual on an aeroplane</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is advised that social care providers also take a wider meaning of contact as below.</p>

<p>A âcontactâ is a person who has been in close contact to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can be a close contact any time from 2 days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms, and up to 14 days after, as this is when they can pass the infection on to others. A risk assessment may be undertaken to determine this, but a contact means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>anyone who lives in the same household as another person who has COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>anyone who has had any of the following types of contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>face-to-face contact including being coughed on or having a face-to-face conversation within one metre</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>been within one metre for one minute or longer without face-to-face contact</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>sexual contacts</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>travelled in the same vehicle or a plane<sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An interaction through a Perspex (or equivalent) screen with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 is not usually considered to be a contact, as long as there has been no other contact such as those in the list above.</p>

<p>If youâre a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 you will be notified by the NHS Test and Trace service via text message, email or phone and must follow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">guidance for contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 infection who do not live with the person</a>.</p>

<h3>Breaches of&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>&nbsp;at work</h3>

<p>In assessing whether a member of staff has had a breach of&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, a risk assessment should be done in conjunction with local&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;policy. The following factors should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the length of exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the proximity of the resident</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the activities that took place when the worker was in proximity (for example, aerosol generating procedures (<abbr title="aerosol generating procedures">AGPs</abbr>), monitoring, personal care)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>whether the member of staffâs eyes, nose or mouth were exposed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the risk assessment concludes there has been a significant breach, or close contact without&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the worker should remain off work for 10 days from the day after exposure.</p>

<p>Examples that are unlikely to be considered breaches include if a health or social care worker was not wearing gloves for a short period of time or their gloves tore, and they washed their hands immediately, or if their apron tore while caring for a resident, and this was replaced promptly. The local health protection team or local&nbsp;<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>&nbsp;lead can support a risk assessment if required.</p>

<p>This advice applies to all individuals present in a care environment if they are following instructions from that institution.</p>

<div role="doc-endnotes" class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>Where there is an outbreak in the other care facility, the transfer should only take place in exceptional circumstances. Should there be known infection in the other accommodation, a risk assessment should be undertaken and transfer should only occur if the risk of that person remaining in the other accommodation is greater than for them to move into the care home. If the decision is taken to continue with the transfer, the resident should self-isolate upon arrival.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" aria-label="go to where this is referenced" role="doc-backlink" href="#fnref:1">â©</a></p>
    </li>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>The associated risk level of transmission within a community is dependent on a number of factors, including population levels of the given area. Care home managers should get in touch with their local health protection team when assessing if the number of cases within the community in which the care home is situated constitutes as âhigh riskâ.&nbsp;<a role="doc-backlink" aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link" href="#fnref:2">â©</a></p>

    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This may include assessing the previous settingâs susceptibility to COVID-19 outbreaks; the previous settingâs inadequate understanding of risk factors; non-adherence to setting guidance; management concerns such as staffing issues or lack of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>; significant media or political interest; any other significant implication.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:3" class="govuk-link" aria-label="go to where this is referenced" role="doc-backlink">â©</a></p>
    </li>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>A person can test positive for COVID-19 for up to 90 days after first being infected, even though they might have recovered and might not be infectious to others any more. This is because PCR tests can sometimes still detect remnants of COVID-19 (SARS-Co-V-2 RNA) in a personâs system.&nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" aria-label="go to where this is referenced" href="#fnref:4" role="doc-backlink">â©</a></p>
    </li>
    <li role="doc-endnote">
      <p>An individual does not need to self-isolate while waiting for the day 0 PCR, provided they had a negative 72 hours pre-admission test. Unless a local risk assessment indicates otherwise, the individual should not mix with people who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 while waiting for the result.&nbsp;<a role="doc-backlink" href="#fnref:5" aria-label="go to where this is referenced" class="govuk-link">â©</a></p>
