<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On 15 May 2020 the government published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-care-homes">support package for care homes</a> backed by a £600 million Adult Social Care Infection Control Fund. This is the next phase of our response for care homes, using the latest domestic and international evidence brought together by Public Health England (<abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>), and drawing on the insights of care providers.</p>

<p>This document updates the previous ‘Admission and care of residents during COVID-19 incident in a care home’ guidance published on 2 April 2020, in line with the support package for care homes and latest updated advice on testing, and infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>).</p>

<p>This guidance is for periods of sustained community transmission. It will be updated as the situation relating to the spread of and risk posed by coronavirus changes. Proprietors, managers, social workers, family members and relevant health professionals should check this guidance at regular intervals to ensure they’re viewing the most current version and should continue to keep the implementation of any locally adopted measures under review to ensure that they’re appropriate.</p>

<p>Care homes are a vital part of our health and social care system and we want to make sure you and your staff can continue to care for some of the most vulnerable to coronavirus (COVID-19) in our society.</p>

<p>We want to support care home providers to protect their staff and residents, ensuring that each person is getting the right care in the most appropriate setting for their needs. We know that to do this care homes need to have access to the right knowledge, staff and resources, so they’re equipped to deliver care in this challenging time.</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) has led on this guidance, with input and advice from NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr>), <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and the Care Quality Commission (<abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>). <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup></p>

<p>This guidance is intended for care homes, local health protection teams, local authorities, clinical commissioning groups (<abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>) and registered providers of accommodation for people who need personal or nursing care. This includes registered residential care and nursing homes for people with learning disabilities, mental health and/or other disabilities. This guidance has also been shared with <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> providers and GPs for information.</p>

<p>Please note that this guidance is of a general nature and that an employer should consider the specific conditions of each individual place of work and comply with all applicable legislation, including the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</p>

<p>Everyone with responsibility for the admission and care of care home residents must always be mindful of the needs and rights of those residents. This guidance should therefore be considered alongside the wellbeing principles outlined in the Care Act 2014, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ethical-framework-for-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">ethical framework for adult social care</a>, and relevant equalities-related legal and policy frameworks. Any assessment of a resident’s needs and subsequent decisions made must consider individual circumstances and ethical implications, ensuring that the resident is treated with respect so that their human rights, personal choices, safety and dignity are upheld. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">[footnote 2]</a></sup></p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> acknowledges that care home settings differ significantly. That is why care home managers and proprietors need to undertake a balanced risk assessment when considering the implementation of this guidance. This must consider the needs of all residents and staff in the care home to ensure that they’re taking timely and proportionate measures for each setting.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span> Admission, isolation and testing of residents</h2>

<p>The care sector looks after many of the people who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 in our society.</p>

<p>In this pandemic, we appreciate that care home providers are first and foremost looking after the people in their care and doing so while some of their staff are absent due to sickness or isolation or have taken the decision to shield. As part of the national effort, the care sector also plays a vital role in accepting patients as they’re discharged from hospital, because recuperation is better in non-acute settings. Residents may also be admitted to a care home from a home setting.</p>

<p>Some of these patients may have COVID-19, and as we learn more about the condition it can be difficult to distinguish symptoms of COVID-19 from other conditions of morbidity, whether they’re symptomatic or asymptomatic.</p>

<h3>Isolation of residents discharged from hospital or another social care facility</h3>

<p>To minimise the risk to residents in care homes during periods of sustained community transmission, all residents being discharged from hospital or interim care facilities to the care home, and new residents admitted from the community, should be isolated for 14 days within their own room. This should be the case unless they have already undergone isolation for a 14-day period in another setting, and even then, the care home may wish to isolate new residents for a further 14 days.</p>

<p>If new residents are admitted part way through an isolation period, they should as a minimum complete the remaining isolation period within their own room in the care home. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link">[footnote 3]</a></sup></p>

<p>A 14-day period of isolation is recommended for residents in care homes as older care home residents are a particularly vulnerable group and their immune response may differ from younger, normally healthier individuals.</p>

<p>People with dementia or a learning disability, autistic people, and people experiencing serious mental ill health are likely to experience particular difficulties during the pandemic. This could include difficulty in understanding and following advice on social distancing, and increased anxiety. They may need additional support to recognise and respond to symptoms quickly, and in some cases may be at greater risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19.</p>

<p>The government has worked with the Social Care Institute for Excellence (<abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>) to provide additional guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-care-staff-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults" class="govuk-link">care staff supporting adults with learning disabilities and autistic adults</a>.</p>

<p>For further guidance on discharge, please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hospital-discharge-service-guidance">hospital discharge service guidance</a> and guidance for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-within-hospitals-and-discharging-covid-19-patients-from-hospital-to-home-settings/guidance-for-stepdown-of-infection-control-precautions-and-discharging-covid-19-patients" class="govuk-link">stepdown of infection control precautions and discharging COVID-19 patients</a>.</p>

<p>This covers both patients who have recovered or are recovering from COVID-19. For advice on safe practices in a care home please see the guidance document <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">how to work safely in care homes</a>.</p>

<p>A small number of people may be discharged from hospital within the 14-day period from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms needing ongoing social care, but no longer needing in-patient care. They will have been COVID-19 tested and have confirmed COVID-positive status. Test results should be included in discharge documentation. They will also need to be isolated until they complete their 14-day recommended isolation period.</p>

<p>No care home will be forced to admit an existing or new resident to the care home if they are unable to cope with the impact of the person’s COVID-19 illness for the duration of the isolation period.</p>

<p>Some care providers will be able to accommodate these individuals through effective isolation strategies or cohorting policies. If appropriate isolation/cohorted care is not available with a local care provider, the individual’s local authority will be asked to secure alternative appropriate accommodation and care for the remainder of the required isolation period.</p>

<p>The government has made £1.3 billion available to support enhanced discharge from the NHS, and this funding can be drawn on for this alternative provision. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that there is sufficient alternative accommodation to quarantine and isolate residents as required. We expect local authorities to work together with the NHS to put this approach into practice, in accordance with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hospital-discharge-service-guidance" class="govuk-link">hospital discharge service guidance</a>. Please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan/covid-19-our-action-plan-for-adult-social-care#controlling-the-spread-of-infection-in-care-settings" class="govuk-link">adult social care action plan</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Where a test result is still awaited, the patient will be discharged and pending the result, isolated in the same way as every admission or transfer to a care home.</p>

<h3>Testing staff and residents in care homes</h3>

<p>Care homes are on the frontline in tackling COVID-19 and we are determined that staff will have everything they need to keep themselves and their residents safe. The safety of residents and staff is a priority, and testing is a crucial part of this. It helps to both prevent and control outbreaks and allows the right steps to be taken at the right time to reduce the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>As we have ramped up our testing capacity, we have continued to prioritise testing for care home staff and residents. All symptomatic social care workers, including care home staff, have been able to access a test since 8 April and <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> have been providing testing to support outbreak control in care homes since the start of the outbreak. We published the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan">adult social care action plan</a> on 15 April, which set out our commitment to test all residents prior to their admission to care homes, including on discharge from hospital and to expand outbreak testing to include all symptomatic residents.</p>

<p>We have since gone even further, with the government announcing on 28 April that testing would be expanded in the care sector to include both symptomatic and asymptomatic care home staff and residents. We have now made 50,000 tests per day available and launched the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home">care home portal</a> on 11 May to allow care home managers to request tests for all staff and residents – known as ‘whole home testing’.</p>

<p>We initially prioritised whole home testing for care homes that specialise in caring for older people and those living with dementia in line with advice from <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> and Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (<abbr title="Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies">SAGE</abbr>). We began rolling out whole home testing for care homes for older people and dementia from 6 June, and we extended this offer to all care homes on the 31 August.</p>

<p>We expect these to be largely specialist adult care homes catering for adults with learning disabilities or mental health issues, physical disabilities, acquired brain injuries and other categories for younger adults under 65 years. Expansion of testing to other care settings and retesting of care homes will be guided by clinical advice on relative priority and available testing capacity. The care home portal (see details below) should be checked for the latest advice on eligibility.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#care-home" class="govuk-link">Coronavirus (COVID-19): getting tested</a> page for further information, including additional guidance documents, instructional videos to support administration of tests and links to access testing.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>symptomatic care home workers (and anyone with symptoms that lives in the same household as a care home worker) can <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus">arrange a PCR test at</a> either a regional testing or mobile testing site, or choose to receive a home testing kit delivered direct to their door by visiting the online <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers" class="govuk-link">self-referral portal</a>
</li>
  <li>alternatively, employers can refer their symptomatic staff for a test via the employer-referral portal – further information is available via the link above and employers will need to email <a href="mailto:portalservicedesk@dhsc.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">portalservicedesk@dhsc.gov.uk</a> to obtain a login</li>
  <li>care home managers should contact their local health protection team (<abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>) if they suspect their care home has a new coronavirus outbreak and/or it has been 14 days or longer since the last case and there are new cases<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">[footnote 5]</a></sup>. <abbr title="health protection teams">HPTs</abbr> will provide advice and arrange the first tests and can be contacted using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team">form available on GOV.UK</a>
</li>
  <li>care home managers can apply for coronavirus testing kits to test residents and staff of their care home via the online <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-care-home">care home portal</a>. They can apply whether or not any of their residents or staff have coronavirus symptoms. Visit the care home portal for details of eligibility.</li>
  <li>care home residents will be tested as a matter of course prior to their discharge from hospital, and results should be included in discharge documentation</li>
  <li>if you cannot access resources online, please call 119 (in England and Wales)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How care homes can support the NHS Test and Trace service</h3>

<p>NHS Test and Trace is a key part of the government’s COVID-19 response. If we can rapidly detect people who have recently come into close contact with a COVID-19 case, we can take swift action to minimise transmission of the virus. This is important as lockdown measures are eased and will help us return to a more normal way of life and reduce the risk of needing local lockdowns in the future.</p>

<p>Full details on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works">how NHS Test and Trace works</a> are available.</p>

<p>Care homes should support NHS Test and Trace by keeping a temporary record of current and previous residents, visitors and staff. Many providers will already have the necessary record systems to store and provide this information on request. In these cases, providers do not need to duplicate records. If you do not currently have a system to record this information, this should be done in a way that is manageable for your business.</p>

<p>It is recommended that providers ensure that their systems are set up in such a way that this information can be reported rapidly on request and identify the person(s) who can produce this information at short notice.</p>

<p>If a care home is contacted, the following information about residents, previous residents, visitors and staff may be requested at short notice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for residents: names and contact details of current residents</li>
  <li>if a resident moves out of the care home, the care home should continue to keep a record of the resident, including:
    <ul>
      <li>resident’s name</li>
      <li>a contact phone number</li>
      <li>date of admission (if this took place within 21 days of their departure)</li>
      <li>date of departure or move to another setting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for visitors:
    <ul>
      <li>name (if there is more than one person, then you can record the name of the ‘lead member’ of the group and the number of people in the group as long as the lead visitors is able to support provision of more detailed information of their visiting group if needed)</li>
      <li>a contact phone number for each visitor, or for the lead member of a group of people</li>
      <li>date of visit</li>
      <li>arrival time and, where possible, departure time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>for staff:
    <ul>
      <li>the names of staff who work at the premises</li>
      <li>a contact phone number for each member of staff</li>
      <li>the dates and times that staff are at work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>NHS Test and Trace will ask for these records only where it is necessary.</p>

<h4>General Data Protection Regulation</h4>

<p>All collected data must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and should not be kept for longer than is necessary.</p>

<p>Any records or reports produced specifically for NHS Test and Trace should be held for 21 days. After 21 days, this information should be securely disposed of or deleted. When deleting or disposing of data, you must do so in a way that does not risk unintended access (for example, shredding paper documents and ensuring permanent deletion of electronic files).</p>

<p>Reports to NHS Test and Trace should not contain data that goes beyond what is requested.</p>

<p>GDPR allows you to request contact information from your staff and those receiving care and share it with NHS Test and Trace to help minimise the transmission of COVID-19 and support public health and safety. It is not necessary to seek consent from each person. If you already collect this information for ordinary business purposes, you should make staff and recipients of care aware that their contact information may now also be shared with NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>You do not have to inform every person individually. You might, for example, update the privacy notice on your website to add a section that sets out what data will be used for and the circumstances in which it might be accessed by NHS Test and Trace. You may need to offer some people additional support in accessing or understanding updates to your privacy policy.</p>

<p>For further information on what the Test and Trace system means for staff working in care homes, please see <a href="#section-5-advice-for-staff" class="govuk-link">section 5</a> (Test and Trace information for staff) and <a href="#annex-b" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a> for potential scenarios of staff contacts.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span> Caring for residents, depending on their COVID-19 status and particular needs</h2>

<p>When caring for residents, providers should pay regard to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-ethical-framework-for-adult-social-care" class="govuk-link">ethical framework for adult social care</a>, and the well-being duty in <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/section/1/enacted" class="govuk-link">section 1 of the Care Act 2014</a>.</p>

<p>For advice on caring for particular needs, please see the sections below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A. Keeping asymptomatic residents safe and monitoring symptom development</li>
  <li>B. Symptomatic residents</li>
  <li>C. Supporting existing residents who may require hospital care</li>
  <li>D. Management and isolation of residents exposed to a possible or confirmed COVID-19 case</li>
  <li>E. Primary care and community health services for residents</li>
  <li>F. Residents without relevant mental capacity</li>
</ul>

<h3>A. Keeping asymptomatic residents safe and monitoring symptom development</h3>

<p>Care home providers should follow relevant government guidance for everyone in the care home. For example, wherever possible care homes should be implementing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing measures</a>, and supporting individuals to follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19" class="govuk-link">shielding guidance</a> for the clinically extremely vulnerable group.</p>

<p>Care home residents (both older residents and younger residents with a learning disability or autistic people) may not present with the typical symptoms of cough or fever and may not be able to report a loss of taste or smell. It’s important to assess residents twice daily for the development of a high temperature (37.8°C or above), a cough, as well as for softer signs such as being short of breath, being not as alert, having a new onset of confusion, being off food, having reduced fluid intake, diarrhoea or vomiting.</p>

<p>Through NHS ‘mutual aid’ the NHS will be supporting care home professionals to use well evaluated tools such as <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://westhampshireccg.nhs.uk/restore2/">RESTORE2</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/clinical-policy/sepsis/nationalearlywarningscore/" class="govuk-link">NEWS2</a> (supported in current <a href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/covid-19-managing-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link" rel="external">British Geriatric Society (<abbr title="British Geriatric Society">BGS</abbr>) guidance</a>). This will be accompanied by support and access to specific equipment such as pulse oximeters, which can also help determine whether a resident is unwell. Equipment which is used to support the monitoring of residents will need to meet infection control and decontamination standards and guidance.</p>

<p>Any such changes could alert staff to the possibility of new COVID-19 infection. Staff should immediately report residents with these symptoms or signs to the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>, as outlined in the section below.</p>

<h3>B. Symptomatic residents</h3>

<p>Any resident presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 should be promptly isolated (if not already) and tested (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-d">Annex D</a> for further detail on infection control measures and <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-1-admission">section 1</a> for information on testing). This should be in a single room with a separate bathroom, where possible.</p>

<p>If the design and capacity of the care home and the number of residents involved is manageable, it’s preferable to isolate residents into separate floors or wings of the home. Residents in isolation should not attend communal areas, including shared lavatories and bathrooms. Symptom management measures should be taken to keep the resident as comfortable as possible. This may include medicines which will need to be prescribed and monitored by the resident’s GP.</p>

<p>If symptoms worsen during isolation or are no better after 7 days, contact NHS 111 or the named clinician for the care home to receive further advice around escalation and to ensure appropriate clinical care and person-centred decision making is followed. For a medical emergency dial 999.</p>

<p>Care homes will be supported to recognise residents with symptoms using daily monitoring as above. During the weekly check-in, the clinical lead can support the home to understand the RESTORE2 and NEWS2 scoring system as a way of monitoring residents with symptoms. If a patient’s symptoms worsen, it’s important to contact 111 or the registered GP to receive a clinical assessment either remotely or face to face. Further advice should be given on escalation and how to ensure that decisions are made in the context of a resident’s advance care plan, supporting an escalation to secondary care where appropriate. In a medical emergency the care home should dial 999.</p>

<p>Staff should immediately instigate full infection control measures to care for the resident with symptoms (if not already in place), which will avoid the virus spreading to other residents in the care home and stop staff members or other residents becoming infected.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) in care homes</a>.</p>

<p>Care home staff should note that people with dementia and cognitive impairment may be less able to report symptoms because of communication difficulties, and therefore staff should be alert to the presence of signs as well as symptoms of the virus. This could include delirium, which people with dementia are more prone to suffer from if they develop an infection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-supporting-adults-with-learning-disabilities-and-autistic-adults" class="govuk-link">Further guidance is available for people with a learning disability and/or autistic people</a>. This provides information about the additional things to do if you’re caring for this group of people.</p>

<p>Around two-thirds of people living in care homes for the over 65s are over 85 years old and it’s estimated that around 70% will be living with dementia. <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/care-providers/coronavirus-covid-19/dementia/care-homes?utm_campaign=11544303_SCIELine%2014%20May&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=SOCIAL%20CARE%20INSTITUTE%20FOR%20EXCELLENCE%20&amp;utm_sfid=003G000000w1tbsIAA&amp;utm_role=Regulator%20or%20Inspector&amp;dm_i=4O5,6VFN3,5HYUWV,RL3DJ,1">Advice on dementia</a> has also been provided by the <abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr>.</p>

<p><a href="#annex-c" class="govuk-link">Annex C</a> provides further information on the appropriate isolation required for care home residents who have been discharged from hospital following treatment for COVID-19.</p>

<h3>C. Supporting existing residents who may require hospital care</h3>

<p>If you think a resident may need to be transferred to hospital for urgent and essential treatment, consider the following checklist.</p>

<h4>A resident shows symptoms of COVID-19</h4>

<p>If a resident shows symptoms of COVID-19, assess the appropriateness of hospitalisation.</p>

<p>To do this, the care home may need to contact their local registered GP or the appropriate out-of-hours service for advice. Consult the resident’s advance care plan or treatment escalation plan and discuss with the resident and/or their family member(s) or health and welfare attorney and their GP as appropriate, following usual practice to determine if hospitalisation is the best course of action for the resident.</p>

<h4>If hospitalisation is required</h4>

<p>If hospitalisation is required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control" class="govuk-link">infection prevention and control guidelines</a> for patient transport</li>
  <li>inform the receiving healthcare facility as early as possible that the incoming patient has COVID-19 symptoms</li>
</ul>

<h4>If hospitalisation is not required</h4>

<p>If hospitalisation is not required, follow infection prevention and control and isolation procedures and consult the resident’s GP for advice on clinical management, using remote monitoring as needed (see <a href="#annex-c" class="govuk-link">Annex C</a> and <a href="#annex-d" class="govuk-link">Annex D</a>).</p>

<h4>Support with general health needs</h4>

<p>If a resident requires support with general health needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flag each resident who requires review by the weekly ‘check in’ with the aligned Primary Care Network (PCN) or GP practice (see section on NHS support).</li>
  <li>consult the resident’s GP and community healthcare staff to seek advice</li>
  <li>alternatively, contact NHS 111 for clinical advice</li>
</ul>

<h4>Postpone routine non-essential medical and other appointments</h4>

<p>Review appointments (medical and non-medical) that would involve residents visiting a hospital or other healthcare facilities and discuss with the healthcare provider whether these could be delivered remotely.</p>

<h3>D. Management and isolation of residents exposed to a possible or confirmed COVID-19 case</h3>

<p>Residents who are known to have been exposed to a person with possible or confirmed COVID-19 (an exposure similar to a household setting), should be isolated (or cohorted if not possible) with other similarly exposed residents who do not have COVID-19 symptoms until 14 days after last exposure.</p>

<p>If a resident displays symptoms or signs consistent with COVID-19 in the 14 days after exposure then relevant diagnostic tests, including for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19), should be performed (see testing section above for more information). These residents should be isolated or cohorted with other suspected cases while results are pending if these measures are not already in place. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link">[footnote 6]</a></sup></p>

<p>Please see <a href="#section-5-advice-for-staff" class="govuk-link">section 5</a> for advice for staff exposed to a possible or confirmed COVID-19 case.</p>

<h3>E. Primary care and community health services for residents</h3>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/COVID-19-response-primary-care-and-community-health-support-care-home-residents.pdf" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> wrote to all <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, general practices and community health service providers on 1 May</a>, requesting that primary care and community health services help to support care homes, building on the services already in place in much of England. This should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivery of a consistent, weekly ‘check-in’, to review patients identified as a clinical priority for assessment and care</li>
  <li>supporting the development and delivery of personalised care and support plans for care home residents</li>
  <li>provision of clinical pharmacy and medication support to care homes, including facilitating medication supply and delivering structured medication reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>This support should be provided by a multidisciplinary team, working across general practices and community services providers, and will be delivered remotely where appropriate in order to reduce infection control risks. Care homes should have access to an identified clinical lead for this primary care and community health service support.</p>

<h3>F. Residents without relevant mental capacity</h3>

<p>Some residents of care homes, including those being admitted from hospitals and the community, may lack the relevant mental capacity needed to make decisions about arrangements for their own care and treatment. For example, some people with dementia and learning disabilities may lack the relevant capacity to make these decisions, and will fall under the empowering framework of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (<abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>) and are protected by its safeguards, including the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (<abbr title="Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards">DoLS</abbr>).</p>

<p>Duties and powers under the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> still apply during this period. If care home staff think the person may lack the relevant mental capacity to make the decisions about their ongoing care and treatment, a capacity assessment should be carried out before a decision about their discharge from hospital and admission to a care home is made. During the emergency period, professionals may want to consider a proportionate approach to such assessments to enable timely discharge.</p>

<p>If a resident does not have relevant mental capacity, for example, to make necessary decisions (including care, treatment and residence decisions), staff will need to consider the legal, decision-making framework offered by the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-looking-after-people-who-lack-mental-capacity" class="govuk-link">guidance on the use of the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> and <abbr title="Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards">DoLS</abbr></a> during this emergency period. <abbr title="Social Care Institute for Excellence">SCIE</abbr> provides <a rel="external" href="https://www.scie.org.uk/mca/practice/care-planning/monitoring-implementation" class="govuk-link">guidance on implementing the Mental Capacity Act</a> specifically to support care homes in undertaking this. It covers involving residents in the process, best interests decisions, reviews, <abbr title="Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards">DoLS</abbr> and includes a useful checklist for monitoring <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> implementation.</p>

<p>Care home staff will need to consider the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr> and this guidance, when making decisions for people who lack the relevant mental capacity to make them. This includes residents who cannot make their own decision about testing.</p>

<p>If a person lacks capacity to provide consent to be tested for COVID-19, the decision maker should where necessary make a ‘best interests decision’ under the <abbr title="Mental Capacity Act 2005">MCA</abbr>. When doing so, they must consider all the relevant circumstances and should make a record of their decision. This must be undertaken in relation to the individual and should never be determined in relation to groups of people. Additional time may be required to make the best interests decision in these situations.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span> Reporting of COVID-19 cases and outbreak management</h2>

<p>Please inform the local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> at <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> of a single possible or confirmed case within the care home (See <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-b">Annex B</a> for definitions of cases and contacts). The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will also provide initial testing for symptomatic residents (see information on testing in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-1-admission">section 1</a>). The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will provide advice and support along with local authority partners to help the care home to manage the outbreak.</p>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19, or clinically suspected cases of COVID-19 among people in the same specific setting, with the onset of symptoms within 14 days. For more detailed guidance on the definitions of outbreaks please see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-epidemiological-definitions-of-outbreaks-and-clusters" class="govuk-link">COVID-19: epidemiological definitions of outbreaks and clusters in particular settings</a> guidance.</p>

<p>If an outbreak is declared, testing of staff and residents is needed in order to help contain the outbreak. A <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/967360/care-home-outbreak-testing-guidance-england-visual-v1602.pdf" class="govuk-link">summary of the outbreak testing process is available</a>, along with full guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/988099/Care_Home_Testing_Guidance_England_v12-03_rev4_DIGITAL.pdf" rel="external">care home COVID-19 testing guidance</a>.</p>

<p>If a new case is identified in a care home (not a discharged COVID-19 positive case diagnosed in hospital), a risk assessment should be undertaken to see if all communal activities in the care home should be stopped, and care homes should follow <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> advice. The <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> may advise that restrictions may need to be implemented for 14 days. For example, they may advise closure of the home to further admissions, recognising this is usually the care home manager’s decision in discussion with their commissioners (and alerting the <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr> and local authority).</p>

<p>In the event of an outbreak in a care home, the home should immediately stop visiting (except in exceptional circumstances such as end of life) to protect vulnerable residents, staff and visitors. Essential care givers can continue to visit unless there are specific reasons not to do so.  Please refer to guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">visiting arrangements in care homes</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/arrangements-for-visiting-out-of-the-care-home/visits-out-of-care-homes" class="govuk-link">visits out of care homes</a> for further details.</p>

<p>If 14 days have passed since the last positive test or symptomatic case, a round of PCR and lateral flow device end of outbreak testing of all residents and staff should be undertaken. In addition, from May 2021, PCR test positive results will be sent for whole genome sequence to detect variants of concern (VOCs) in care home outbreak situations.</p>

<p>Visiting restrictions associated with an outbreak in the care home can be lifted by the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>day 14 recovery testing detects no new cases, and</li>
  <li>no variant of concern (other than <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-20DEC-01 [Kent]) was identified through whole genome sequencing or reflex PCR tests results</li>
</ul>

<p>If test results confirm a variant of concern in the outbreak (other than <abbr title="variant of concern">VOC</abbr>-20DEC-01 [Kent]) then the outbreak restrictions should remain in place until whole home recovery testing has been completed after a period of 28 days with no new cases.</p>

<p>To support local areas in controlling the infection, the 14-day period to recovery from outbreaks is tracked in the Capacity Tracker.</p>

<p>We will continue to update the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/visiting-care-homes-during-coronavirus/update-on-policies-for-visiting-arrangements-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">care home visiting guidance</a> on safe care home visits as appropriate. Visitors should be supported to wear Personal Protective Equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) in line with this guidance.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span> Care for people at the end of life and after death</h2>

<p>Care at the end of life for residents, regardless of the cause of their deterioration, should be provided for in line with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liverpool-care-pathway-review-response-to-recommendations">5 priorities for care</a>.</p>

<p>Each resident should have a plan of care tailored to their individual needs and preferences that includes explicit consideration of food and fluids, symptom management and psychological, social and spiritual support. They should be asked, where possible, if they would like to receive a visit from a loved one or a faith leader. Their family and those important to them should be informed about what is happening and offered the opportunity to visit.</p>

<p>After death, the infection control precautions described in this document continue to apply while a person who has died remains in the care home. This is due to the ongoing risk of infectious transmission via contact, although the risk is usually lower than from those living.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-care-of-the-deceased" class="govuk-link">Guidance for care of the deceased with suspected or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span> Advice for staff</h2>

<p>Responsibility for the safety of staff remains with their employer.</p>

<p>During a period of sustained transmission of COVID-19 across the UK, an additional level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required for normal care. See <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">guidance on specific <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for use in the care home sector</a>.</p>

<p>Given the evidence of the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> strongly recommends that care homes do all they can to restrict staff movement wherever feasible. The check list in <a href="#annex-e" class="govuk-link">Annex E</a> sets out the actions that providers from care homes should take – as far as it’s feasible for them to do so without compromising other aspects of safe care – if they have not already done so.</p>

<p>If staff have symptoms of COVID-19 – a high temperature, new and persistent cough or anosmia, however mild – they should self-isolate for at least 10 days from when their symptoms started OR if they are not experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for COVID-19 the staff member should self-isolate for at least 10 days starting from the day the test was taken<sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:10" class="govuk-link">[footnote 10]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If staff have tested positive while not experiencing symptoms but develop symptoms during the isolation period, they should restart the 10-day isolation period from the day they develop symptoms<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">[footnote 10]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>When there are visits from health care and social care workers, these staff should be advised to wear <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a>.</p>

<p>If a health or social care worker has come into close contact with a resident with confirmed COVID-19, or a symptomatic resident suspected of having COVID-19, while not wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, or had a breach in their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> while providing personal care to a resident with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, then the staff member should inform their line manager. Please refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">How to work safely in care homes</a> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> resource.</p>

<p>In assessing whether a health or social care worker has had a breach of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, a risk assessment should be undertaken in conjunction with local <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> policy.</p>

<p>The following factors should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the severity of symptoms the resident has</li>
  <li>the length of exposure, the proximity of the resident</li>
  <li>the activities that took place when the worker was in proximity (for example, Aerosol Generating Procedures (<abbr title="Aerosol Generating Procedures">AGPs</abbr>) monitoring, personal care)</li>
  <li>whether the health or social care worker had their eyes, nose or mouth exposed</li>
</ul>

<p>If the risk assessment concludes there has been a significant breach, or close contact without <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, the worker should isolate for 10 days, in line with national guidance<sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">[footnote 11]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Examples that are unlikely to be considered breaches include if a health or social care worker was not wearing gloves for a short period of time or their gloves tore, and they washed their hands immediately, or if their apron tore while caring for a resident, and this was replaced promptly.</p>

<p>This would also apply to other individuals present in a care environment, for example an allied health professional, visitor or family member, if they’re following instructions from that institution.</p>

<p>For more information on interpreting test results and the actions required for both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, see the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings">flowcharts illustrating the return to work process</a>.</p>

<h3>Test and Trace system: information for staff</h3>

<p>Under the new COVID-19 Test and Trace system, anyone who has had a specific ‘close contact’ with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 will be expected to isolate themselves for 10 days. Broadly, a ‘close contact’ is spending 15 minutes or more within 2 metres of an infected person, very close specified personal interaction for a shorter period of time or someone who has lived within the same household during a period of potential risk transmission. More detailed definitions of close contact for staff and residents are provided at <a href="#annex-b" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a>.</p>

<p>There are special arrangements for people who work in the NHS, care homes or primary schools, and who have regular LFD tests as part of an asymptomatic testing workplace programme.</p>

<p>In this situation, if the care home staff’s LFD test result is positive, they and their household should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">self-isolate and follow these steps</a>. They should also take a confirmatory PCR test that will be provided by the care home.</p>

<p>If this PCR test result is positive, they and their household must complete the full self-isolation period. If this PCR test result is negative, and they have no symptoms of COVID-19, they and their household can stop isolating.</p>

<p>If someone who tests positive for COVID-19 works in, or has recently visited, a care home, the case will be referred to local public health teams who will liaise with the care home.</p>

<p>If anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 identifies a member of staff as a close recent contact (that is as the result of a contact outside the workplace), and if the NHS Test and Trace service notifies that member of staff, they must self-isolate for 10 days in line with the standard guidance.</p>

<p>For care home staff, it’s helpful to distinguish between 3 potential scenarios where ‘close contact’ occurs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a staff member who has been caring for a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or who has symptoms of COVID-19 while the staff member was wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. Staff will not need to isolate in these cases, but these contacts will be escalated to the local public health team for further advice if needed</li>
  <li>a staff member who has been caring for a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 or who has symptoms of COVID-19 while the staff member was wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> but the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> has been breached. The member of staff will need to isolate for 10 days in line with the advice to the general population (see advice above for examples of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> breaches)</li>
  <li>a staff member who has been in contact with anyone else who has tested positive for COVID-19 whether at work (most likely a colleague in communal areas) or in the community. The member of staff will need to isolate for 10 days in line with the advice to the general population</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff with suspected symptoms</h3>

<p>Staff who have COVID-19 symptoms should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>not attend work</li>
  <li>notify their line manager immediately</li>
  <li>self-isolate for 10 days, following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection">guidance for household isolation</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings" class="govuk-link">guidance on management of exposed healthcare workers</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If care home staff or a member of their household have symptoms and are self-isolating, they should be tested (using the testing routes described above).</p>

<p>Staff who have a symptomatic household member should stay at home and not leave the house for 10 days. The 10-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill. If the staff member develops symptoms during this period, they must restart their isolation period for a further 10 days, in line with national guidance. They can return to work after completing their isolation period but should have been well without fever for at least 48 hours in addition. See further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection" class="govuk-link">guidance for household isolation</a>.</p>

<p>If all symptomatic household members test negative, the member of staff can return to work if they feel well enough to do so. If any members of the household test positive, they should continue to isolate and follow government guidelines.</p>

<p>Staff who test negative for COVID-19 can return to work if they’re medically fit to do so, as long as they have not been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case. Staff should have a discussion with their line manager and appropriate local risk assessment before returning to work. Staff should consult their GP and occupational health if symptoms persist.</p>

<p>Interpret negative results with caution together with clinical assessment. If needed, local support for staff return to work risk assessments during an outbreak can be accessed from your local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> or from your <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> lead via your local <abbr title="clinical commissioning group">CCG</abbr>.</p>

<p>Symptomatic staff who test positive for COVID-19 and symptomatic staff who have not had a test can return to work only if they meet the criteria below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no earlier than 10 days from symptom onset, in line with national guidance, provided clinical improvement has occurred and they have been afebrile (not feverish) without medication for 48 hours and they are medically fit to return</li>
  <li>if a cough or a loss of or a change in normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia) is the only persistent symptom after 10 days (and they have been afebrile for 48 hours without medication), they can return to work (post-viral cough known to persist for several weeks in some cases) if they are medically fit to return.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If staff are asymptomatic when tested</h3>

<p>Staff may be tested when they’re asymptomatic as part of the whole care home testing approach.</p>

<p>Staff who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test can remain at work or return to work immediately as long as they remain asymptomatic and as long as they have not been identified as a close contact of a confirmed case (see above).</p>

<p>Staff who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19) and who were asymptomatic at the time of the test must self-isolate for 10 days from the date of the test, in line with national guidance</p>

<p>If applicable, all members of a household shared with the individual who has tested positive should self-isolate for 10 days from the day the individual’s test was taken. However, if any household member of a care worker develops symptoms of COVID-19, they should isolate for 10 days from the onset of their symptoms, in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance" class="govuk-link">stay at home guidance</a>.</p>

<p>A care worker can return to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no earlier than 10 days from symptom onset, in line with national guidance, provided clinical improvement has occurred and they have been afebrile (not feverish) without medication for 48 hours and they are medically fit to return</li>
  <li>if a cough or a loss of or a change in normal sense of smell or taste (anosmia) is the only persistent symptom after 10 days (and they have been afebrile for 48 hours without medication), they can return to work (post-viral cough known to persist for several weeks in some cases) if they are medically fit to return</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff may require evidence of viral clearance prior to working with extremely vulnerable people. This is subject to local policy.</p>

<p>Currently it is not known how long any immunity to COVID-19 might last. If staff become unwell again, they should self-isolate and may need to be tested again.</p>

<p>Further advice on return to work of staff with complex health needs, including immunosuppression, can be received from designated infection control leads in <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr>, from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team" class="govuk-link">local health protection teams in <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr></a> and/or from directors of public health, according to local arrangements.</p>

<h3>Advice for care home managers</h3>

<p>Care home capacity should be monitored via the Capacity Tracker and this data will be shared with local resilience forums (<abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>) via the daily national situation reports to support capacity planning and response. Local authorities will also use this information to inform their care home support plans. Where providers consider there to be imminent risks to the continuity of care, such as the potential closure of a service, they should raise this with the local authority without delay.</p>

<p>Care home managers should review sick leave policies and occupational health support for care home staff and support unwell staff to stay at home as per guidance for household isolation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/guidance-for-employers-and-businesses-on-coronavirus-covid-19" class="govuk-link">Support for employers on working safely during coronavirus (COVID-19)</a></p>

<p>Staff may be ill due to other reasons and may need to adhere to specific return-to-work procedures – for example, staff may be off due to diarrhoea and vomiting and should wait 48 hours before returning to work.</p>

<p>Ensure staff are provided with appropriate training and support to continue providing care to all residents. Employers can access rapid <a href="https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/COVID-19-Essential-training.aspx" class="govuk-link" rel="external">online induction training</a> for new staff. This includes key elements of the Care Certificate and is available free of charge.</p>

<p>All care homes should have a business continuity policy in place including a plan for surge capacity for staffing, including using mutual aid.</p>

<p>The government’s £600 million Adult Social Care Infection Prevention Fund is helping providers pay for additional staff and/or maintain the normal wages of staff who are self-isolating, or have reduced the number of hours they work to stop the spread of infection.</p>

<p>Social care staff in England can refer anyone who needs to self-isolate to NHS Volunteer Responders. You can make direct referrals through the <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodsamapp.org%2FNHSreferral&amp;data=02%7C01%7CSarah.Cowley-Beadman%40cqc.org.uk%7C3e0b2567202348d5318208d7fccc0da3%7Ca55dcab8ce6645eaab3f65bc2b07b5d3%7C1%7C0%7C637255826258570881&amp;sdata=lgoctRSzmO%2F4og8EL640d4oe5ZfBlRGzSVgmisB6c3Q%3D&amp;reserved=0">NHS Volunteer Responders referrers’ portal</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span> National support available to implement this guidance</h2>

<p>On 15 May 2020, the government published a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-care-home-support-package">care home support package</a>, backed by an additional £600 million to support care home providers through a new Adult Social Care Infection Control Fund.</p>

<p>Providers should look at this support package to view details of the support for care homes which provides additional resources for care homes, using the latest domestic and international evidence brought together by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>, and drawing on the insights of care providers.</p>

<h2>Annex A: COVID-19 symptoms and higher risk groups</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 (coronavirus) are <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link">[footnote 7]</a></sup> recent onset of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a new continuous cough and/or</li>
  <li>high temperature</li>
  <li>a loss of, or change to, the individual’s sense of smell or taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Care home residents (both older residents and younger ones living with a learning disability or autism) may not present with the typical symptoms of cough or fever and may not be able to report loss of taste or smell.</p>

<p>It’s important to assess residents twice daily for the development of a high temperature (37.8°C or above), a cough, as well as for softer signs such as being short of breath, being not as alert, having a new onset of confusion, being off food, having reduced fluid intake, diarrhoea or vomiting.</p>

<p>Through NHS ‘mutual aid’ the NHS will be supporting care home professionals to use well evaluated tools such as RESTORE2 and NEWS2 (supported in current <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/resources/covid-19-managing-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-care-homes"><abbr title="British Geriatric Society">BGS</abbr> guidance</a>). This will be accompanied by support and access to specific equipment such as pulse oximeters, which can also help to determine whether a resident is unwell. Equipment which is used to support the monitoring of residents will need to meet infection control and decontamination standards and guidance.</p>

<h3>Persons at higher risk of COVID-19 in a care home setting</h3>

<p>The following individuals may be at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus (COVID-19). Care home providers should be stringent in following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing" class="govuk-link">social distancing measures</a> for everyone in the care home and in supporting those in clinically extremely vulnerable groups to follow shielding guidance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone who has received a letter notifying them they fall within the category of clinically extremely vulnerable should consider following the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">shielding guidance</a> to protect themselves</li>
  <li>anyone aged 70 years or older (regardless of medical conditions) is advised to follow social distancing guidance for the clinically vulnerable</li>
  <li>anyone aged under 70 years with an underlying health condition – for most this will align with eligibility for the flu jab on medical grounds – is advised to follow social distancing guidance for the clinically vulnerable</li>
</ul>

<p>Residents should also be up to date with their routine vaccinations such as annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination.</p>

<h2>Annex B: definitions of COVID-19 cases and contacts</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>A ‘contact’ is a person who has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. You can be a contact anytime from 2 days before the person who tested positive developed their symptoms, and up to 10 days after, as this is when they can pass the infection on to others. A risk assessment may be undertaken to determine this, but a contact can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>anyone who lives in the same household as another person who has COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19</li>
  <li>anyone who has had any of the following types of contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19:
    <ul>
      <li>face-to-face contact including being coughed on or having a face-to-face conversation within one metre</li>
      <li>been within one metre for one minute or longer without face-to-face contact</li>
      <li>sexual contacts</li>
      <li>been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes (either as a one-off contact, or added up together over one day)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>travelled in the same vehicle or a plane</li>
</ul>

<p>An interaction through a Perspex (or equivalent) screen with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 is not usually considered to be a contact, as long as there has been no other contact such as those in the list above.</p>

<p>If you are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 you will be notified by NHS Test and Trace via text message, email or phone and should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person/guidance-for-contacts-of-people-with-possible-or-confirmed-coronavirus-covid-19-infection-who-do-not-live-with-the-person" class="govuk-link">follow the guidance for contacts closely</a>.</p>

<p>Please also see <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-5-advice-for-staff">section 5</a> for further advice for staff.</p>

<p>There’s further guidance for staff in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings/covid-19-management-of-exposed-healthcare-workers-and-patients-in-hospital-settings#staff-return-to-work-criteria">management of staff and exposed patients or residents in health and social care settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Possible case of COVID-19 in the care home</h3>

<p>Possible case of COVID-19 in the care home: any resident (or staff member) with symptoms of COVID-19 (high temperature, new continuous cough, or loss of or change to the individual’s sense of smell or taste), or new onset of influenza-like illness or worsening shortness of breath.</p>

<h3>Confirmed case of COVID-19</h3>
<p>Confirmed case of COVID-19: any resident (or staff member) with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>

<h3>Resident contacts</h3>

<p>Resident contacts: any resident that meets one of the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lives in the same unit or floor as a confirmed case (for example, shares the same communal areas)</li>
  <li>has had face-to-face contact (within one metre) of a confirmed case, including being coughed on, having a face-to-face conversation, or having skin-to-skin physical contact</li>
  <li>has had any contact within one metre for one minute or longer with a confirmed case, without face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>has spent more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of a confirmed case</li>
</ul>

<h3>Staff contacts</h3>

<p>Staff contacts: any staff member that has had the following contact while not wearing appropriate <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> or who has had a breach in their <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>has had face-to-face contact (within one metre) of a confirmed case, including being coughed on, having a face-to-face conversation, or having skin-to-skin physical contact</li>
  <li>has had any contact within one metre for one minute or longer with a confirmed case, without face-to-face contact</li>
  <li>has spent more than 15 minutes within 2 metres of a confirmed case</li>
  <li>has cleaned a personal or communal area of the home where a confirmed case has been located (note this only applies to the first time cleaning the personal or communal area)</li>
  <li>has been notified that they’re a contact of a co-worker who has been confirmed as a COVID-19 case</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outbreak</h3>

<p>An outbreak is defined as 2 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 or clinically suspected cases of COVID-19 among individuals associated with a specific setting with onset dates within 14 days. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link">[footnote 8]</a></sup></p>

<p>If there’s a single laboratory confirmed case, this would initiate further investigation and risk assessment.</p>

<p>Care homes should seek advice from their local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> if they have a single possible case of COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Annex C: isolation of residents during periods of sustained transmission</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>Due to evidence of asymptomatic spread, during periods of sustained transmission we recommend that all residents being discharged from hospital or interim care facilities to the care home and new residents admitted from the community should be isolated for 14 days within their own room.</p>

<h3>Isolation of COVID-19 positive residents</h3>

<h4>A. Single case</h4>
<p>Single case – isolation of a symptomatic resident. All symptomatic residents should be immediately isolated for 14 days from onset of symptoms or positive test result when available and until their fever has resolved for 48 hours consecutively without medication to reduce their fever. <sup role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote" class="govuk-link">[footnote 9]</a></sup></p>

<h4>B. More than one case</h4>

<p>More than one case – cohorting of all symptomatic residents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>symptomatic residents should ideally be isolated in single occupancy rooms</li>
  <li>where this is not practical, cohort symptomatic residents together in multi-occupancy rooms. Residents with suspected COVID-19 should be cohorted only with other residents with suspected COVID-19. Residents with suspected COVID-19 should not be cohorted with residents with confirmed COVID-19</li>
  <li>do not cohort suspected or confirmed patients next to immunocompromised residents</li>
  <li>when transferring symptomatic residents between rooms, the resident should wear a surgical face mask</li>
  <li>clearly sign the rooms by placing infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) signs, indicating droplet and contact precautions, at the entrance of the room</li>
</ul>

<h3>Isolation and cohorting of contacts</h3>

<p>Careful risk assessment of the duration and nature of contact should be carried out, to put in place measures such as isolation and cohorting of exposed and unexposed residents. Please refer to the definition of contacts in <a href="#annex-b" class="govuk-link">Annex B</a>.</p>

<p>There are broadly 3 types of isolation measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>isolation of contacts individually in single rooms for 14 days after last exposure to a possible or confirmed case: this should be the preferred option where possible. These contacts should be carefully monitored for any symptoms of COVID-19 during the 14-day period as described earlier</li>
  <li>cohorting of contacts within one unit rather than individually: consider this option if isolation in single rooms is not possible due to shortage of single rooms when large numbers of exposed contacts are involved</li>
  <li>protective cohorting of unexposed residents: residents who have not had any exposure to the symptomatic case can be cohorted separately in another unit within the home away from the cases and exposed contacts</li>
  <li>clinically extremely vulnerable residents should be in a single room and not share bathrooms with other residents or staff</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex D: infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>Care homes are not expected to have dedicated isolation facilities for people living in the home but should implement isolation precautions when someone in the home displays symptoms of COVID-19 in the same way that they would operate if an individual had influenza or diarrhoea and vomiting, taking the following precautions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if isolation is needed, a resident’s own room can be used. Ideally the room should be a single bedroom with en-suite facilities. Where this is not available, a dedicated bathroom near to the person’s bedroom should be identified for their use only</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> should be used when within 2 metres of a resident with possible or confirmed COVID-19. See <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">guidance on <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on working safely in care homes</a>. Display signage to prevent unnecessary entry into the isolation room. Confidentiality must be maintained</li>
  <li>room door(s) should be kept closed where possible and safe to do so. Where this is not possible, ensure the bed is moved to the furthest safe point in the room to try and achieve a 2-metre distance to the open door as part of a risk assessment</li>
  <li>all necessary procedures and care should be carried out within the resident’s room. Only essential staff rostered to the individual resident (wearing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>) should enter the resident’s room (see <a href="#annex-e" class="govuk-link">Annex E</a> and <a href="#annex-f" class="govuk-link">Annex F</a>)</li>
  <li>entry and exit from the room should be minimised during care, specifically when these care procedures produce aerosols or respiratory droplets (this is further explained in <a href="#annex-f" class="govuk-link">Annex F</a>)</li>
  <li>ensure adequate appropriate supplies of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, cleaning materials, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene materials, and waste disposal are available for all staff in the care home</li>
  <li>all staff, including domestic cleaners, must be trained to understand how to use the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> appropriate to their role to limit the spread of COVID-19</li>
  <li>to support this, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has worked with the care sector representative bodies to produce specialised training videos for using standard <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, offering tailored insights into <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes">how the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance applies in care settings</a>
</li>
  <li>dedicate specific medical equipment (for example, thermometers, blood pressure cuffs, pulse oximeters, etc) for residents. Clean and disinfect equipment (including mobility aids) before re-use with another resident in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions, and where relevant return to the company for cleaning, for example pressure-relieving mattresses. Particular attention should be paid to cleaning of any reusable equipment taken between the residents’ bedrooms</li>
  <li>Where possible during outbreaks of COVID-19, use single-resident use devices such as blood pressure cuffs. Single-resident use equipment will be marked with a symbol depicting the number 2 in a circle with a line through it</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Symbol depicting the number 2 in a circle with a line through it. This indicates that an item with this symbol should only be used once." src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/100337/single-use-symbol.jpg"></div></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure only equipment needed for the resident’s care is kept in their bedroom to make cleaning easier</li>
  <li>Restrict sharing of personal devices (mobility devices, books, electronic gadgets) with other residents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex E: restricting workforce movement and minimising workforce transmission</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic we know that most care home providers have been taking steps that minimise the movement of workforce in order to reduce the risk of asymptomatic transmission of the virus between members of staff and between staff and residents. These steps have been taken on top of, not instead of, appropriate use of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Given the evidence of the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> strongly recommends that care homes do all they can to restrict staff movement wherever feasible. The checklist below sets out the actions that providers from care homes should consider taking if they have not already done so. Not all of these actions will be possible or appropriate for every provider but, when taken in combination, will help reduce the risk of outbreaks in homes and slow the spread of the virus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that members of staff work in only one care home wherever possible. This includes staff who work for one employer across several homes, or members of staff that work on a part-time basis for multiple employers.</li>
  <li>Extend these restrictions to agency staff, under the general principle that the fewer settings members of staff work in, the better.</li>
  <li>Providers should consider limiting or ‘cohorting’ staff to individual groups of patients or floors/wings. This needs careful management and explicit agreement with staff, adherence to the latest guidance and relevant <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>.</li>
  <li>Where additional staff are needed to restrict movement between or within care homes, look to actively increase recruitment of staff. Advertise vacancies on <a rel="external" href="https://findajob.dwp.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">Find a Job</a>, and use materials from the <a rel="external" href="https://www.everydayisdifferent.com/resources.aspx" class="govuk-link">national recruitment campaign</a> in order to support recruitment activities.</li>
  <li>Take steps to limit use of public transport by members of staff. Where they do not have their own private vehicle, this could include encouraging walking or cycling to and from work and supporting this with changing facilities or rooms, ideally used separately rather than at the same time on shift change. In some instances, local taxi firms may be willing to provide fares to and from a care home at discounted rates.</li>
  <li>Consider how you could provide accommodation for staff who proactively choose to stay separately from their families in order to limit social interaction outside work. This may be provision on site, or in partnership with local hotels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Annex F: provision and use of personal protective equipment (<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>)</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>On 28 September 2020, the government set out its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-strategy-stabilise-and-build-resilience"><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> strategy</a>, including for the social care sector.</p>

<p>The government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="govuk-link">infection prevention and control guidance</a> includes guidance for usage in the social care sector. When there’s sustained transmission of COVID-19 across the UK, an additional level of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">guidance on specific <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for use in the care home sector</a>.</p>

<p>Providers should ensure <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> meets the required specifications recommended in <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> guidance.</p>

<p>The rationale underlying all <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> distribution and utilisation should be based on clinical risk. Managers of care homes and all staff should be familiar with and should use the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> recommended by <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> to keep staff and patients safe and to assure essential flows of equipment.</p>

<p>To support the social care sector in using <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> have published tailored resources on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes" class="govuk-link">how to work safely in care homes</a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-domiciliary-care">how to work safely in domiciliary care</a>. These include summarised tables, a Q&amp;A and a specialised <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-how-to-work-safely-in-care-homes/covid-19-putting-on-and-removing-ppe-a-guide-for-care-homes-video">training video on putting on and removing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr></a> in social care settings.</p>

<p><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr> has also published <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-illustrated-guide-for-community-and-social-care-settings">an illustrated <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guide for community and social care settings</a>. This translates the existing <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance into a simple, visual format that applies to all settings.</p>

<p>These are the main sources of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> guidance for the social care sector.</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>

<p><abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is a key part of infection prevention and control. Ensuring a supply of <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to the adult social care sector is fundamental to protect care workers and allow them to continue to safely provide personal care for vulnerable individuals during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Following the initial announcement in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-coronavirus-covid-19-winter-plan-2020-to-2021" class="govuk-link">adult social care winter plan</a> of free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision to health and social workers until March 2021, the scheme has been extended until the end of June 2021 to better support this critical stage for vaccination and mass testing programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered residential care homes and domiciliary care providers may register for the <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal and providers will have received an invitation to the email address they have used to register with the <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-emergency-personal-protective-equipment" class="govuk-link">guidance page for the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal</a> has the current order limits for social care providers, which varies depending upon the size of the provider. We will keep order limits under review to make sure these are based on the latest public health guidance, COVID-19 trends, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> requirements modelling and analysis, and provider feedback.</p>

<p>Providers should not use the portal to order <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> for non-COVID-19 requirements and should obtain this through normal channels.</p>

<p>Adult social care providers who are not <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>-registered and therefore not covered by the <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> portal should contact their local resilience forum (<abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr>) where it is continuing to distribute <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, or local authority if the <abbr title="local resilience forum">LRF</abbr> has stood down regular distribution, to obtain their free <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> provision for COVID-19 needs. These providers should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers" class="govuk-link">contact their local authority</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Where there is an emergency need, all adult social care providers can access the emergency <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> stockpile held by <abbr title="local resilience forums">LRFs</abbr>. Where this need is urgent and <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> is required within 72 hours, providers can access <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> through the National Supply Disruption Response (<abbr title="National Supply Disruption Response">NSDR</abbr>). The <abbr title="National Supply Disruption Response">NSDR</abbr> can mobilise small priority orders of critical <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> to fulfil an emergency need. The helpline is available 24/7 at 0800 915 9964.</p>

<h3>Hand hygiene</h3>

<p>Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential before and after all contact with the person being cared for, removal of protective clothing and cleaning of equipment and the environment.</p>

<p>Ensure that liquid soap and disposable paper towels are available at all sinks.</p>

<p>Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) can be used if hands are not visibly dirty or soiled and should have adequate provision and be accessible.</p>

<p>Promote hand hygiene ensuring that everyone, including residents, staff, service users and visitors, have access to hand washing facilities.</p>

<p>Provide alcohol-based hand rub in prominent places, where possible.</p>

<p>Any visitors should be instructed in respiratory and hand hygiene, and should wash their hands on arrival into the home, often during their stay, and upon leaving.</p>

<p>Homes should regularly audit hand hygiene practice and provide feedback to employees.</p>

<h3>Respiratory and cough hygiene – ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’</h3>

<p>Disposable single-use tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when sneezing, coughing or wiping and blowing the nose. Used tissue should be disposed of promptly in the nearest foot-operated waste bin. Hands should be cleaned with soap and water if possible, after coughing or sneezing, using tissues or after contact with respiratory secretions and/or contaminated objects.</p>

<p>Encourage individuals to keep hands away from eyes, mouth and nose. Some people may need assistance with containment of respiratory secretions. Those who are immobile will need a container at hand for immediate disposal of the tissue such as a bag.</p>

<p>Visible reminders, such as posters, should be placed around the facility, targeting employees, residents, and visitors both for hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.</p>

<h2>Annex G: decontamination and cleaning processes for care homes with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>Domestic staff should be advised to clean the isolation room(s) after all other unaffected areas of the facility have been cleaned. Ideally, isolation room cleaning should be undertaken by staff who are also providing care in the isolation room.</p>

<p>The person responsible for undertaking the cleaning with detergent and disinfectant should be familiar with these processes and procedures:</p>

<h3>A. Preparation</h3>
<p>In preparation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect any cleaning equipment and waste bags required before entering the room</li>
  <li>any single-use cloths and mop heads must be disposed of and reusable ones must be laundered</li>
  <li>before entering the room, perform hand hygiene, then put on a fluid resistant surgical mask (FRSM), disposable plastic apron and gloves</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. Entering the room</h3>

<p>On entering the room:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep the door closed with windows open to improve airflow and ventilation while using detergent and disinfection products</li>
  <li>bag any disposable items that have been used for the care of the patient as per <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-j">Annex J: interim COVID-19 waste management measures</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>C. Cleaning process</h3>

<p>Use disposable cloths/paper roll/disposable mop heads to clean and disinfect all hard surfaces/floor/chairs/door handles/reusable non-invasive care equipment/sanitary fittings in the room, following one of the 2 options below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use either a combined detergent disinfectant solution at a dilution of 1,000 parts per million (ppm) available chlorine (av.cl.)</li>
  <li>a neutral purpose detergent followed by disinfection (1,000 ppm av.cl.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If an alternative disinfectant is used within the organisation, the care home should seek advice from a local infection prevention and control specialist to ensure that this is effective against enveloped viruses.</p>

<p>Follow manufacturer’s instructions for dilution, application and contact times for all detergents and disinfectants.</p>

<p>Any single-use cloths and mop heads must be disposed of and reusable ones must be laundered.</p>

<h4>Cleaning and disinfection of reusable equipment</h4>

<p>Clean and disinfect any reusable non-invasive care equipment, such as blood pressure monitors, digital thermometers, glucometers, that are in the room prior to their removal.</p>

<p>Clean all reusable equipment systematically from the top or furthest away point.</p>

<h4>Carpeted flooring and soft furnishings</h4>

<p>For carpeted floors/items, consult the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning.</p>

<h3>D. Leaving the room</h3>

<p>On leaving the room:</p>

<ul>
  <li>discard detergent/disinfectant solutions safely at disposal point</li>
  <li>dispose of all waste as per <a href="#annex-j" class="govuk-link">Annex J: interim COVID-19 waste management measures</a>
</li>
  <li>clean, dry and store re-usable parts of cleaning equipment, such as mop handles</li>
  <li>remove and discard <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> as per local policy</li>
  <li>perform hand hygiene</li>
</ul>

<h3>E. Staff uniforms</h3>

<p>Uniforms should be transported home in a disposable plastic bag.</p>

<p>Uniforms should be laundered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wash heavily soiled uniforms separately</li>
  <li>in a load not more than half the machine capacity</li>
  <li>at the maximum temperature the fabric can tolerate, then ironed or tumble dried</li>
</ul>

<h3>F. Safe management of linen</h3>

<p>Please refer to <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/527545/Social_care.pdf" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Health Technical Memorandum 01-04: Decontamination of linen for health and social care</a>.</p>

<p>Any towels or other laundry used by the individual should be treated as infectious and placed in an alginate bag then a secondary clear bag. This should then be removed from the isolation room and placed directly into the laundry hamper/bag. Take the laundry hamper as close to the point of use as possible, but do not take it inside the isolation room.</p>

<p>When handling linen do not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rinse, shake or sort linen on removal from beds</li>
  <li>place used/infectious linen on the floor or any other surface, for example a table top</li>
  <li>re-handle used/infectious linen when bagged</li>
  <li>overfill laundry receptacles</li>
  <li>place inappropriate items in the laundry receptacle</li>
</ul>

<p>Laundry must be tagged with the care area and date, and stored in a designated, safe lockable area while awaiting uplift or laundering.</p>

<p>This should be laundered in line with local policy for infectious linen.</p>

<h3>G. Waste</h3>

<p>Care homes that provide nursing or medical care are considered to produce healthcare waste and should comply with <a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/167976/HTM_07-01_Final.pdf" class="govuk-link">Health Technical Memorandum 07-01: Safe management of healthcare waste.</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="#annex-j" class="govuk-link">Annex J</a> for COVID-19 specific guidance on waste disposal.</p>

<p>All consumable waste items that have been in contact with the individual, including used tissues, should be put in a plastic rubbish bag, double bagged and tied. This should be put in a secure location awaiting uplift in line with local policies for contaminated waste.</p>

<p>Waste such as urine or faeces from individuals with possible or confirmed COVID-19 does not require special treatment and can be discharged into the sewage system. If able, the individual can use their en-suite WC.</p>

<p>Communal waste facilities should not be used. Care homes should have well-established processes for waste management.</p>

<h2>Annex H: communications</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>Display signs to inform of the outbreak and infection control measures. Examples can be found in <a rel="external" href="https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/resources/campaigns/101-coronavirus-/resources" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>’s COVID-19 resource centre</a>.</p>

<p>Provide ‘warn and inform’ letters to residents, visitors and staff if there’s a possible case of COVID-19 in the home.</p>

<p>Although the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> will provide public health advice in response to an outbreak (including potential closure to new admissions), the care home management has the final responsibility to communicate information, including to staff and visitors and to implement infection control recommendations and any advice on closure to admissions from the <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr>. The care home has the primary responsibility for the safety of its staff and residents.</p>

<h2>Annex I: use of the Capacity Tracker</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by NHS England and NHS Improvement</strong></p>

<p>The Capacity Tracker provides an England-wide single portal for publishing vacancies in care homes and additional information to support care homes managers linked with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Accurate and timely data is essential for effective management of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic both locally and nationally. A key priority is to ensure daily update of data and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has made access to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-support-for-care-homes">Adult Social Care Infection Control Fund</a> conditional on provision of regular information.
Any information gathered will not be used to drive any regulatory enforcement activity. Our intention is for this information to be used to support collective planning across the health and social care sector and swiftly resolve issues wherever possible, whether through local or national actions.</p>

<h3>About the Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>The Capacity Tracker is managed by the NHS North of England Commissioning Support unit (<abbr title="NHS North of England Commissioning Support unit">NECS</abbr>). It’s an established and robust system that has been successfully supporting the tracking of care home vacancies across a large proportion of England for some time.</p>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a need to quickly extend its use to collect other information such as: <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr> status, workforce status and numbers of residents with COVID-19. This provides local knowledge to support care homes and national visibility of the needs of care homes during the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Information that should be inputted</h3>

<p>To support current discharge planning and understanding of the needs of care homes, providers are asked to input data on current bed capacity and vacancies, and also data on business continuity issues such as workforce, <abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>, number of residents with COVID-19 and overall status of the care home.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKCQC/bulletins/286ff51">joint letter from the Care Provider Alliance, <abbr title="Care Quality Commission">CQC</abbr>, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and NHS England and Improvement which was sent to providers on 17 April</a> outlining the approach to data collection during the COVID-19 period.</p>

<h3>How the NHS and social care system are using this information</h3>

<p>This essential information is being used to support capacity planning and response for care homes by local organisations such as local resilience forums, local authorities and <abbr title="clinical commissioning groups">CCGs</abbr> to understand capacity and pressures across the care home sector.</p>

<h3>How often providers need to update the Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>To support reliable real-time information, it must be updated at least once per day, even if there has been no change in the vacancies within the care home.</p>

<h3>What care home providers need to do</h3>

<p>Please register via the <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://carehomes.necsu.nhs.uk/">Capacity Tracker website</a>. <abbr title="NHS North of England Commissioning Support unit">NECS</abbr> will provide support to help you with this, through a contact centre, online guides and short videos to help you understand what you need to do.</p>

<p>The Resource Centre in the Capacity Tracker also contains up-to-date guidance and information to support you. You will also receive emails containing essential guidance and resources to help you safely care for your residents/patients. Information received will improve the understanding of the support you and colleagues in the care sector may need.</p>

<p>Further advice can be provided by the <a href="https://www.digitalsocialcare.co.uk/digital-social-care-launch-phone-helpline/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">Digital Social Care Helpline</a>.</p>

<h3>The role of local authorities in supporting the Capacity Tracker</h3>

<p>Local authorities, and in particular their brokerage teams, have a key role to play. They should request the required level of access from <abbr title="NHS North of England Commissioning Support unit">NECS</abbr> directly via <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net">necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities should also identify System Champions and send their name and email address to NHS <abbr title="NHS North of England Commissioning Support unit">NECS</abbr> via <a href="mailto:necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net" class="govuk-link">necsu.capacitytracker@nhs.net</a> as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>Local authorities are also asked to provide any support they can to care homes and all parties should be aware of the support available via the <a rel="external" href="https://carehomes.necsu.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">Capacity Tracker website</a>.</p>

<p>Local authorities have access to full data reports via the Capacity Tracker website.</p>

<h2>Annex J: interim COVID-19 waste management measures</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<h3>Management of healthcare waste from care home settings</h3>

<p>Please note that some of the normal waste management practices are adapted to support suitable management of COVID-19 waste. These adaptions are recognised by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and the Environment Agency and have been developed in conjunction with <abbr title="Public Health England">PHE</abbr>.</p>

<p>It’s important that non-healthcare waste, for example recycling, domestic type waste, packaging etc must continue to be handled and managed as normal.</p>

<h2>Annex K: moving from the community to care homes</h2>

<p><strong>Provided by HMG</strong></p>

<p>This annex sets out a service model for testing people moving from the community into a care home. It is intended to supplement existing local arrangements. Where local arrangements go beyond the service model set out, and are working well for care homes, these should not be disrupted.</p>

<p>This information applies to asymptomatic individuals moving from the community into an adult residential care home, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h3>Prior to admission into a care home</h3>

<p>Prior to admission into a care home, the registered care home manager should ascertain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if the individual is well enough to be admitted</li>
  <li>if they have been swab tested using a PCR test (and if so when the test was conducted and the result of the test)</li>
  <li>what care and support the individual is currently receiving</li>
</ul>

<p>The care home manager should ensure the individual has not had close contact with someone with COVID-19 symptoms within the last 14 days.</p>

<h3>If a test has been conducted</h3>

<p>If a test has been conducted within 2 days of planned admission into the care home, the care home manager must share the test result with the named clinical lead assigned to the care home.</p>

<p>If a test has been conducted but it was not done within 2 days prior to admission, another test must be conducted.</p>

<h3>Confirmed positive case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>For individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 positive status, the care home manager should follow the isolation strategy set out in <a href="#annex-c" class="govuk-link">Annex C</a>. Individuals admitted from the community should be immediately isolated for 14 days, regardless of symptoms. Cohorting policies are particularly important for older care home residents (see <a href="#section-1-admission" class="govuk-link">section 1</a>).</p>

<p>Occasionally symptomatic individuals may need isolating beyond the isolation period if they have not recovered from their infection.</p>

<p>Once admitted to the care home individuals should be <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/pulse-oximetry-to-detect-early-deterioration-of-patients-with-covid-19-in-primary-and-community-care-settings/" rel="external" class="govuk-link">closely monitored</a>.</p>

<p>There will be no absolute requirement for a care home to admit a new resident to the care home. If appropriate isolation or cohorted care is not available, the care home manager should ask the individual’s local authority to secure alternative appropriate accommodation.</p>

<h3>Confirmed negative case of COVID-19</h3>

<p>For individuals with a confirmed COVID-19 negative status, from a test taken less than 2 days prior to admission, a 14-day period of isolation is still recommended, particularly in care homes for older residents.</p>

<p>Further guidance on isolation of residents is in <a class="govuk-link" href="#section-1-admission">section 1</a>.</p>

<h3>Conducting a test on admission</h3>

<p>If a test has not been conducted or has been conducted over 2 days prior to the planned admission, the individual should be tested. The care home manager is responsible for the decision on how to test the individual.</p>

<p>The care home manager should work with the named clinical lead assigned to the care home to access a test kit and ensure the individual can be appropriately isolated. The care home manager could utilise testing capacity from <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> pillar 2, local testing capacity or an alternative as they see fit. If the care home manager feels pillar 1 testing capacity is most appropriate, they should contact their local director of public health and organise testing using available capacity.</p>

<p>If the test result is positive, the care home manager should inform the individual’s GP and, if they have already been transferred to the care home, the local <abbr title="health protection team">HPT</abbr> as they would with any symptomatic individual in their home. This will help support the individual’s care and local risk assessment.</p>

<h3>Urgent admissions</h3>

<p>For urgent admissions (regardless of symptoms) the individual should be tested upon arrival and care home managers should follow the isolation guidance, set out in <a class="govuk-link" href="#annex-c">Annex C</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<h3>Case study: Sheffield</h3>

<p>The Sheffield Health and Social Care Swabbing Service is a multi-agency collaboration between Primary Care Sheffield (PCS), NHS Sheffield CCG and Sheffield City Council, drawing in expertise and resource from Sheffield Children’s and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.</p>

<p>Working in partnership, they have established a daily mobile swabbing team who will work on an on-call basis to provide support to the care homes when a person has been identified as needing admission to a care home from their own home. For urgent admissions, they will be isolated in the care home and swabbed by this team. For planned admissions the person may be swabbed at home by the team prior to admission.</p>

<p>The team are operational 7 days a week. A single team is on duty each day consisting of 2 registered nurses or a registered nurse and a healthcare assistant, wearing full appropriate PPE. A test can be booked by a registered care home manager or the individual’s GP, prior to admission, using a dedicated helpline number.</p>

<p>The team on duty use test kits from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals (STH) laboratory. Once the individual has been swabbed, the team return the sample to the STH laboratory along with the patient details. If the patient lacks capacity, an appropriate person or Power of Attorney should be the named person to receive the results. It is the patient’s (or their nominated appropriate person) responsibility to inform the registered care home manager of the result.</p>

<p>The team will require the patient’s name, date of birth, current address, registered GP practice details to register and the address of the care home the patient will be admitted to, in order to return the test result.</p>

<p>Results are communicated to care home and registered GP of patient within 48 hours of the test. PCS informs the care home of the result either by email if documented or by telephone call to the care home directly. PCS also adds results to the patient record.</p>

<p>This service is offered to all care homes within the locality. To highlight the mobile swabbing service communications were put out in GP bulletins and registered care home managers were contacted directly. The mobile swabbing service is publicised on a webpage, run by Sheffield City Council.</p>
