<h2>What is generally known about myocarditis and pericarditis</h2>

<p>Myocarditis and pericarditis are both inflammatory conditions of the heart. The incidence of myocarditis is difficult to ascertain as most cases are mild and are often not well investigated.</p>

<p>In one study from the UK it was estimated that between 1998 and 2017 there were 36.5 per 100,000 NHS admissions with myocarditis, with the numbers increasing with each year since 2004. In 2017 it was estimated that there were <a rel="external" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.140.suppl_1.11463" class="govuk-link">about 2,000 hospital admissions for myocarditis</a>. Overall, two-thirds of cases were in men, and men were significantly younger (median age 33) compared to women. The most common type of myocarditis is an <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/4/603">acute lymphocytic myocarditis, often caused by viral infection</a>.</p>

<p>Presentation of acute myocarditis is variable, ranging from subclinical disease to heart failure and patients can present with chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations and fatigue. Most patients respond well to standard treatment, and the prognosis is good. However, it can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure, with evidence implicating it in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062009000966?via%3Dihub" class="govuk-link" rel="external">12% of sudden deaths in adults aged under 40</a>.</p>

<p>Acute pericarditis can have a similar presentation to myocarditis, with chest pain and shortness of breath, and patients can also have concurrent myocardial involvement, known as myopericarditis. Treatment of pericarditis is aimed at the cause, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<abbr title="non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs">NSAIDs</abbr>) the mainstay of therapy for viral, idiopathic and pericarditis associated with a systemic inflammatory disease. The long-term prognosis of pericarditis is good, but it can become recurrent and <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/101/14/1159">rarely patients can develop constrictive pericarditis</a>.</p>

<h3>Can myocarditis or pericarditis be caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) infection?</h3>

<p>There have been a number of reports of cardiac involvement following COVID-19 infection in hospitalised patients, with approximately 18% of hospitalised patients suffering myocardial injury in the acute phase.</p>

<p>In a US study of 1,597 athletes with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, 0.31% were diagnosed with myocarditis using a symptom-based screening strategy and 2.3% were diagnosed with clinical or subclinical myocarditis using cardiac magnetic resonance screening. Of those who had repeat imaging, 11 of 27 athletes had complete resolution of myocarditis signs (40.7% – range between studies, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160916/" class="govuk-link" rel="external">4 to 10 weeks with median [interquartile range] of 8, 3.5 weeks</a>.</p>

<p>In another study of college athletes in the US, of the 3,018 athletes who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, cardiac involvement was estimated at between 0.5% to 3.0%. During the 113-day follow-up period, there were <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300154/" rel="external">no adverse cardiac events in those with myocarditis</a>.</p>

<h3>Is there an association of myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination?</h3>

<p>From analysis of UK and international data, there has been a signal of an increase of cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used extensively in other countries, including the US and Israel.</p>

<p>In the US, 296 million doses of <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) had been given by 11 June with 1,226 reports of myocarditis after vaccination (the US data analysis has included all cases of myocarditis, pericarditis and myopericarditis under myocarditis). In those with reported myocarditis, the median age was 26 years and the median time to onset was 3 days after the vaccination.</p>

<p>In <a rel="external" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730" class="govuk-link">Israel</a>, between December 2020 and May 2021, there were 142 reports of myocarditis within 21 days of the first dose or within 30 days of the second dose, with 5,442,696 individuals having received at least one dose of vaccine and 5,125,635 having received 2 doses. Acute symptoms were mild in 95% of cases and the standardised incidence ratio was 5.34 (95% CI, 4.48 to 6.40) being highest in 16 to 19-year-old males after the second dose (13.60; 95% CI, 9.30 to 19.20). There have been higher incidences in younger males, and most cases were reported after the second vaccination.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110737" rel="external" class="govuk-link">study investigating myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination</a> in the largest healthcare organisation in Israel, 76% of cases were described as mild and 22% as intermediate. Of 10 patients with left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography on hospital discharge, 5 had normal function on subsequent testing at median follow-up of 25 days with testing not available for the other 5 patients. Median follow-up after discharge was 83 days with 1 patient readmitted to hospital and 1 death of unknown cause after discharge.</p>

<p>In the US, among those 1,194 individuals with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, where age was known, 687 were aged under 30 years, amongst the 1,212 individuals where gender was known, 923 were male, and for those 1,094 individuals for which number of vaccine doses is known, 76% of cases developed myocarditis after dose 2. Reporting rates were 40.6 cases per million second doses of <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> COVID-19 vaccines for males aged 12 to 29 years and 2.4 per million second doses for males aged 30 or older. For females their reported rates were 4.2 and 1.0 per million second doses in these age groups and the highest reporting rates were among males aged 12 to 17 and those aged 18 to 24 years.</p>

<p>In more <a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/media/153514/download">recent data</a> up to 6 October 2021, there were 797 cases in males in the 7 days after either dose 1 or dose 2 and 138 in females. Up to this date, 169,740,953 doses of <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccines have been given to males and 193,215,313 doses to females. The highest rates were seen in men under 25 after the second dose. Following the second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech for males the rates per one million doses were 39.9 for those aged 12 to 15, 69.1 for those aged 16 to 17 and 36.8 for those aged 18 to 24. Following the second dose of Moderna the rates in men aged 18 to 24 were 38.5 per one million doses. In men aged 50 or older and women aged 30 or older, the rates did not exceed the expected background rates.</p>

<p>Follow-up of cases in the US, Israel and the UK are ongoing to better understand the natural history and sequelae following the acute episode. To date, in the UK, it appears that most individuals respond well to standard treatment, although there is limited if any follow-up beyond 3 months.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">CDC</abbr>) further analysed US myocarditis data in those aged under 30 years – 96% of cases were hospitalised but there were no deaths. However, 5 deaths have been reported in the European Economic Area in individuals of advanced age or with concomitant disease as well as <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730" class="govuk-link" rel="external">one death in Israel</a>, and so it is important that healthcare professionals are aware of this condition and the advice regarding management of suspected cases following vaccination.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination">Clinical guidance on the investigation and management of suspected cases of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination</a> has been developed by an expert working group including representation from paediatric cardiologists, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and Royal College of General Practitioners.</p>

<h3>What is the UK data on myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination?</h3>

<p>Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the UK following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p>As of 8 December 2021, in the UK there were 507 reports of myocarditis and 365 reports of pericarditis following use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 171 reports of myocarditis and 198 reports of pericarditis following use of the AstraZeneca (<abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr>) vaccine, and 111 reports of myocarditis and 63 reports of pericarditis following use of the Moderna vaccine to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (<abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>). Many of these are self-reports, and have not been confirmed by medical adjudication.</p>

<p>The overall reporting rates for all ages after both the first and second doses of Pfizer/BioNTech are 11 myocarditis cases per million doses and 8 pericarditis cases per million doses, and for Moderna the rate is 39 myocarditis cases per million doses and 22 pericarditis cases per million doses. The reporting rate for suspected myocarditis and pericarditis is highest in the 18 to 29 age group. Three fatal cases have been reported following Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 2 following <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine and none following Moderna vaccine. Most of the fatal cases had underlying illnesses that could provide alternative explanations. Given the extensive use of the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine in the UK programme, the cases reported after the <abbr title="AstraZeneca">AZ</abbr> vaccine are thought to reflect the expected background rate of these conditions with no evidence of a signal. The latest information on suspected cases can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting" class="govuk-link"><abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr>’s weekly summary of yellow card reporting</a>.</p>

<p>Up to 8 December 2021, 24.8 million first doses and 21.2 second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech have been administered and 1.5 million first doses and 1.4 million second doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered. There are similar reporting rates of myocarditis after dose 1 and 2 for Pfizer/BioNTech but the rate is higher following the dose 2 of Moderna compared to dose 1 for those aged 18 to 39. The reporting rates for Moderna currently lack precision due to the more limited use of the Moderna vaccine in the UK.</p>

<h3>What is the outcome of patients with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination?</h3>
<p>The existing evidence base shows that most patients with myocarditis post vaccination respond well to standard treatment for the acute episode, and the prognosis of the myocarditis is good. However, it may have long-term consequences and studies are in progress to further understand the potential longer-term consequences with follow-up at 3 months and 6 months.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis</h2>
<p>Myocarditis and pericarditis present with new onset of chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart.</p>

<p>Anyone who develops these symptoms within 10 days of a COVID-19 vaccination should urgently seek medical assistance. Most of these cases are mild and recover in a short time period with standard treatment.</p>

<h2>Reporting myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination</h2>
<p>It is very important that all suspected cases are reported to the <abbr title="Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency">MHRA</abbr> using the <a rel="external" href="https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="govuk-link">COVID-19 Yellow Card scheme</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, a serum sample should be collected from any patient that is suspected of experiencing myocarditis or pericarditis following any COVID-19 vaccination and sent to UKHSA Colindale. Please use the code ‘Heart Inflammation’ or ‘Myocarditis’ for easy identification and which vaccine dose (and vaccine brand) the symptoms developed after.</p>

<p>Samples should be sent with a completed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-enhanced-surveillance-of-cases-in-vaccinated-individuals" class="govuk-link">E59 sample submission form</a> to:</p>

<h3>Why are serum samples being requested if myocarditis is suspected after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine?</h3>
<p>The samples will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to determine whether the individual had previous COVID-19 infection and to help support the individual risk benefit for subsequent doses of vaccine. Assessment of the risk benefit for an individual should consider age, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection, and current levels of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>The mechanism of action and risk of recurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis with a further dose of vaccine are being investigated. If an individual develops myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination, they should be assessed by an appropriate clinician to determine whether it is likely to be vaccine related.</p>

<p>The results will be sent to the requesting doctor to help inform the decision making process as to whether further vaccination is appropriate, as those who have had COVID-19 infection develop higher antibody levels post-vaccination and have increased protection from serious infection and hospitalisation.  There is no time limit to when a sample may be submitted following the episode.</p>

<h2>Treatment and guidance</h2>
<p>Most individuals respond well to standard treatment and recover quickly. Suspected cases should urgently seek medical assistance, and follow-up as necessary.</p>

<p>Further <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals" class="govuk-link">guidance on treatment and referral for primary care and emergency care clinicians</a> is available. This guidance was developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and royal colleges and is endorsed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and Royal College of GPs.</p>

<h3>If a patient has had myocarditis or pericarditis following a COVID-19 vaccination, should they have subsequent doses, including second and booster doses?</h3>
<p>If an individual develops myocarditis or pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination they should be assessed by an appropriate clinician to determine whether it is likely to be vaccine related, and arrange for a blood sample to be taken, and sent to Colindale for testing (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#testing">reporting suspected cases</a>). Samples should still be sent if myocarditis or pericarditis develops after a second or booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>The mechanism of action and risk of recurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis with a further dose of vaccine are being investigated. For those that experience myocarditis or pericarditis within 2 weeks of the first dose of an <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine, testing for N antibody may indicate prior exposure to COVID-19. Given that the risks of myocarditis are higher in younger adults and that these individuals are likely to be well protected against severe outcomes, the benefit from a second dose is likely to be more limited. Assessment of the risk benefit for an individual should consider age, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection and current levels of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>Where N antibody is negative or in other circumstances where a full course is considered necessary, a second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine can be considered once the patient has fully recovered. Emerging evidence suggests that an interval of at least 12 weeks should be observed. In light of the higher reported rates of myocarditis following the Moderna vaccine, Pfizer/BioNTech is preferred over Moderna. This is supported by a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-068665" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Danish study</a> demonstrating a significantly increased risk of myocarditis following vaccination with Moderna in those aged under 40 (adjusted hazard ratio 5.24 (95% confidence interval 2.47 to 11.12); absolute rate 5.7 (3.3 to 9.3) per 100,000 people aged 12 to 39 within 28 days of vaccination). With Pfizer vaccination, a significantly increased rate of myocarditis was seen with women only (absolute rate was 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 2.6) per 100,000 individuals aged 12 to 39 years within 28 days of vaccination).</p>

<p>AstraZeneca should not be offered to those who have previously received an <abbr title="messenger ribonucleic acid">mRNA</abbr> vaccine given the risk (albeit rare) of thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia syndrome. Similar considerations apply to individuals who experience myocarditis after the second dose, where boosting with Pfizer/BioNTech may be considered for those at higher risk of the complications of COVID-19 infection.</p>

<h3>Should someone who has had myocarditis or pericarditis previously have a COVID-19 vaccination?</h3>
<p>A history of myocarditis or pericarditis unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination is not a contraindication to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>The mechanism of action for causing these conditions following administration of a COVID-19 vaccine is being investigated and there is currently no evidence that people with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis are at increased risk of a recurrence following COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

<p>The risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be discussed with the patient so that they can make an informed decision. Assessment of the risk benefit for an individual should consider age, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection and current levels of COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<h2>Should individuals refrain from exercising following vaccination?</h2>
<p>There is no evidence that strenuous exercise increases the risk of developing myocarditis following vaccination. Individuals can resume activities that are normal for them if they feel well. This includes exercise activities that they would normally do. If they feel unwell or very tired, then they should rest until they feel better. Anyone developing chest pain, palpitations or dizziness should seek <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination/myocarditis-and-pericarditis-after-covid-19-vaccination-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals">medical advice</a>.</p>

<p>If an individual has been diagnosed with myocarditis or pericarditis, they should follow the advice of their clinician about when to resume exercise.</p>
