<p>22 September 2022</p>

<p>Dear community pharmacy contractors</p>

<p>We write to update you on the agreement for both year 4 and year 5 of the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework (<abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr>) 2019 to 2024 5-year deal between the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (<abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr>), the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>) and NHS England (<abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr>).</p>

<p>Firstly, we would like to thank all pharmacy contractors for their continued work and support. In summer 2021, we wrote to you to set out the agreement for year 3 of the 5-year deal. Since then, you have successfully continued the implementation of the 5-year deal by increasing the offer from community pharmacy. You have expanded the New Medicine Service (<abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr>) to more therapeutic areas and introduced the Blood Pressure Check Service and the Smoking Cessation Service (<abbr title="Smoking Cessation Service">SCS</abbr>) following hospital discharge. At the same time, community pharmacy continued to support the national coronavirus (COVID-19) response with the Medicines Delivery Service, Pharmacy Collect, over 24.5 million COVID-19 vaccinations and over 4.8 million flu vaccinations. That is an amazing effort and has been recognised by the NHS and health ministers.</p>

<p>The joint annual review of the 5-year deal undertaken last year confirmed this good progress, while raising significant capacity and funding concerns. <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> set out contractors’ concerns on the rising demand, economic and workforce pressures, and their fears about future viability and the impact on quality of service for patients.</p>

<p>Within that context and following challenging but constructive discussions, we have agreed a package for the remaining years of the 5-year deal. This 2-year agreement continues to support measured and incremental expansion in clinical service provision from community pharmacies. Alongside this, recognising the pressures facing the sector and the importance of these services to the health system, <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> has been able to provide for a modest and non-recurrent additional investment of £100 million across years 4 and 5 to support contractors.</p>

<p>We will not be seeking to introduce any further clinical services beyond those contained in this letter from within the current funding envelope.</p>

<h3>New and expanded services</h3>

<p>Building on progress made in GP referrals via the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (<abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr>) and hospital referrals under the Discharge Medicine Service (<abbr title="Discharge Medicines Service">DMS</abbr>), <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> is providing project support to NHS trusts to facilitate implementation of the <abbr title="Smoking Cessation Service">SCS</abbr> and the <abbr title="Discharge Medicines Service">DMS</abbr>, and is also funding new integrated care system (<abbr title="integrated care system">ICS</abbr>) community pharmacy clinical lead roles to support implementation of all clinical services. Given the significant capacity concerns raised by <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> during negotiations, we will only be introducing services that build on existing services and that pave the way for community pharmacy’s future.</p>

<p>From 11 January 2023, we will introduce Tier 1 of a Pharmacy Contraception Service, enabling community pharmacists to provide ongoing management, via a Patient Group Direction, of routine oral contraception that was initiated in general practice or a sexual health clinic. This will allow people greater choice and access when considering continuing their current form of contraception.</p>

<p>The fees for this service are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a fee for each consultation of £18</li>
  <li>a set-up fee of £900, paid in instalments</li>
</ul>

<p>From March 2023, we will expand the <abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr> to enable urgent and emergency care settings to refer patients to a community pharmacist for a consultation for minor illness or urgent medicine supply. The fee for this service will be the existing <abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr> fee of £14.</p>

<p>From 19 April 2023, subject to positive evaluation of an ongoing pilot, we will expand the <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr> to include antidepressants to enable patients who are newly prescribed an antidepressant to receive extra support from their community pharmacist.</p>

<p>From 4 October 2023, subject to positive evaluation, we will introduce Tier 2 of a Pharmacy Contraception Service, enabling community pharmacists to also initiate oral contraception, via a Patient Group Direction, and provide ongoing clinical checks and annual reviews.</p>

<p>To recognise the valuable skill mix that exists in community pharmacy, the service specifications for the Blood Pressure Check Service and <abbr title="Smoking Cessation Service">SCS</abbr> will be amended to also allow delivery by pharmacy technicians. Other services or elements of services that may be deliverable by pharmacy technicians will also be reviewed during the remaining years of the deal. No changes will be made to current fee levels.</p>

<h3>Pharmacy Quality Scheme (<abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will introduce updated Pharmacy Quality Schemes (<abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr>) in both year 4 and year 5 with annual funding maintained at £75 million. Year 4 <abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr> will commence on 10 October 2022. These schemes aim to consolidate and build on existing criteria to support the NHS recovery from COVID-19 and wider national health priorities.</p>

<p>In year 4, the scheme will build on previous criteria around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>managing risk (red flags, sepsis and COVID-19 transmission)</li>
  <li>effective management of respiratory disease</li>
  <li>antimicrobial stewardship</li>
  <li>referrals to weight management services</li>
</ul>

<p>New criteria will be aimed at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supporting those suffering domestic abuse</li>
  <li>level 3 safeguarding skills</li>
  <li>improved access to medicines to support palliative and end of life care</li>
  <li>training on early cancer diagnosis</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 5 will build on year 4. It will also include a re-audit of the safe use of anticoagulants, and new criteria aiming to increase awareness of the availability of defibrillators and understanding of how they should be used, and to increase working with local systems on health inequalities.</p>

<p>Summaries of the year 4 and year 5 criteria and training requirements for year 4 are included in Annex A: Pharmacy Quality Scheme.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

<p>To deliver the non-recurrent additional investment of £100 million set out above, additional to the agreed <abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr> funding, allowed medicine margin will be increased by a total of £100 million over the 2 financial years 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024. This will help to improve contractors’ cash flow as this additional allowed medicine margin is balanced against margin over delivery from previous years.</p>

<p>In year 4 and year 5, there will still be unallocated funding for future clinical services. We have agreed that this will be delivered to contractors through the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the growing volumes of new and expanded clinical services</li>
  <li>the payment of a flat fee from April 2023 to all pharmacy contractors who dispense at least 101 items a month up to a national total of £70 million on an annual basis (this amount reduces if clinical service volumes grow beyond our forecasts and all unallocated funding is spent on new services)</li>
  <li>any remaining unallocated funding will continue to be paid out as a transitional payment until the end of year 5, or until the unallocated funding is fully deployed against growing service volumes and/or by the flat fee, which we will jointly monitor</li>
</ul>

<p>Since October 2021, the transitional payment has been based on both dispensing volume and service delivery. To reflect the direction of travel set out in the 5-year deal and reward pharmacy contractors that have adopted clinical services, from November 2022 the service element of the transitional payment will be increased to 75% of the transitional payment. The service element will be calculated based on the total income received for advanced services (excluding flu vaccination) provided.</p>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>HM Revenue and Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr>) has confirmed that services delivered by pharmacy technicians are exempt from VAT so we will revise service specifications to support delivery by pharmacy technicians, recognising their valuable role in clinical service delivery.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> continues to work with HM Treasury and <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> to resolve any differences in VAT treatment of services supervised by registered pharmacy professionals when compared with other healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Discussions with <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> about the VAT treatment of the <abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr> are ongoing but <abbr title="HM Revenue and Customs">HMRC</abbr> has confirmed that the following are out of scope for VAT:</p>

<ul>
  <li><abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr></li>
  <li>Pharmacy Access Scheme</li>
  <li>transitional payment</li>
  <li>service set-up fees</li>
</ul>

<p>We also expect there to be a confirmation around VAT treatment of serious shortage protocol reimbursement.</p>

<h3>Reimbursement reform</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has committed to reviewing the implementation of the price concession process as a matter of priority.</p>

<p>During year 4 and year 5, we will also continue to implement the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/community-pharmacy-drug-reimbursement-reform">reimbursement reforms</a>. This will ensure that pharmacy contractors have more equitable access to medicine margin and improve pharmacy contractors’ cash flow by ensuring reimbursement prices better reflect market prices. It will also improve value for money for the taxpayer. The detail of a new mechanism to establish category A reimbursement prices will be finalised with the <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> by the end of 2022 with implementation as soon as practicable.</p>

<h3>Regulatory changes</h3>

<p>The terms of service have been changed to make completion of Health Education England’s annual community pharmacy workforce survey mandatory from 2022 onwards. This will ensure that robust workforce data is available to support future planning, training and investment decisions.</p>

<p>To free up time for the workforce survey, the requirement to carry out an annual patient questionnaire has also been removed from the terms of service. Instead, <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will undertake national patient engagement on pharmacy services.</p>

<p>Market entry provisions have been changed to streamline applications for consolidations and the required notification period for changes to supplementary hours will be reduced. There will also be changes to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/primary-care/pharmacy/pharmacy-manual/" rel="external">Pharmacy Manual</a> on fitness information, emergency closures and changing core hours.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will also support efficiency by taking forward several changes to legislation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/hub-and-spoke-dispensing">a public consultation on legislative changes to make hub and spoke dispensing models accessible to all community pharmacies</a> closed on 8 June 2022 and <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> is considering the responses. Subject to the proposed medicines legislation amendments being made, we will have further discussions and progress any necessary amendments to the NHS pharmaceutical services legislative framework with the aim of enabling implementation of these within NHS pharmaceutical services as soon as possible</li>
  <li>subject to making the changes to medicines legislation as proposed in the recent consultation on original pack dispensing and whole pack dispensing of sodium valproate, we will have further discussions and progress any necessary amendments to the NHS terms of service and reimbursement arrangements as soon as possible</li>
  <li>subject to the views of the Commission on Human Medicines, <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will launch a public consultation on legislative changes to allow pharmacy technicians to make use of Patient Group Directions</li>
  <li>
<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> will also launch a public consultation on legislative changes to enable community pharmacies to make better use of the available skill mix in pharmacies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beyond the 5-year deal</h3>

<p>The 2-year agreement for year 4 and year 5 concludes the 5-year deal, allowing <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>, <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> and <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> to consider what comes after the 5-year deal. All 3 organisations agree that we should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>build on what we have achieved under the 5-year deal</li>
  <li>continue to make the best possible use of the knowledge and skills of pharmacy teams</li>
  <li>aim to expand clinical services in community pharmacy</li>
</ul>

<p>The experience of the existing referral pathways from GPs and hospitals, and the management and supply of medicines offers exciting prospects for further service development, both nationally and locally.</p>

<h3>Economic analysis and <abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr> evaluation</h3>

<p>An independent evaluation of <abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr> and its outcomes will inform future developments of the scheme.</p>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will continue to work with <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> and contractors to further their understanding of the sector using more comprehensive data, and engage in discussions on issues affecting the future of the community pharmacy sector.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will commission an economic analysis of NHS pharmaceutical services through an independent review, using data provided by contractors, and will work with <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> on the review. This review will help inform the negotiation of the future contractual framework for community pharmacy.</p>

<h3>Action to start to relieve contractor pressure</h3>

<p><abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> and <abbr title="NHS England">NHSE</abbr> will also continue our current work with <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> on what more can be done to relieve the current pressures contractors are facing.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We will continue to collaborate on finalising the arrangements set out in this letter.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Alette Addison, Deputy Director, Pharmacy, Dental and Optical, Department of Health and Social Care</p>

<p>Ali Sparke, Director, Dentistry, Community Pharmacy and Optometry, NHS England</p>
