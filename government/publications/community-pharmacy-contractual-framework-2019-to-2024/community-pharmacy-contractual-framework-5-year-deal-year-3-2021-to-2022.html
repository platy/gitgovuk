<p>23 August 2021</p>

<p>Dear community pharmacy contractors,</p>

<p>We write to update you on the agreement for year 3 of the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework (<abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr>) 5-year deal between the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (<abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr>), the Department of Health and Social Care (<abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr>), and NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr>).</p>

<p>The pandemic has meant that the past year and a half has been an extraordinary challenge for the NHS including community pharmacy. Despite the challenges, you continued to serve your communities, staying open to ensure access to medicines and healthcare. You stepped up when needed with the medicines delivery service and Pharmacy Collect. You vaccinated more people against flu than ever before and, community pharmacy has a growing role in COVID-19 vaccination. We want to thank you for your work over this period.</p>

<h3>A year of consolidation and recovery</h3>

<p>Our 3 organisations have been working together in recent months on the detail of year 3. Those discussions were challenging but have shown that we jointly remain committed to the vision in the 5-year deal for pharmacy to be more integrated in the NHS, provide more clinical services, be the first port of call for healthy living support as well as minor illnesses, to support managing demand in general practice and urgent care settings. This enhanced role for community pharmacy is even more important now as it will support recovery of the NHS from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges the pandemic caused, we managed to jointly accomplish much of what we set out to achieve in year 2. All pharmacies are now Healthy Living Pharmacies providing healthy living advice and support and health promotion in their local communities. They have been actively supporting weight management through conversations about BMI and have also prepared themselves to better help people with suicidal feelings.</p>

<p>We expanded the Community Pharmacist Consultation Service (<abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr>) to GP practices, and introduced the Discharge Medicines Service (<abbr title="Discharge Medicines Service">DMS</abbr>) to improve medicines safety on discharge from hospital. Work is ongoing to support the continued implementation during the remainder of 2021 to 2022. Both services confirm community pharmacy’s role at the heart of the NHS and are supporting the recovery of the NHS from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Further work is underway to develop the <abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr> referral routes from Emergency Departments and Urgent Treatment Centres and work with systems to further embed these services in year 3 as part of integrated care pathways across primary care networks (<abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr>).</p>

<h3>New services</h3>

<p>In September 2021 we will expand the New Medicine Service (<abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr>) to include the following additional therapeutic areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hypercholesterolaemia</li>
  <li>osteoporosis</li>
  <li>gout</li>
  <li>heart failure</li>
  <li>glaucoma</li>
  <li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
  <li>epilepsy</li>
  <li>urinary incontinence or retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The cap will be increased from 0.5% to 1% of monthly prescription volume and additional bandings included. Further therapeutic areas will be piloted through the Pharmacy Integration Fund as part of a fully integrated service model.</p>

<p>An additional catch-up <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr> is being introduced to provide the best patient outcomes for individuals that might have missed this support as a consequence of the pandemic. This catch-up <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr> will also support patients identified through the Pharmacy Quality Scheme (<abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr>) who have missed inhaler technique checks to optimise use of their inhaler.</p>

<p>In October 2021, or as soon as possible thereafter, we anticipate introducing the Hypertension Case-Finding Service as an advanced service to support the NHS Long Term Plan ambitions for prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>This service will have 2 stages. The first is identifying people at risk of hypertension and offering them blood pressure monitoring (clinic check). The second stage, where clinically indicated, is offering ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (<abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr>). The blood pressure test results will then be shared with the patient’s GP to then inform a potential diagnosis of hypertension.</p>

<p>The fees for this service are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a set-up fee of £440</li>
  <li>a fee for each clinic check of £15</li>
  <li>a fee for each ambulatory monitoring of £45</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, incentive fees across years 3, 4 and 5 of the <abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr> 5-year agreement, will be available. Pharmacies must reach a threshold of <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> activity to trigger the payment of the incentive fee. An incentive fee of £1,000 will be available when the threshold is reached in the first year, followed by a payment of £400 in the subsequent years if the pharmacy reaches the thresholds for those years.</p>

<p>The initial incentive will be triggered by delivering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5 <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> intervention in 2021 to 2022</li>
  <li>15 <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> interventions in 2022 to 2023</li>
  <li>20 <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> interventions in 2023 to 2024</li>
</ul>

<p>This will require identification of people in whom <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> is indicated. Pharmacies will need to identify people with high clinic blood pressure measurements who then accept <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> with accompanying support and advice.</p>

<p>Contractors who sign up after year 3 must achieve the <abbr title="ambulatory blood pressure monitoring">ABPM</abbr> activity thresholds specified for the given financial year and will receive £1,000 as a first payment. If a contractor signs up in year 3 and fails to do 5 ABPMs, they can earn £1,000 by doing 15 ABPMs in year 4. These incentive payments will be funded separately by <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> to incentivise case finding in line with the ambition outlined in the NHS Long Term Plan.</p>

<p>In January 2022, or as soon as possible thereafter, we will introduce a Smoking Cessation Service as an advanced service. This service enables NHS trusts to refer patients discharged from hospital to a community pharmacy of their choice to continue their smoking cessation care pathway, including providing medication and behavioural support as required; in line with the NHS Long Term Plan care model for tobacco addiction.</p>

<p>The fees for this service are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a set-up fee of £1,000</li>
  <li>a fee for the first consultation of £30</li>
  <li>a fee for the last consultation of £40 for each patient</li>
  <li>a fee for each interim patient consultation of £10</li>
</ul>

<p>We have agreed to introduce a core dataset for all clinical services.  This data will help understand whether commissioned services are achieving the desired aims and patient benefits, inform priority-setting for the development of new clinical services and provide insight into the care needs of local populations.</p>

<p>The data will be submitted by contractors to the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) automatically through the Manage Your Service (<abbr title="Manage Your Service">MYS</abbr>) portal using an application programming interface (<abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>) that will take data securely and directly from pharmacy clinical software systems. The intention is for this to be in place before the end of 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>As part of the 5-year deal there was a commitment to test a new service to improve access to palliative care medicines. <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> will work with <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr> to explore the role of community pharmacy supporting patients and their carers at the end of life as part of palliative care networks.</p>

<h3>Pharmacy Quality Scheme (<abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> will introduce an updated <abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr> from 1 September 2021 with funding maintained at £75 million. In 2021 to 2022 the <abbr title="Pharmacy Quality Scheme">PQS</abbr> will focus on priorities that support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to participate, pharmacy contractors will need to have completed at least 20 <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr> provisions and met requirements related to patient safety and managing risks related to transmission of COVID-19, missing red flag symptoms that could signify serious underlying disease in over-the-counter consultations and missing symptoms that could indicate sepsis.</p>

<p>The quality criteria include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying people who may benefit from weight management advice and onward referral, including to the recently introduced NHS Digital Weight Management Programme</li>
  <li>training regarding health inequalities and producing an action plan to actively promote COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly in Black, Asian and minority ethnic (<abbr title="Black, Asian and minority ethnic">BAME</abbr>) and low-uptake communities</li>
  <li>training to improve skills on the provision of remote consultations</li>
  <li>enhancing antimicrobial stewardship using the Target antibiotic checklist</li>
  <li>an anticoagulant audit to enhance patient safety</li>
  <li>engagement with <abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> to increase uptake within their population of flu vaccinations</li>
  <li>checking inhaler technique, as part of catch-up <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr>, ensuring patients have personalised asthma action plans and use of spacers in children, and encouraging return of unwanted and used inhalers for disposal to protect the environment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transitional payment</h3>

<p>The intention of the 5-year deal was that the transitional payment would not continue past the end of year 2. However, the pandemic has delayed and disrupted plans for service introduction and planned legislative changes that would support pharmacies in making further dispensing efficiencies. It also required introduction of infection protection and control measures and changed the behaviour of patients and the public in how they utilise pharmacy services. Therefore, we have agreed to continue a transitional payment in year 3 only.</p>

<p>We have also agreed that the transitional payment should reflect the direction of travel set out in the 5-year deal and reward those pharmacy contractors that have adopted the new clinical service model. From 1 October 2021, the transitional payment will have 2 parts. One part will be based on a contractor’s dispensing volume, as it is now. The other part will be based on a contractor’s service delivery.</p>

<p>Contractors will only be eligible for the service delivery part of the transitional payment if they have claimed payment for the <abbr title="New Medicine Service">NMS</abbr> at least once in the previous month and if they were actively registered for <abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr> in the previous month.</p>

<p>We expect the transitional payment in year 3 to be used by contractors for the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>primary care network (<abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr>) and integrated care system (ICS) engagement: to support further local integration of services and strengthening relationships with <abbr title="primary care networks">PCNs</abbr> with the aim of increasing uptake of clinical services</li>
  <li>digital transformation: many pharmacies are reviewing their operations with a view to becoming digitally mature organisations. Electronic Prescription Service usage in pharmacies now represents more than 95% of all prescriptions dispensed. As part of this digital transition, pharmacies should explore a range of further measures to deliver element(s) of their essential services digitally For example, reducing reliance on paper in dispensing workflows, introducing the provision of electronic communications to patients around prescription collections, and embracing the ability to offer telephone or video consultations for clinical services</li>
  <li>dispensing efficiencies: to support contractors in preparing for a more service-based role, pharmacy contractors are required to look at business processes and to consider, for example, efficient skill mix, automated dispensing systems, planning and predicting workload and engaging on hub and spoke changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Funding delivery</h3>

<p>To ensure delivery of the agreed financial settlement taking into account the outturn for 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 and forecast for 2021 to 2022, £12.2 million will be added to the medicines margin in the next quarter (October to December 2021), the Single Activity Fee will increase by 2p to £1.29 from August 2021 to March 2022, and an additional £10 million will be allocated to the transitional payment in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>VAT</h3>

<p>We recognise that the current VAT legislation is not reflective of the changing role of community pharmacy. <abbr title="Department of Health and Social Care">DHSC</abbr> has committed to work urgently with HM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs in year 3 to seek urgent resolution to ensure that pharmaceutical services delivered under pharmacist supervision are VAT exempt.</p>

<p>The fees for the hypertension case finding service and the smoking cessation service are based on service specifications based on delivery by pharmacists. If the service specifications are renegotiated to enable delivery by other staff, then the fees will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Pharmacy Access Scheme (<abbr title="Pharmacy Access Scheme">PhAS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>A revised <abbr title="Pharmacy Access Scheme">PhAS</abbr> will be introduced with payments under the new scheme starting in January 2022, with the first payment made with the January 2022 reconciliation payment paid on 1 April 2022. To be eligible, a pharmacy must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be on the Pharmaceutical List as of 31 March 2021. Distance-selling pharmacies (<abbr title="distance-selling pharmacies">DSPs</abbr>), dispensing appliance contractors, local pharmaceutical services (<abbr title="local pharmaceutical services">LPS</abbr>) contractors, and dispensing doctors are not eligible for the scheme</li>
  <li>be more than 1 mile from the next nearest pharmacy, using pharmacy to pharmacy distance calculations based on Ordnance Survey Road network analysis or be more than 0.8 mile away from the next nearest pharmacy if located in the most deprived areas (that is, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile 1 to 2)</li>
  <li>have received at least 1,200 Single Activity Fees in 2019 to 2020 and was not in the top 30% largest pharmacies by dispensing volume in 2019 to 2020 (that is, received fewer than 104,789 SAFs)</li>
  <li>be registered to provide the <abbr title="Community Pharmacist Consultation Service">CPCS</abbr> by 31 December 2021 (and continue this registration to be eligible for payments)</li>
  <li>be in premises that are directly accessible to the public, that is, not in an area with restricted access - for example, beyond airport security</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligibility for <abbr title="Pharmacy Access Scheme">PhAS</abbr> will be announced in August 2021. Contractors will be able to access the distance mapping that underpinned the decision in relation to their pharmacy should they wish to do so. In January 2022, contractors will be able to apply for reviews of eligibility decisions based on accuracy and the presence of a physical feature anomaly. Contractors will be able to utilise evidence submitted and decision responses from the first review process in 2016 to 2017.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Pharmacy Access Scheme">PhAS</abbr> payment will no longer be paid as an uplift to remuneration. Instead, payments will be in bands based on a bell curve of dispensing volume. The maximum payment is set at £17,500 per year.</p>

<p><abbr title="local pharmaceutical services">LPS</abbr> pharmacies returning to the pharmaceutical list will be deemed as on the list on 31 March 2021.</p>

<p>The total funding available for the revised <abbr title="Pharmacy Access Scheme">PhAS</abbr> will not exceed £20 million per year.</p>

<h3>Regulatory changes</h3>

<p>Changes will be made to the clinical governance provisions in the terms of service in the NHS (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013 to include additional pandemic requirements. This will ensure that, following consultation with <abbr title="Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee">PSNC</abbr>, pharmacies will be required to comply with recommendations from government or <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> aimed at protecting staff and patients during a pandemic.</p>

<p>Changes will also be made to amend the market entry provisions to enable <abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSE&amp;I</abbr> to reject Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment-based applications if they provide only a minor increase in opening hours in the area and otherwise additional pharmaceutical services capacity is not needed in an area.</p>

<p>We have agreed to continue further conversations regarding the regulation of dispensing and supply of medicines taking into account novel ways of undertaking these activities, while, at the same time, ensuring the integrity of the market entry system, based on Pharmaceutical Needs Assessments. We will also continue discussions on a suitable process to deal with suspected prescription direction issues.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable, we will be seeking changes to medicines legislation to enable original pack dispensing and the wider use of hub and spoke dispensing to improve efficiencies and better use of the skill mix in pharmacy teams so that the clinical skills of pharmacists can be directed to helping patients. We will seek to enable these flexibilities within the <abbr title="Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework">CPCF</abbr> as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Reimbursement reforms</h3>

<p>Further to the proposals set out in the public consultation in 2019, we intend to progress discussions on and implement reforms to reimbursement. This will ensure that pharmacy contractors have more equitable access to medicines margin and improve pharmacy contractors’ cash flow by ensuring reimbursement prices better reflect market prices. It will also improve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<h3>Training and development</h3>

<p>We are committed to future discussions that build on the progress made to date ensuring that the clinical skills of the teams that work in pharmacies are better utilised and will work to support employers to develop the clinical skills of the community pharmacy workforce further. A further 3-year programme of education and training for <abbr title="primary care network">PCN</abbr> and community pharmacy professionals is being commissioned from Health Education England and it will include independent prescribing training for existing pharmacists.</p>

<p>The model for commissioning and funding of trainee pharmacists will be reformed as part of the overall reform of the training and education of pharmacists. From 2022 to 2023 onwards, Health Education England will support the management of the training places in community pharmacy and responsibility for administration of payments to community pharmacy contractors for trainee pharmacists.</p>

<h3>Annual review</h3>

<p>The 5-year deal committed all parties to an annual review of progress against the ambitions set out in the deal. This process has also been disrupted by the pandemic. However, we have agreed a review process which we will work on over the coming months. We will complete a review of years 1, 2 and year 3 to date, to inform our year 4 negotiations which we expect to start in late autumn.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Year 3 is the year in which we consolidate the services already introduced, continue on our path to implement the vision in the 5-year deal and make the best possible use of community pharmacy in the recovery of the NHS from COVID-19. We will collaborate on finalising the arrangements for those services to be introduced later in the year, in order to give contractors as early notice as possible of their introduction.</p>
