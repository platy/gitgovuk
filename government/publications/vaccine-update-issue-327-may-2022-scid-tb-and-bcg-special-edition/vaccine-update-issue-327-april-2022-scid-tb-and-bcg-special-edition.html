<h2>Changes to the NHS neonatal Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (<abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr>) immunisation programme</h2>

<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> immunisation programme was introduced in the UK in 1953 and has undergone several changes in response to changing trends in tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is not given as part of the routine vaccination schedule but only when a child is at increased risk of coming into contact with TB.</p>

<p>Eligible babies include all newborns whose parent/s or grandparent/s was born in a country where the annual incidence of TB is 40 per 100,000 or greater; or newborn babies living in areas of the UK where the annual incidence of TB is 40 per 100,000 or greater.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine has been offered to babies that fall into one of the above categories soon after birth, often whilst the baby is still in hospital. The evaluation of the addition of screening for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr>) to the routine newborn screening test at 5 days of age made it necessary to move the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination to when a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcome will be available, which may be available from around day 14 to 17 after birth. This is to ensure that babies with <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> are not given the live attenuated <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine which is contraindicated in these babies.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening evaluation is taking place in 6 areas across England and will cover about 60% of newborn babies (Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, London Great Ormond Street Hospital and London Southeast Thames). It is necessary to change the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> programme nationally to ensure consistency and safety for all babies across the country and to guarantee data collection for the programme. This also provides an important opportunity to improve upon the existing <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> service.</p>

<p>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (<abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr>) advised in the October 2018 meeting <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>, that the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination is moved ‘from birth to after <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcome were available, as vaccination before testing would not be acceptable’. In February 2020 <sup role="doc-noteref"><a class="govuk-link" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>, the <abbr title="Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation">JCVI</abbr> noted that moving the timing of the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination would not significantly impact on TB cases in England, and the benefits from <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening would outweigh any increase in TB disease.</p>

<h3>Main points about the changes to the programme</h3>

<p>From 1 September 2021, eligible babies born on or after this date should be offered the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine by 28 days or soon after. It is possible to arrange <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination earlier than 28 days providing the appropriate <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screen outcome is available.</p>

<p>Providers are required to check the record for a negative <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> outcome, or confirmation that the child was not offered <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening, before administering the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine. <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> immunisation appointment letters should include instructions for parents or guardians to bring the infant’s Red Book and the letter with the outcome of newborn bloodspot screening.</p>

<p>Vaccination may be administered earlier than 28 days provided that a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screen outcome is available.</p>

<p>The vaccine will continue to be available to order through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.immform.phe.gov.uk/Logon.aspx?returnurl=%2f" rel="external">ImmForm website</a>.</p>

<p>In the designated 6 areas <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> will form part of the routine newborn screening test at 5 days, with most results expected within 10 to 12 days. Those eligible babies that have participated in the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening evaluation should have received their outcome of the screening test by 28 days when the <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine is scheduled.</p>

<p>All live vaccines are contraindicated in babies with a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> diagnosis. <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening status will need to be checked before the offer of the rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) at the 8 week vaccination appointment. See <a class="govuk-link" href="#rota"><abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> evaluation on rotavirus vaccination section</a> below for details.</p>

<p><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine contains a live attenuated strain of bacterium, derived from Mycobacterium bovis. <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> Vaccine AJV (AJ Vaccines) is the only licensed vaccine in the UK.</p>

<p>The parents or guardians of any baby that has received an outcome suggesting <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> may be present will be contacted by a specialist immunology team and an appointment arranged within 1 working day of this contact. This team will recommend further diagnostic tests to confirm whether the baby has a problem with their immune system or not.</p>

<p>Following diagnostic tests and where these are negative, a letter confirming the outcome of the investigations will be issued to parents or guardians and copied to <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> and Health Visitor. This letter also confirms that vaccinations can now be given as usual including <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> and rotavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>There is no change to funding arrangements for the vaccine programme: the NHS neonatal <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> immunisation programme will continue to be funded through the Clinical Commissioning Group (<abbr title="Clinical Commissioning Group">CCG</abbr>) Maternity Tariff.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine will continue to be offered to all eligible babies. Those born on or after 1 September 2021 will follow the new schedule. The vaccine should be given to eligible babies by 28 days or soon after. This may be at an earlier opportunity providing a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcome result is available.</p>

<h3>Vaccine supply</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine will continue to be available to order through the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://portal.immform.phe.gov.uk/Logon.aspx?returnurl=%2f" rel="external">ImmForm website</a>. Please ensure you have an ImmForm account to enable access. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-register-immform-helpsheet-8">ImmForm helpsheet</a> for information on registering for an ImmForm account.</p>

<h3>
<abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> Vaccine AJV: patient group direction (<abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr>) template</h3>
<p>An updated <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/bcg-patient-group-direction-pgd-template"><abbr title="Patient Group Direction">PGD</abbr> template</a> for the administration of <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr>, was made available for NHS England and NHSI areas to adopt and authorise for their commissioned services ahead of the change in delivery of the programme to those eligible babies.</p>

<h3>Child Health Information Services (<abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr>)</h3>
<p>NHS England and NHS Improvement (<abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr>)has met with NHSX to coordinate the changes to data requirements to the <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> system to support the new <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> pathway. Neonatal <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> eligibility data will be recorded on <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr>, which will provide a cohort denominator for the first time.</p>

<p><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccinations given will also be recorded on <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> as for other childhood vaccinations. This will support the collection of Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly (<abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr>) data providing a more robust national data set and contribute to improvements in the programme overall.</p>

<h3>SNOMED codes</h3>
<p>The recommended <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.snomed.org/" rel="external">SNOMED codes for recording receipt of <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr></a> in electronic patient records (<abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr>/<abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>) are available online.</p>

<p><abbr title="NHS England and NHS Improvement">NHSEI</abbr> are responsible for the commissioning of <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> and the NHS neonatal <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> immunisation programme. Parents and caregivers of eligible babies born on or after 1 September 2021 will be offered a vaccination appointment by a healthcare professional.</p>

<p>Neonatal <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> providers will inform <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> and the baby’s <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> following vaccination. General Practice must update their clinical records as appropriate. See the <a class="govuk-link" href="#dataflows"><abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccination data flows and patient care pathway</a> for further information.</p>

<abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr> programme vaccine coverage data collection</h2>
<p>Cover of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly (<abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr>) programme is responsible for the data collection in England of Local Authority (<abbr title="Local Authority">LA</abbr>) and <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> level immunisation coverage data from Child Health Information Systems (<abbr title="Childhood Information Systems">CHISs</abbr>) for children aged one, 2 and 5 years of age.</p>

<p>Collection of coverage of <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine evaluated at 12 months has been attempted at a national level, but the data on the eligible population (that is, denominator) has been inadequate in the past. The information to enable this will be available going forward from 1 September 2021.</p>

<p>A new Information Standard for <abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr> will be submitted to the Data Standards Assurance Service (<abbr title="Data Standards Assurance Service">DSAS</abbr>) for appraisal and then submitted to the Data Alliance Partnership Board (<abbr title="Data Alliance Partnership Board">DAPB</abbr>) for approval. There will be at least 6 months between the publication of a revised Information Standard and the first data submissions using the new standard.</p>

<p>In order to allow timely monitoring of <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> programme delivery, the new Information Standard will require <abbr title="Bacillus Calmette–Guérin">BCG</abbr> vaccine coverage to be evaluated in babies at 3 months of age in addition to the current evaluation at 12 months.</p>

<p>Specifications for the revised collection of vaccine coverage data through <abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr> will be available on the NHS Digital <abbr title="Coverage of Vaccination Evaluated Rapidly">COVER</abbr> Information Standard page.</p>

<h3>Key points about the impact of the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> evaluation on rotavirus vaccination</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to babies born on or after 1 September 2021, who will attend for their routine 8 week immunisation appointment from 27 October 2021.</p>

<p>Rotavirus (Rotarix®) vaccine is a live oral vaccine routinely given at 8 and 12 weeks of age as part of the infant immunisation schedule. All live vaccines, including Rotarix®, are contraindicated in babies who receive a <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> diagnosis.</p>

<p>In the areas participating in the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> evaluation, <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening will form part of the routine newborn screening test at 5 days, with most results expected within 10 to 12 days. All babies should have a result available by 28 days, including those in non screening areas where they will be assigned a ‘<abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening not offered’ result.</p>

<p>Childhood Information Systems (<abbr title="Childhood Information Systems">CHISs</abbr>) will receive <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcomes (as part of newborn blood spot results), and will inform practices when available and ahead of the 8 week immunisation appointment.</p>

<p>Practices should update their protocols to ensure that where <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> results (including <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening not offered) have been received by the practice, they are available in the patient record for the practice nurse at the 8 week immunisation appointment.</p>

<p>Parents and <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practices will receive a direct communication from the immunology team to alert them that a child has a suspected or confirmed <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> diagnosis and this will include information on which vaccines should not be given.</p>

<p>Immunisers should make reasonable efforts to ascertain the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening outcome before administering rotavirus vaccine. This would involve checking for a record in the Red Book, the <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> record, screening outcome information sent by <abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr>, or with the parent or caregiver. In the absence of an abnormal <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening result, or if no result can be found, rotavirus vaccination can go ahead. UKHSA have developed an algorithm to assist immunisers with this check on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rotavirus-vaccination-progarmme-for-infants">UKHSA rotavirus programme collection</a> webpage. It is advised that practices include this algorithm in their local protocols.</p>

<p>In areas where <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening will not be offered routinely, immunisers need to be aware that there may be movers-in who have been tested and have a result available from another area.</p>

<p>It is important to use all opportunities to remind parents and caregivers to bring the Red Book and the letter with the outcome of newborn bloodspot screening when they are invited for their routine 8 week immunisation appointment. This could include an explicit mention in the invitation letter (<abbr title="Childhood Information System">CHIS</abbr> or <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr>) and text message reminders.</p>

<p>To ensure consistency and safety for all babies across the country, it is necessary for immunisation providers to adopt this guidance nationally, and regardless of whether the <abbr title="general practitioner">GP</abbr> practice is located in an area participating in the <abbr title="Severe Combined Immunodeficiency">SCID</abbr> screening evaluation.</p>
