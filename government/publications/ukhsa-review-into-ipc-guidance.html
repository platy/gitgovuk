<p>These initial recommendations include 3 interventions which relate to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a reduction of physical distancing from 2 metres to 1 metre with appropriate mitigations where patient access can be controlled</li>
  <li>removing the need for a negative <abbr title="polymerase chain reaction">PCR</abbr> and 3 days self-isolation before selected elective procedures as currently advised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)</li>
  <li>re-adopting standard rather than enhanced cleaning procedures</li>
</ul>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has recommended 3 pragmatic changes that hospitals can make to the current management of coronavirus (COVID-19) infection prevention and control (<abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr>) measures with a focus on elective care as more of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19 and we understand more about how the infection transmits and can be contained.</p>

<p>This advice should be used by acute care providers providers to help them start to make safe changes to their services, in line with a local risk assessment. It is hoped that these recommendations will help to ease some of the pressure created by the pandemic and enhanced <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> measures on NHS capacity over the next few months.</p>

<p>These initial recommendations, to be implemented in low risk areas such as planned or scheduled elective care, relate to physical distancing, testing for COVID-19 prior to planned procedures and environmental cleaning. Local providers are best placed to decide where services can be reinstated in terms of facilities and, patient and staff groups, which will be based upon factors such as the configuration of wards or departments, local capacity and the ability to ventilate spaces. This is a first step towards freeing up capacity in the NHS and Social Care in low risk areas.</p>

<p>Staff working in areas where COVID-19 control measures are amended should be fully vaccinated, asymptomatic and not a contact of a positive case. Staff will be required to continue to comply with the current guidance on asymptomatic testing. Rigorous adherence to routine <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> precautions by all staff remains critical for patient safety and must continue to be implemented.</p>

<p>These practical and pragmatic changes to current ways of working have been recommended based on existing evidence reviews and broad consensus from the <abbr title="infection prevention and control">IPC</abbr> community.</p>
