<p>The Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) commissioned Atkins and Jacobs Joint Venture (<abbr title="Atkins and Jacobs Joint Venture">AJJV</abbr>) to carry out a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-major-schemes-meta-evaluation-2011-to-2016">meta evaluation of local major schemes funded between 2011 and 2016</a>. We welcome the findings of their report.</p>

<p>Evaluation is key to understanding how well national and local government are delivering services and investing in public finances.</p>

<p>It is essential for demonstrating that funds invested by government have provided value for money for the taxpayer while also ensuring transparent and accountable decision-making.</p>

<p>Learning about which schemes are the most effective in achieving their objectives and responding to local transport issues will build the evidence base to support future decision-making and to share lessons about delivery and best practice.</p>

<p>As well as informing decisions about the funding and design of future transport schemes, the findings from this meta evaluation will inform consideration of how evaluation guidance for local authorities could be strengthened.</p>

<p>This could help to clarify <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s expectations with regards to evaluation and reporting standards and provide further support to scheme promotors to produce high-quality monitoring and evaluation outputs.</p>

<p>In parallel to this meta evaluation, <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> has also commissioned <abbr title="Atkins and Jacobs Joint Venture">AJJV</abbr> to carry out a review of the metrics included in the 2012 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monitoring-and-evaluation-framework-for-local-authority-major-schemes">Local authority major schemes: monitoring and evaluation (<abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr>) framework</a> and to assess the degree to which these are still appropriate within the wider context of changes to government policy and updates to key analytical guidance (such as <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-analysis-guidance-tag">Transport analysis guidance</a> (<abbr title="transport analysis guidance">TAG</abbr>) and Her Majesty’s Treasury’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-magenta-book">Magenta book</a>.</p>

<p><abbr title="Atkins and Jacobs Joint Venture">AJJV</abbr>’s review entails in-depth stakeholder engagement involving scheme promotors, consultants who carry out evaluations on their behalf and other relevant evaluation practitioners. This work will also inform consideration of the options for providing further <abbr title="monitoring and evaluation">M&amp;E</abbr> guidance and support to scheme promotors.</p>
