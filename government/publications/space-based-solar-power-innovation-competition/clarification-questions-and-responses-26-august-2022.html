<h3>Is the purpose of Lot 4 to do a Phase A study on a space-based solar power system concept, or on a specific demonstrator mission?</h3>

<p>Lot 4 is to do a Phase A study on a specific demonstrator mission, so please include the enabling systems segments (as depicted in Figure 1 of the <abbr title="Space Based Solar Power">SBSP</abbr> competition guidance document).</p>

<h3>Can an organisation lead on more than one lot?</h3>

<p>An applicant can only lead one application in any given lot, but can lead more than one project if the projects are in different lots. The applicant can be a partner in multiple applications, in the same or different lots.</p>

<h3>Can the <abbr title="Space Based Solar Power">SBSP</abbr> grant be used to fund post-doctoral research staff and equipment? Is there any limit on equipment costs?</h3>

<p>Post-docs are the usual way that Universities resource innovation and we would be happy they are used to develop solutions here. As indicated in the Guidance document (Section 4.5), the <abbr title="Space Based Solar Power">SBSP</abbr> grant can be used to fund proposals involving research organisations including universities. University costs may include post-doctoral research staff and equipment, but as with other government bodies funding higher education institutions, we will not pay more than 80% of the Full Economic Costs (<abbr title="Full Economic Costs">FEC</abbr>) calculated using the Transparent Approach to Costing (<abbr title="Transparent Approach to Costing">TRAC</abbr>). Equipment costs are limited by the limits placed on the maximum grant available per project of £1 million for Lots 1 and 2 or £0.5 million for Lots 3 and 4 Part 1.</p>

<h3>Would the development of a novel power conversion device that sits behind a solar concentrator/cell be in scope for any of the technology area lots if it offered efficiency gains?</h3>

<p>Development of an innovative power conversion device that offers efficiency gains could be in scope if you can quantify the benefits in an <abbr title="Space Based Solar Power">SBSP</abbr> system. The <abbr title="Space Based Solar Power">SBSP</abbr> technology lots are Lot 1 (wireless power transmission) and Lot 2 (high concentration solar <abbr title="Photovoltaics">PV</abbr>) and which it would best fit into would depend on the type of power conversion and the scale of benefits for that technology.</p>
