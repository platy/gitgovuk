<p>The Homes for Ukraine scheme is open for applications. Ukrainians with a named eligible sponsor in the UK, who can provide accommodation, may apply for a visa. It is free to apply. There is no immigration health surcharge and no biometric enrolment fee.
<br><br>
Sponsors can live anywhere in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) and can be of any nationality, provided they have at least six months’ permission to stay in the UK.</p>
</div>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>This scheme is open to Ukrainian nationals who were resident in Ukraine prior to 1 January 2022. It is also open to the immediate family members of such Ukrainian nationals (for example: a spouse, a civil partner, an unmarried partner (must have lived together in a relationship for two years), children under-18, parent if you are under-18, fiancé(e) or a proposed civil partner. These individuals may be of other nationalities).</p>

<p>Applicants can apply from Ukraine or a third country but not from inside the UK. People arriving under this scheme will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live and work in the UK for up to three years; and</li>
  <li>Access healthcare, public funds, employment and other support.</li>
</ul>

<p>One application is required on behalf of every individual coming to the UK.</p>

<p>The application can be completed by either the sponsor in the UK or the Ukrainian/family member, but information from both is required to complete the form.</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>

<p>To apply please visit: <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-visa-under-the-ukraine-sponsorship-scheme">Apply for a visa under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine)</a></p>

<p>The process for a Ukrainian national applying is:</p>

<p>1. You and your sponsor find each other and agree to a match. You may have a friend or acquaintance in the UK who can sponsor you. If you do not currently know anyone in the UK, we understand that charities, faith groups and community organisations are assisting with making connections between individuals.</p>

<p>2. If you have any special requirements, you should check with your sponsor before applying. For example, if you have a young child, are elderly, or have a disability.</p>

<p>3. Either you or your sponsor in the UK fills out the single visa application form online using both parties’ details.</p>

<p>4. Passport numbers (alongside completion of eligibility questions and other personal details) for both you and your sponsor will be required to complete the application.</p>

<p>5. <strong>If you have a valid Ukrainian international passport</strong> you will need to upload a copy of the photograph page of your Ukrainian international passport.</p>

<p>6. <strong>If you (or anyone you are traveling with, including children) do not possess a valid passport</strong>, you will need to book and attend an appointment at a visa application centre to process your application, and record your biometrics. Following your appointment, you should wait for your visa to be issued by UK Visas &amp; Immigration before travelling to the UK.</p>

<p>7. After the application is submitted, checks are done on the sponsor, all other adults in the sponsor’s household, and on you (the applicant).</p>

<p>8. Once both you and your sponsor have passed the checks, UK Visas &amp; Immigration will issue you with a letter confirming you can travel. This letter allows you to board a plane or other form of transportation to the UK.</p>

<h2>Preparing to travel</h2>

<p>You should co-ordinate your arrival with your sponsor and ask them for instructions on how to reach their accommodation from your chosen point of arrival in the UK. At major transport hubs there will be areas where you can get more information if required, for onward travel.</p>

<p>You will be eligible for a single onward journey via national rail, light rail, bus and coach free of charge to your final destination in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales).</p>

<p>Information on this, including a journey planner is available on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/" rel="external">National Rail Enquiries website</a>.</p>

<p>On arrival in the UK, if you did not attend a visa application centre (i.e. you applied entirely online), you will present your permission letter to UK Immigration who will endorse your passport with a six-month entry stamp that confirms your right to work, study and claim benefits in the UK.</p>

<p>Once you are in the UK, you will be able to extend your stay (for up to 3 years) and be issued with a biometric residence permit (BRP). If you have attended a visa application centre and given your biometrics already, you will be given 3 years’ leave to enter on arrival.</p>

<h2>After arrival</h2>

<p>Once in the UK, the Local Authority (council) where you are based will provide you with additional support when it is required.</p>

<p>Your sponsor and other organisations should also be able to offer support on adapting to life in the UK. This can include finding work, access to benefits and services, such as registering with a GP (doctor) and finding school places for children.</p>
