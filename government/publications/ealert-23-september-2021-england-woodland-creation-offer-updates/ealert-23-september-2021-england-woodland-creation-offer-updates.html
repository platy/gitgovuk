<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Amendments to Environmental Stewardship Agreements in order to apply to the England Woodland Creation Offer</h2>

<p>Following collective work by Defra, the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>), Natural England and the Forestry Commission, land managers can now transfer land from an Environmental Stewardship (<abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr>) agreement into the England Woodland Creation offer (<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>) without the recovery of <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> payments, subject to certain conditions.</p>

<p>The conditions are:</p>

<p>a. the transfer of land into <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> will result in a net improvement in environmental management on that land, compared to management under the existing <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement</p>

<p>b. the <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement remains viable after transfer of the land and removal from the <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>How will it work?</h3>
<p>When we receive a <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> application for land in an <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement we will arrange for the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to assess whether these conditions are met. The <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> will make this assessment with advice from Natural England.</p>

<p>Where the conditions are met, we will process the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> application and the applicant will need to apply to the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to amend the <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement (to remove affected parcels). The <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> amendment will not be finalised until the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> application has been processed.</p>

<p>Where the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> application is successful, we will offer a <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Agreement in Principle. The applicant will then need to instruct the <abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr> to complete the amendment to allow the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> agreement to go live.</p>

<p>If you now wish to apply for <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> on land in an <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement please submit a <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> application, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/england-woodland-creation-offer-application-form" class="govuk-link">completing the forms and following the online guidance</a>.</p>

<p>We will be contacting those customers directly impacted by this change.</p>

<p>For enquiries relating to <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> or the process outlined above, please contact  <a href="mailto:EWCOenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">EWCOenquiries@forestrycommission.gov.uk</a>. For enquiries relating to conditions (a) and (b), or the process of removing land from an <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk">ruralpayments@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Updates to the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Grant Manual</h2>
<p>Version 2.0 of the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Grant Manual is now available <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/england-woodland-creation-offer-application-form">on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Grant Manual has been updated to include the following:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span>Updated <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> layer names in Land Information Search (<abbr title="Land Information Search">LIS</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Spatial targeting layers for <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> now contain the â<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>â prefix in the <abbr title="Land Information Search">LIS</abbr> to make it easier for applicants to select the relevant layers (e.g., â<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> Biodiversity â Priority Habitat Networkâ).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span>Chartered accountant statements for agreements where capital item costs exceed Â£50,000</h3>
<p>Statements from accountants confirming applicants have the funds to complete capital works must be dated within the last three months.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span>Planting trees on existing woodland</h3>
<p><abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> will not pay for planting trees on land which is considered an existing woodland.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span>Untrialled species</h3>
<p>Untrialled species have been redefined as âspecies whose performance, potential for invasiveness and susceptibility to known plant health issues when grown in England is currently not provenâ. These species will be permitted at the discretion of the Forestry Commission.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span>Requirements for integral woodland open space</h3>
<p>Agreement from your Woodland Officer will be required for discrete areas exceeding 0.5 ha of non-linear open space.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span>
<abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> and Environmental Stewardship</h3>
<p>Land managers can now transfer land from an <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> agreement into the <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> without the recovery of <abbr title="Environmental Stewardship">ES</abbr> payments, subject to certain conditions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>England Woodland Creation Offer - using the Land Information Search tool</h2>

<p>Guidance on using the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-the-land-information-search">Land Information Search</a> to check if you are eligible for Additional Contributions under <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr>.</p>

<p>As part of ongoing work to improve the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-the-land-information-search">Land Information Search</a> the names of the spatial layers you need to check to see if you are eligible for the Additional Contributions in <abbr title="England Woodland Creation Offer">EWCO</abbr> have been revised.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Woodland Carbon Guarantee fourth auction results</h2>

<p>The fourth auction for the Woodland Carbon Guarantee closed on 01 August 2021.</p>

<p>A total of 23 projects were entered into the fourth auction which was a competitive process with a good range of successful participants. In total, 19 contracts have been offered by the Forestry Commission covering 331 hectares, of which 111 hectares are predominantly native woodland.</p>

<p>The fourth auction encouraged a range of bids for different woodland types. The average price paid for Woodland Carbon Units in the fourth auction was Â£20.32. However, this should not be taken as a firm indicator of acceptable bids in future auctions. Applicants should be aware that the auction process is competitive and lower bids are more likely to be successful.</p>

<p>The date of the next auction in 2022 will be published in due course, <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.gov.uk/guidance/woodland-carbon-guarantee">further information about the guarantee can be found online</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Tree Production Innovation Fund application success</h2>
<p>We are delighted to report the recent success of the Tree Production Innovation Fund application window. We received 31 applications in total.</p>

<p>Applicants will be notified of their funding decision by 23:59 on 28 September 2021.</p>

<span class="number">6. </span>Help shape our future approach to protect plants from pests and diseases</h2>

<p><a rel="external" class="govuk-link" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/gb-plant-biosecurity-strategy/a-plant-biosecurity-strategy-for-great-britain/">A new consultation</a> has launched to inform the new Plant Biosecurity Strategy that will protect the nationâs plants from harmful pests and diseases.</p>

<p>Keen gardeners, nursery owners, farmers, landowners and environmental groups can all take part in the 10-week consultation.</p>

<p>Great Britain already has some of the most robust biosecurity measures in the world but our approach is kept under constant review to ensure these standards are maintained and plants are protected as we face emerging challenges.</p>

<p>The consultation sets out a new vision for plant health and potential measures to strengthen the existing biosecurity regime. <a rel="external" href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/gb-plant-biosecurity-strategy/a-plant-biosecurity-strategy-for-great-britain/" class="govuk-link">The consultation</a> closes on 30 November 2021.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Changes to felling licence applications</h2>
<p>Felling licence application process will be simplified when swift action is required to prevent the spread of pests or diseases and protect public safety.</p>

<p>A limited number of felling licence applications directly related to the management of tree pests and diseases may be exempt from being included on the Public Consultation Register before the trees are felled.</p>

<p>The change will come into effect from 22 October 2021 and will be applied to very specific situations, for example to prevent the spread of quarantine pests or diseases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/forestry-commission-simplify-felling-licence-applications-to-protect-trees-and-people" class="govuk-link">You can read more about the changes online</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Forestry England woodland creation scheme moves to year-round applications</h2>

<p>The Forestry England Woodland Partnership is moving to a year-round scheme with applications now welcome at any time.</p>

<p>The scheme offers long-term rental income to farmers, landowners and public bodies in return for a minimum 50-hectare lease.</p>

<p>It also gives applicants the chance to diversify their farming or landowning businesses and receive guaranteed, regular payments by leasing areas of land for Forestry England to create and manage new woodland.</p>

<p>Further information on the Forestry England Woodland Partnership and how to apply is on <a href="http://forestryengland.uk/woodland-creation" rel="external" class="govuk-link">Forestry Englandâs website</a>.</p>
