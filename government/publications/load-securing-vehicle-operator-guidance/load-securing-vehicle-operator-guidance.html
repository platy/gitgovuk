<h3>Foreword by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>)</h3>

<p>Welcome to our operator guide on load securing.</p>

<p>The securing of a load must be of primary concern for all road users, whether using a seatbelt to secure our loved ones in the family car, or transporting groceries in lorries to the local supermarket.</p>

<p>Not only does effective load securing prevent goods from falling onto roads causing danger to other road users, it also saves money by ensuring that goods arrive at their destination undamaged.</p>

<p>This guide sets out to complement existing Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) guidance and the European Commission (<abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr>) code of practice, providing operators from different sectors of industry with useful information on how <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> and other regulators expect loads to be secured when in transit.</p>

<p>It also provides useful links to other industry specific guidance and a section explaining what your responsibilities are in relation to load securing aimed at operators, consignors and drivers.</p>

<p>This guide was compiled with the assistance of industry experts and other key stakeholders and should be viewed as part of the suite of <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> publications dedicated to giving useful information to operators, drivers and other parties involved in the carriage of goods by road.</p>

<p>Gareth Llewellyn<br>
<abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> Chief Executive</p>

<h3>Foreword by the Traffic Commissioners for Great Britain</h3>

<p>I am pleased to be able to introduce this new <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> guide to load securing, which plays a vital role in keeping our roads safe.</p>

<p>The operation of all commercial vehicles carries some element of risk and operator licensing is designed to reduce this as much as possible.</p>

<p>Taking steps to address the risks associated with load securing is a critical component of your responsibilities, whether as a licence holder, transport manager or driver.</p>

<p>Health and Safety Executive (<abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>) statistics show that workplace transport is one of the highest risk activities.</p>

<p>This load securing guide sets out the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr>âs approach and how to deal with certain types of load, including industry specific guidance for a wide range of sectors.</p>

<p>Please use this guide to check and if necessary improve your current procedures and educate your staff and manage the risks that can arise if a load is not secured properly.</p>

<p>Beverley Bell<br>
Senior Traffic Commissioner</p>

<h3>Foreword by the Freight Transport Association (<abbr title="Freight Transport Association">FTA</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="Freight Transport Association">FTA</abbr> has welcomed the opportunity to assist in the development of this <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> load securing guidance which will assist operators in the transport and supply chain industry in understanding some of the methods of securing loads, and to improve compliance with load securing standards.</p>

<p>The guidance is primarily aimed at general haulage operators and contains some good practical advice for <abbr title="Freight Transport Association">FTA</abbr> members which provides them with information regarding securing loads in curtain side vehicles used on pallet and general haulage type operations which is welcomed.</p>

<h3>Foreword by the Road Haulage Association (<abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr>)</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr> were pleased to be associated with input in producing this guidance, which it is hoped operators will find easy to use and understand with a resulting improvement in secure and safer loads across industry.â¨â¨</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span> Why load securing is important</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> is responsible for lorry, bus and coach enforcement including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>roadworthiness - including both the vehicle and the load itâs carrying</li>
  <li>traffic enforcement - including driversâ hours and overloading</li>
</ul>

<p>During 2013, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> issued over 2,000 prohibitions to vehicles which presented a road safety risk because of how their load was secured.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="22,000 road impact incidents" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/34825/22000-road-impact-incidents.jpg"></div></figure>

<p>In the same period, the Highways Agency reported over 22,000 road impact incidents caused by objects falling from vehicles. This is dangerous to all road users.</p>

<p>This resulted in the closure of either a single lane or the full carriageway. On average, it takes 20 minutes to deal with each incident.</p>

<p>This places a significant financial burden on the UK economy from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>time wasted in traffic</li>
  <li>damage to goods</li>
  <li>damage to infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2 </span> About this guidance</h3>

<p>This guidance has been produced by <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> and representatives from the transport industry. The subject matters chosen were the areas causing the greatest industry concern.</p>

<p>This document does not replace the more extensive guidance available in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-of-loads-on-vehicles-code-of-practice"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>âs code of practice</a></li>
  <li>the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/30c7c1dc-f26e-44af-bd4c-2434b43edd7e" rel="external">European best practices guidelines on cargo securing for road transport</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These more comprehensive documents underpin the current approach to enforcement and should be familiar to anybody involved in the movement of goods via the road network.</p>

<p>For the benefit of this guidance any reference to a vehicle should be read as any vehicle, trailer or combination unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.3 </span> Load securing systems</h3>
<p>The load securing systems you use should be appropriate for both:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the loads being carried</li>
  <li>the vehicles being used</li>
</ul>

<p>These may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âover-the-topâ lashings</li>
  <li>rear kites</li>
  <li>intermediate bulk heads</li>
  <li>direct lashing to specific anchor points</li>
</ul>

<p>Whoever is responsible for loading a vehicle needs to consider other important factors like axle weights and vehicle stability. These are the fundamental requirements in making sure vehicles are safe before starting a journey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.1 </span> Good practice</h3>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXVQxn24kiw" rel="external">Load securing: good practice</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.2 </span> Make sure the vehicle is fit for purpose</h3>
<p>You should consider the types of loads being carried when buying vehicles.</p>

<p>There are aftermarket products which can provide bespoke securing products to adapt vehicles to ensure theyâre fit for purpose.</p>

<p>There are also specialist companies who can give advice on the right load securing system for your operation and the loads you carry. The relevant trade body for your business may be able to help their members.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.3 </span> Load the vehicle properly</h3>

<p>Stack the load against the headboard with the centre of gravity as low as possible. Make sure itâs stable without lashings to reduce the risk of it falling over during unloading.</p>

<p>If the load is not stable by itself, think about how you can support it: put it in a box, stillage or transport frame.</p>

<p>If the load is not against the headboard - or items could slide over it - think about other ways you can stop the load from moving forward. You may need extra lashings, sails, chocks or blocking.</p>

<p>The headboard is a key part of the load securing system - fix any damage as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4 </span> Choose the right securing method</h3>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Whatever method you choose, the load restraint system needs to secure the load to the vehicle chassis and prevent movement.</p>
</div>

<p>Not all loads or vehicles are the same. Choose a securing system that stops the load moving without creating other risks - like unnecessary manual handling and working at height.</p>

<p>Webbing straps or chains are often used to secure loads, but they are not right for every situation. For example fragile or live loads need different securing methods to prevent damage.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.5 </span> Use adequate load restraint</h3>
<p>Incidents happen when drivers and operators underestimate how much restraint is needed to keep a load on the vehicle.</p>

<p>Dynamic forces are much higher than static forces. For example, more force is required to secure a load when it is moving (dynamic) than when it is stationary (static).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.6 </span> Communication is important</h3>

<p>Fatal and serious injuries do not usually âjust happenâ. Generally,  there are some minor incidents and near misses beforehand.</p>

<p>Reporting these and other issues - such as restricted access to delivery sites - can help prevent a more serious situation in the future.</p>

<p>Give drivers clear information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the loads they carry</li>
  <li>how to unload</li>
  <li>what they should do if the load shifts</li>
</ul>

<p>This is particularly important if the driver has not loaded their vehicle or trailer.  Itâs useful for everyone involved if a loading plan is provided.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.7 </span> Load restraint system</h3>
<p>The combined strength of the load restraint system must be sufficient to withstand a forwards force not less than the total weight of the load to prevent the load moving under severe braking, and half the weight of the load moving backwards and sideways.</p>

<p>Even at low speeds, the forces acting on a load when the vehicle is moving can be high enough for the load to move.</p>

<p>Heavy loads can and do move and the weight of the load alone should never be relied on to hold the load in place.</p>

<p>Once moving, forces to prevent the load from continuing to move are much higher than if the load was static.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span> General responsibilities</h3>

<p>The driver is not the only person responsible for the safety of the vehicle and its load.</p>

<p>Everybody in the transport chain should make themselves aware of the rules set out in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-of-loads-on-vehicles-code-of-practice"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> code of practice: safety of loads on vehicles</a>.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoVXOJXbMe4" rel="external">Load securing: roles and responsibilities</a></p>

<h4>Stay up to date</h4>
<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> regularly updates its <a class="govuk-link" href="https://movingon.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external">âMoving Onâ</a> blog which gives official advice and information for lorry, bus and van operators and drivers. You can also sign up to get email alerts when new posts are published.</p>

<p>The trade associations also provide regular updates.</p>

<h4>Health and safety</h4>
<p>Employers have specific responsibilities under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and The Management of Health &amp; Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure the health and safety of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>their employees</li>
  <li>anyone else affected by their work activities</li>
</ul>

<h4>Risk assessment</h4>
<p>Risk assessment is a legal requirement that helps you to identify issues and take reasonably practicable steps to control the risks.</p>

<p>This should help reduce the chances of problems occurring, but you should think about what happens if the load shifts in transit.</p>

<p>Drivers should not be expected to deal with an unsafe load alone at the roadside.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Responsibility for loading vehicles</h3>

<p>If youâre responsible for loading vehicles, you should make sure that theyâre loaded so the load remains in a safe condition during:</p>

<ul>
  <li>loading</li>
  <li>transit</li>
  <li>unloading</li>
</ul>

<p>You should decide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who will carry out the loading</li>
  <li>what training they should have</li>
  <li>how they will be supervised</li>
</ul>

<h4>Involve drivers in the loading process if possible</h4>
<p>If the drivers do not load the vehicle ideally they should be given the opportunity to observe the competent person loading the vehicle.</p>

<p>If itâs not appropriate for the drivers to watch the loading then they should be given information about how the load has been secured and/or given the chance to check the load prior to departure.</p>

<p>If a driver is not happy with how the load is secured or how stable it is, you should make sure that the load is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assessed by a competent person</li>
  <li>reloaded or resecured if necessary</li>
</ul>

<h4>Report load shifts</h4>
<p>Drivers should be asked to report load shifts so that you can take action to deal with it safely and stop it happening again.</p>

<p>Loads can move even under normal driving conditions so do not automatically assume the driver is at fault if the load shifts during a journey.</p>

<h4>Appropriate method of load securing</h4>
<p>You, or a competent person appointed by you, should decide on the most appropriate method of load securing for the load and the vehicle.</p>

<p>You should provide safe access (such as working platforms or access ladders) if the chosen method involves drivers or loaders accessing the trailer bed.</p>

<p>Itâs good practice to involve those actually doing the loading in the decision-making process, as they may be able to identify practical solutions.</p>

<h4>Loading plan</h4>
<p>You may find it useful to develop a loading plan for the loads you transport.</p>

<p>Itâs important to communicate with both the haulier and the delivery site when preparing the loading plan so that everyone knows what theyâre responsible for.</p>

<p>You should think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how the load is to be unloaded</li>
  <li>what happens if the load shifts in transit</li>
</ul>

<p>Information about the load should be clearly communicated to the driver. You need to take account of possible driver handovers and language barriers.</p>

<p>A loading docket that travels with the load may help to communicate information to the haulier and the delivery site. This can be as simple as a sketch showing the position of the load and the load securing system.</p>

<p>The driver should be made aware of whatâs expected of them at the delivery site, including things like whether they should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>report to security on arrival</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> Responsibility for unloading vehicles</h3>

<p>Many of the same principles will apply if youâre responsible for unloading vehicles.</p>

<p>You can help drivers and operators by providing clear information about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whatâs expected on your site</li>
  <li>whoâs responsible for what</li>
</ul>

<h4>Vehicles that arrive with a shifted load</h4>
<p>You should think about what happens if a vehicle arrives at your site with a shifted load.</p>

<p>A vehicle in a potentially dangerous condition should not be sent back onto the public highway. It should be moved to a quarantined area where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>its condition can be assessed</li>
  <li>a decision made about how best to unload it</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#responsibility-for-load-securing">Go back to the list of responsibilities</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span> Responsibility for hauling the load</h3>

<p>If youâre responsible for hauling the load, you should make sure that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>youâre using a suitable vehicle for the task</li>
  <li>the vehicle is loaded so that itâs safe for transport on the road</li>
</ul>

<h4>Communicate with suppliers, the delivery site and driver</h4>
<p>You should communicate with both the supplier and the delivery site so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any issues can be identified</li>
  <li>remedial action taken before they become problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Wherever possible, drivers should be involved in the loading process. Their experience may help the loader(s) identify any problems before the vehicle sets out on its journey.</p>

<h4>Secure the load</h4>
<p>The load should be secured to the trailer before the driver takes it out on the road. You should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>agree the method(s) of load restraint with the supplier</li>
  <li>make sure that the vehicle is suitable for the method chosen (like, for restraint bars you need to make sure that the correct type of side rail is fitted)</li>
</ul>

<p>If loads are to be secured using webbing straps and/or chains, you need to make sure that they can be secured either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>directly to the chassis of the trailer</li>
  <li>to rated attachment points</li>
</ul>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Rope hooks are not suitable attachment points. Straps and chains should not be used in the same assembly.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkdTEefDr8o" rel="external">Load securing: the consequences of poor load securing</a></p>

<p>It can have serious consequences for the driver, other road users, and anyone involved with unloading the vehicle.</p>

<p><abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr> statistics show that workplace transport is one of the highest risk work activities, accounting for over half of all death or injury incidents reported to <abbr title="Health and Safety Executive">HSE</abbr>.</p>

<p>Many incidents are a direct result of poor load securing, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>items falling out of any vehicle when the curtain is opened for unloading and hitting someone stood next to the vehicle</li>
  <li>items falling out of a vehicle during unloading, causing someone to jump out of the way and fall</li>
  <li>poorly-secured loads collapsing or falling over during the journey so they have to be unloaded by hand, and someone then slipping over on the load bed or falling from the vehicle</li>
  <li>damage to goods, property or the infrastructure, which will eventually be passed onto the consumer</li>
  <li>damaged roads, which may themselves lead to more wear and tear on vehicles resulting in increased overheads for the operator</li>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span> How <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> assesses how loads are secured</h3>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> deals with load securing under the following laws:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/100/made" rel="external">The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, regulation 100</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/40A" rel="external">The Road Traffic Act 1988, section 40a</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeBg4SABZw" rel="external">Load securing: how <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> enforces the rules</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> examiners ask themselves a series of questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>can any part of the load slide, topple or bounce in any direction?</li>
  <li>is the load causing the vehicle to be unstable or could it affect the handling?</li>
  <li>can any part of the load fall off during transit?</li>
  <li>is the load security equipment in poor condition and/or not appropriate for the load?</li>
  <li>does any part of the load or the way in which it is secured present, or likely to present, an immediate danger to road users during transit?</li>
</ul>

<p>The examiner will take enforcement action if they answer âyesâ to any of these questions.</p>

<h4>Encourage drivers to ask these questions</h4>

<p>You can encourage your drivers to ask the same questions before the start of any journey. This will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help identify potential problems</li>
  <li>make sure load securing remains high on the driversâ agenda</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span> Prohibition and fixed penalty</h3>

<p>When a <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> examiner finds an insecure load they will use the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/categorisation-of-defects">categorisation of vehicle defects</a> to decide what action to take, choosing the defect that best describes why the load is insecure.</p>

<p>When an examiner issues an immediate prohibition, the driver will not be able to move the vehicle until the load securing problem is fixed. If the examiner finds that the driver is responsible for the insecure load they will issue a fixed penalty notice to the driver.</p>

<p>The driver then has 60 minutes to fix the problem. If they cannot do this, then the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immobilisation-of-a-vehicle"><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> immobilisation policy</a> would be followed with a release fee incurred.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> may then contact the operator to discuss why the load was insecure and what you will do to prevent it happening in the future. If <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> are unhappy with your response they can take further action.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span> Penalty points</h3>

<p>Penalty points are not routinely issued, but they can be in certain situations, for example where a vehicle is deemed to be in a dangerous condition due to the condition or suitable purpose, or weight, distribution, packing and adjustment of the load.</p>

<div aria-label="Warning" class="application-notice help-notice" role="note">
<p>This offence carries 3 penalty points and a licence endorsement for the driver. The court may also give the driver an unlimited fine.</p>
</div>

<p>All vehicles with load securing issues are dangerous, but some are a more significant risk than others.</p>

<p>For example, no load securing on a flat-bed vehicle carrying a load of steel would be considered substantially more dangerous than a curtain-side vehicle laden with a few loose bags of clothing.</p>

<p>The vehicle carrying steel could result in a charge of dangerous condition, whereas a less serious offence might result in the driver being given advice or a verbal warning.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.4 </span> Other action</h3>
<p>Depending on how serious the load securing breach is, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> can interview you about the issues found at the roadside. This action could result in either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>legal proceedings against you</li>
  <li>a report to the Traffic Commissioner (<abbr title="Traffic Commissioner">TC</abbr>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Following consideration of any <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> report, the <abbr title="Traffic Commissioner">TC</abbr> may take regulatory action for failure to comply with the undertaking of an operatorâs licence . Disciplinary action could include suspension, curtailment or revocation of your licence.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Traffic Commissioner">TC</abbr> also has the power to take action against a driverâs vocational licence, such as a suspension. Not only will this have an adverse impact on the driver, it might also create additional problems for the operator.</p>

<p>Prohibitions also adversely impact on an <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/operator-compliance-risk-score/overview">operatorâs compliance risk score</a> (OCRS).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span> Curtain-sided bodies and EN 12642 XL rating</h3>

<p>Even with load retaining curtains, a standard curtain-sided vehicle or trailer body will not normally give enough load securing.</p>

<p>The body structure and curtains only provide weather protection for the load. Load and secure goods the same as you would on a flatbed vehicle.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#EN-12642-XL">EN 12642</a> (BS EN 12642 in the UK) is a build standard for vehicle and trailer bodies. It sets out two types that can be built:</p>

<ul>
  <li>standard body types (L)</li>
  <li>reinforced body types (XL)</li>
</ul>

<p>Vehicle and trailer bodies do not have to be built to this standard in the UK but <a class="govuk-link" href="#EN-12642-XL">XL bodies</a> are a useful part of the load securing system.</p>

<h4>Light goods</h4>

<p>You can secure goods or unstacked pallets that weigh less than 400kg per item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>using buckle straps that hang from the roof of the body structure</li>
  <li>with inner curtains - see <a class="govuk-link" href="#light-palletised-goods">light palletised goods</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Treat goods and pallets over 400kg - and stacked pallets if the combined weight of the stack is more than 400kg - as heavy goods.</p>

<h4>Heavy goods</h4>

<p>Secure heavy goods that weigh more than 400kg per item or pallet with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lashing</li>
  <li>load-rated nets</li>
  <li>tarpaulins with integral straps</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever method you use, it must be able to restrain half the weight of the load to the side and rear, and the full weight forward.</p>

<p>This is the minimum standard for normal road driving.</p>

<p>In most cases, the load carried and the body structure used will show the best way to secure the load.</p>

<p>Both the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safety-of-loads-on-vehicles-code-of-practice"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr></a> and <a class="govuk-link" href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/30c7c1dc-f26e-44af-bd4c-2434b43edd7e" rel="external">EU</a> guides provide detailed instructions on how to secure different loads depending on things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>materials</li>
  <li>weight</li>
  <li>friction between the load and the load bed</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests on ordinary trailers show that the weakest point is the frame.</p>

<p>This highlights the limited benefits of attaching stronger curtains to ordinary trailers.</p>

<h4>EN 12642 XL</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="EN12642XL sticker" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/34816/en12642xl-sticker.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>XL rated bodies display stickers in prominent positions.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Trailers and vehicles built to the EN 12642 XL standard can withstand a minimum of 40% of the rated payload to the side - without extra load securing - when following the manufacturerâs guidance.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> accept an EN 12642 XL rated vehicle/trailer keeping 50% of the rated payload to the side without any extra securing, as long as the load fills the entire load area to the front, rear and to within 80mm of the side. This is often called a âpositive fitâ.</p>

<p>Itâs acceptable to fit lateral bulkheads or use packing material to fill any gaps in the load to guarantee positive fit when loading.</p>

<p>Using XL rated vehicles to transport diminishing or part loads is not ideal but itâs still possible as long as the following are met:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>any gaps created by a diminishing load are blocked keeping a positive fit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a partial load which does not fill the load area has extra securing - this should be enough to meet the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> rules: 50% to the side, rear and 100% to the front</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the use of rated lashing straps across the rear of the load must provide security for 50% of the entire load. This will secure the load in the same way as the rear of the vehicle would for a full load.</p>

<p>Or, the load should be secured as it would in a non-âXLâ rated vehicle.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>The EN 12642 XL standard refers to the entire vehicle or trailer and not just the curtains. So, reinforced curtains fitted to an ordinary trailer do not meet the XL standard. Thereâs no such thing as an âXL curtainâ.</p>
</div>

<h4>XL stickers</h4>

<p>XL-rated bodies have stickers in prominent positions - usually on the rear door or front bulkhead - to show they meet the standard.</p>

<p>The curtains of an XL-rated body also have to be built to EN 12641.</p>

<p>Stickers confirming this are usually found on the inside of the curtains at the rear of the body.</p>

<p>XL stickers should provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation that the body structure - not just the curtain sides - meets the EN 12642 XL standard</li>
  <li>the name of the vehicle or trailer manufacturer</li>
  <li>the year of manufacture</li>
</ul>

<h4>XL body test reports or certificates</h4>

<p>XL bodies are covered either by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a test report specific to the vehicle</li>
  <li>another document, such as a certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be able to get these from the organisation that tested the vehicle or trailer to the standard.</p>

<p>The manufacturer will be able to tell you who carried out the test.</p>

<p>You do not have to keep these documents with the vehicle or trailer. But you may find it useful to provide copies to be shown to enforcement authorities at the roadside.</p>

<p>Some vehicles are tested to a higher standard than EN 12642 so that they can carry larger or unusual loads. In these cases, <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> expects you to be able to show the relevant certificate at the roadside.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span> Double-deck trailers</h3>

<p>Double-deck trailers are designed to optimise the available space in trailers. This reduces the carbon footprint and improves efficiency.</p>

<p>These benefits have led to an increase in their use over the last few years.</p>

<h4>Risks assessments and securing solutions</h4>

<p>Working at height can be problematic on any vehicle, however double decks present particular problems.</p>

<p>Operators and consignors (the person sending a shipment) should make sure that a thorough risk assessment has been carried out to identify the most practicable means of loading and securing goods on the vehicle.</p>

<p>Securing solutions are available to help to mitigate the risks of working at height on double deck trailers. For example, netting and strapping systems that attach to the trailer roof and can be pulled into place over the load and secured to the vehicle chassis from ground level allow goods to be secured without accessing the load bed.</p>

<h4>Carrying palletised loads</h4>

<p>Double deck trailers often carry palletised loads. Individual laden pallets are known as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âlight palletsâ if they weigh up to 400kg</li>
  <li>âheavy palletsâ if they weight over 400kg</li>
</ul>

<p>do not use the upper deck for carrying stacked pallets or pallets weighing over 400kg.</p>

<p>Secure heavy pallets and stacked laden light pallets on the lower deck with rave to rave lashing or something similar.</p>

<h4>Load securing on the upper deck</h4>

<p><abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr>, The Pallet Network (<abbr title="The Pallet Network">TPN</abbr>) and the Association of Pallet Networks (<abbr title="Association of Pallet Networks">APN</abbr>) gave <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> an acceptable solution on loading and securing for double-deck trailers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="last-child">Laden pallets on the upper deck of double-deck curtain-siders should be single-stacked; and weigh no more than 400kg each.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><abbr title="Road Haulage Association">RHA</abbr>, <abbr title="The Pallet Network">TPN</abbr>, <abbr title="Association of Pallet Networks">APN</abbr> and enforcement bodies have agreed that the use of an extra internal curtain with integral straps designed to hug the load on the upper deck is a practicable means of mitigating the risks of falling objects during unloading and working at height.</p>

<p>This arrangement can be used by any operator or trailer manufacturer. Itâs recommended particularly for new trailers, but can also be fitted retrospectively.</p>

<p>The benefit of the internal curtain with integral straps is that it contains the pallets more effectively than using internal straps alone. This improves safety both on the road and in the workplace.</p>

<h4>Load securing on the lower deck</h4>

<p>Generally speaking loads carried on the lower deck and swan neck of a double-deck trailer should be secured as if they were carried on a single deck trailer.</p>

<p>Your risk assessment may indicate that for light goods or crushable loads itâs practicable to use hanging straps or internal curtains on the lower deck.</p>

<h4>Other methods of securing</h4>
<p>This guidance is the minimum requirement needed to secure loads on existing double-deck trailers.</p>

<p>You can decide to use other methods of securing the load as well as those in this section, for example rated ratchet straps.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-vehicles">Go back to the list of types of vehicles</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span> Rigid-sided vehicles</h3>

<p>Vehicles with rigid sides are no different to any other vehicle when it comes to load securing. Load securing requirements still apply.</p>

<h4>Gate-type systems</h4>
<p>Most rigid-sided vehicles have a gate-type system. The security of the sides relies on âlockingâ the sides to an anchor stanchion or stanchions fitted to the bed of the trailer.</p>

<p>These items must be kept in good condition. Any defects must be repaired at the earliest opportunity if the load securing relies on the sides of the vehicle.</p>

<h4>Loads above the height of the sides</h4>
<p>Loads stacked above the height of the sides of the vehicles need to be secured to the vehicle by other means - usually by over-the-top lashings. The sides of the vehicle cannot be relied upon to secure this type of loading.</p>

<p>Loads above the height of a vehicles sides can affect stability and will raise the centre of gravity.</p>

<h4>Load shift</h4>
<p>Box vans and rigid-sided vehicles offer some load security, but you need to consider the effect of a load shift on vehicle stability. Goods carried in containers should also be secured to prevent movement during a journey.</p>

<h4>Stop loose items from falling</h4>
<p>Tarpaulins or netting/sheeting should be used on tippers, bulk containers and skips to stop loose items from falling.</p>

<p>Goods should not be loaded over the height of the sides of the vehicle or skip.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-vehicles">Go back to the list of types of vehicles</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span> Euroliner vehicles and trailers</h3>

<p>Euroliner semi-trailers have an internal frame running down their length, usually hidden by standard curtain sides.</p>

<p>Different sized beams (made of aluminium or wood) can be placed in the frame, either lengthways - to strengthen the side - or across the width of the vehicle to separate the load.</p>

<p>The securing of light palletised goods - where each pallet or stack weigh no more than 400kg -  on Euroline vehicles is accepted as sufficient when the these conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the load bed is filled to prevent the contents from moving when in transit</li>
  <li>the load is stacked against the headboard, or with any gap between the front of the load and the headboard packed to prevent it sliding forward</li>
  <li>the gap between the sides of the load and the frame/beams is less than 80 mm (approximately 3 inches)</li>
  <li>if the load does not reach the rear doors, then additional measures are in place to stop backward movement</li>
  <li>the beams and frame are in a serviceable condition, for example there are no cracks or obvious signs of damage, decay or rot</li>
  <li>the beams adequately contain the load so that there is no risk of items falling from the trailer when the curtains are pulled back - for example the load cannot escape  under, through or over the beams</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional securing will be needed if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the vehicle is used to carry palletised or stacked loads which are more than 400kg</li>
  <li>the goods do not fill the load area - to prevent uncontrolled movement of the load under normal driving conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional securing could include rated lashing (heavy duty) straps attached between raves (hooks), or other approved methods.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.1 </span> Overview of vehicle stability</h3>

<p>The transport industry and the loads carried are extremely diverse, so itâs very difficult to provide generic guidance on load securing that covers everything.</p>

<p>Many sectors of the industry have specific problems which require bespoke solutions to follow the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> guidelines.</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> guides</h4>
<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and <abbr title="European Commission">EC</abbr> guides do cover the vast majority of situations that youâre likely to come across. They also include information on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the impact of the coefficient of friction (<abbr title="coefficient of friction">COF</abbr>)</li>
  <li>how different materials move in relation to each other</li>
  <li>the number of straps required to overcome the effect of different <abbr title="coefficient of friction">COF</abbr> values</li>
</ul>

<h4>What vehicle loading affects</h4>
<p>How a vehicle is loaded can significantly affect:</p>

  <li>its handling on the road</li>
  <li>the likelihood of the load moving or becoming unstable during the journey</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâs important to think about load distribution and load stability at the planning stage.</p>

<h4>Centre of gravity</h4>
<p>The centre of gravity of a loaded goods vehicle tends to be much higher than that of a passenger car. This makes a goods vehicle more likely to roll over than a car at the same speed.</p>

<p>Single items with a high centre of gravity (like large plant equipment) should be transported on low loaders to minimise the unbalancing effect.</p>

<h4>Loads that move from side to side</h4>
<p>Loads that are free to move from side to side within a vehicle can result in serious stability issues, even if the load is contained within the vehicle body.</p>

<p>The movement of live loads (like bagged sand or aggregate, hanging clothes or meat) can result in a âpendulumâ effect that quickly leads to vehicle rollover.</p>

<h4>Rollcages</h4>
<p>Rollcages can cause particular problems if they are not secured.</p>

<p>There have been instances where cages have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rolled forward and punched through the headboard</li>
  <li>rolled backwards when the driver opens the rear doors for unloading</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.2 </span> Light palletised goods</h3>

<p>Pallets are widely used to carry all manner of goods, mainly because they are a safe and convenient way to store and move goods around via fork lift trucks.</p>

<p>Individual laden pallets are referred to as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>âlight palletsâ if they weigh up to 400kg</li>
  <li>âheavy palletsâ if they weight over 400kg</li>
</ul>

<p>The goods on the pallets are often shrink-wrapped to restrict movement during transit. However, this wrapping does not provide any load securing.</p>

<p>Palletised loads must be stable and freestanding before any load securing is applied. Make sure goods are shrink-wrapped or banded to the pallet theyâre transported on. Otherwise, they could slide or topple off the pallet in transit or during unloading. Make sure that the unit load remains in a secure and stable condition at all times.</p>

<h4>Transporting light palletised goods in curtained-sided vehicles</h4>

<p>When deciding how to transport light palletised goods in curtain-sided vehicles, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>think carefully about the most appropriate securing method for the load</li>
  <li>carry out a risk assessment that takes account of:
    <ul>
      <li>whether the load can be carried in a different body type</li>
      <li>possible alternate securing methods that do not crush/damage the load</li>
      <li>the risks of working at height when securing the load compared to the likely risks due to the load moving</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You need to secure the load to reduce the risk of harm as far as is reasonably practicable.</p>

<h4>Stacked light palletised goods</h4>
<p>Stacked light palletised goods need to be secured in the same way as palletised goods over 400kg.</p>

<p>The best way is to use over-the-top lashings secured to the vehicle chassis or rave-to-rave.</p>

<p>Securing some products may present additional challenges, particularly if theyâre susceptible to strap damage (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#crushable-loads">crushable loads</a>).</p>

<h4>Light pallets on double-deck trailers</h4>
<p>On double-deck trailers with inner curtains, light pallets should be carried on the top deck with heavier pallets or goods secured on the lower deck using over-the-top lashings.</p>

<h4>Centre of gravity</h4>
<p>Irrespective of the weight of a pallet, you should consider the centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Pallets with a high centre of gravity need extra strapping because of the potential for the load to be unstable, which increases the likelihood of movement during transit.</p>

<h4>Loose  items</h4>
<p>Loose items (such as single pallets, pump trucks or chains) on flat beds need to be secured by other methods, as the internal strapping system or curtains will have no effect.</p>

<h4>âLoad huggingâ curtains</h4>
<p>Inner curtains tapered at the roof of the trailer are known as âload huggingâ curtains. These are used by some industries to secure the loads carried.</p>

<p>There will also be an outer curtain on these vehicles for weather protection as the inner curtains are constructed of nets and securing straps.</p>

<p>These vehicles and trailers are commonly found in the drinks industry and are covered extensively in the <abbr title="Freight Transport Association">FTA</abbr> guidance document (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#drinks-industry">the drinks industry</a>).</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.3 </span> Roll cages</h3>
<p>Roll cages are frequently used to carry goods in all types of vehicles. These are becoming increasingly popular because they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make it easier to move goods around</li>
  <li>offer an element of security above that provided by pallets</li>
</ul>

<p>Once loaded onto the vehicle they need securing to stop them from moving. This is often done using securing bars, lashings or other suitable methods.</p>

<p>Insecure roll cages can move around freely inside a vehicle load area. This can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have a significant impact on the vehicleâs stability</li>
  <li>damage the goods</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a particular problem with partially loaded vehicles (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#multi-drop-or-collection-diminishing-loads">diminishing loads</a>) and presents further problems when unloading. You should take appropriate steps to stop movement of the roll cages to the side, front and particularly to rear.</p>

<p>To prevent goods being damaged care should be taken to stack products within the footprint of the cage. Damaging the goods can lead to the loads becoming loose and causing further problems when off loading.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.4 </span> Crushable loads</h3>

<p>Goods that could be damaged by rave-to-rave over-the-top lashings can be protected by using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>corner boards</li>
  <li>edge protectors</li>
  <li>wide strapping systems</li>
</ul>

<p>These spread the load to allow the load to be secured to the vehicle bed.</p>

<p>Crushable loads could need extra protection (like shrink-wrap or other packaging) to be protected enough to be transported. Netting systems (with straps interwoven through the netting) can be used for these loads.</p>

<p>Other methods or other vehicle types may need to be considered for crushable loads.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.5 </span> Lightweight and fragile loads</h3>

<p>There are some loads which are very unlikely to cause any load securing problems while in transit in curtain side vehicles, for exampe small amounts of polystyrene insulation.</p>

<p>Itâs still important that the load is stopped from moving due to the danger to the person responsible for unloading the vehicle.</p>

<p>You might not be able to use traditional lashings because of the damage they would cause. However, internal straps may retain the load sufficiently dependant on the size of the objects.</p>

<p>You could also use some sort of internal frame or roll cage to provide the necessary securing. Make sure the frame itself is secure if you use this method</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.6 </span> Multi-drop or collection (diminishing loads)</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> code of practice requires 50% of the load to be secured to prevent rearward and sideways movement.</p>

<p>When an entire load is delivered in one drop using the appropriate securing, itâs quite straight forward. However, this becomes more difficult for vehicles involved in multi-drops or carrying diminishing loads.</p>

<p>Multi-site deliveries can cause issues with responsibility for the safety of the load.</p>

<h4>Plan for the diminishing load</h4>
<p>Diminishing loads should be accounted for at the planning stage.</p>

<p>You should develop a clear system of work and communicate it to all parties so thereâs no misunderstanding about what should be done at each delivery.</p>

<h4>Having enough appropriate securing</h4>
<p>Dependant upon the type of vehicle used, parts of the load will either be removed from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the side when using curtain-sided vehicles</li>
  <li>the rear with rigid-sided vehicles</li>
  <li>both from a flat bed</li>
</ul>

<p>So itâs important that the driver has enough appropriate securing with them to be able to fix the problems caused by diminishing loads.</p>

<h4>Load the vehicle correctly</h4>
<p>The whole process can be made much easier if the vehicle is loaded correctly in the first place.</p>

<p>If the load is removed in a hap-hazard way, gaps may appear that could be detrimental to effectiveness of the load securing system. If this happens, the driver might find it easier to use <abbr title="material used to load and secure cargo during transportation">dunnage</abbr> or blocking to fill the gaps, and keep the integrity of the original security.</p>

<h4>Reload the vehicle</h4>
<p>The other way to keep safe would be to reload the vehicle and reapply the chosen securing.</p>

<p>This shows why itâs important to plan properly, load the vehicle correctly and make sure the driver has enough load securing equipment.</p>

<h4>Diminishing load from the rear</h4>
<p>A diminishing load from the rear causes extra problems, as the rear of the trailer will not provide any security once the rearmost part of the load has been removed.</p>

<p>Loads can be secured by cross over straps, kites or sails to comply with the 50% requirement. The strapping needs to be maintained as the load diminishes or an intermediate bulkhead could be used.</p>

<h4>Watch out for overloading</h4>

<p>Drivers should be wary about axle overloads when removing large portions of the load from either the front or the rear. The remaining load may well need re-distribution to avoid these situations.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.7 </span> Bulk loads carried loose</h3>

<p>You should carry loads like wood chippings, pellets and grain in solid-sided vehicles and curtain-sided vehicles specifically adapted for that use. These vehicles have additional strapping and covering to secure the load within the vehicle.</p>

<p>The likelihood of such items becoming insecure is unlikely if carried in a covered secure containing trailer.</p>

<p>Grain carriers and vehicles servicing the wood processing industry will have this type of vehicle. Most will have a blowing system fitted to the vehicle to load and unload the vehicle contents into a storage unit.</p>

<p>Standard curtain-sided trailers should not be used for this kind of load.</p>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.8 </span> Equipment carried on vehicles</h3>

<p>Equipment carried on vehicles (like Hiabs, fork lift trucks and pallet pump trucks) should be properly secured when not in use.</p>

<h4>Lorry-mounted cranes (Hiabs)</h4>
<p>Hiabs should be deactivated and correctly seated and not used as part of the load securing system.</p>

<h4>Pallet pump trucks</h4>
<p>Pallet pump trucks should be secured in the same way as the rest of a vehicles load, for example with lashings or other suitable methods.</p>

<h4>Lorry-mounted fork list truck</h4>
<p>Lorry-mounted fork lift trucks (often called âmoffettsâ) should be secured using the manufactureâs recommended instructions.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Rear-mounted forklift truck" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/38109/moffett-flatbed.jpg"></div>

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="#types-of-loads">Go back to the list of types of loads</a></p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.9 </span> Skips</h3>

<p>Empty or loaded skips can be carried on either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dedicated skip lorries</li>
  <li>flatbed vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâs recommended that skips are carried on skip lorries wherever possible, as it can be very difficult to adequately secure a skip on a flatbed vehicle.</p>

<h4>Loaded or partly-loaded skips</h4>

<p>Loaded or partly-loaded skips should not be stacked on top of each other for transport, even on a dedicated skip lorry.</p>

<p>The lower skip does not provide a stable base and there is a risk of the upper skip/skips moving under sudden braking, or falling from the side of the vehicle under a combined steering and braking manoeuvre (for example, swerving to avoid another road user).</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Skip vehicle" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/38284/skip-vehicle.jpg"></div></figure>

<h4>Lifting arms</h4>
<p>Some skip lorries have a shaft connecting the upper ends of the lifting arms. This is used by some operators to âpress downâ on stacked skips. This is not recommended. Using the lifting arms for load restraint can lead to fatigue, which could lead to cracking in the lifting arms.</p>

<p>Fatigue cracks can grow very slowly and the lifting arms will still operate normally. Eventually the crack will grow to the extent that thereâs no longer enough strength in the arm to hold the weight of a skip, and sudden and unexpected failure of the lifting arm may occur.</p>

<p>The lifting arms of skip lorries should be inspected every 12 months by a competent person in order to comply with the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/loler.htm" rel="external">Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (<abbr title="Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations">LOLER</abbr>).</a></p>

<p>Some types of lifting equipment have a connecting beam between the two hydraulic lifting arms. In certain situations, this beam can be used to secure two loaded skips.</p>

<p>Tests show that when two loaded skips are carried on the vehicle and the hydraulic rams are pushing the bar down onto the top skip, then enough pressure is applied.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> will accept this as providing acceptable security when these  conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>the lifting equipment is in good condition and tested to <abbr title="Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations">LOLER</abbr> regulations</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>thereâs a connecting beam between the two lifting arms and itâs in contact with the top skip at both sides</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the bottom of the top skip is at least 100 millimetres below the top of the bottom skip</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>loose loads are sheeted or covered properly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if skips are carried in a line, then loaded skips are only at the rear of the vehicle where the hydraulic lifting arms and beams secure the load</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you can produce evidence at the roadside that the vehicle has been tested at TRL (Transport Research Laboratory) or a similar facility</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the chains used to lift the skips are attached for extra security</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.10 </span> Flexible intermediate bulk containers (<abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr>)</h3>

<p><abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr>, sacks and other bulk bags can become unstable during transport due to the loads settling. This could put the driver or anyone else unloading the vehicle at risk.</p>

<p>The most appropriate vehicle for this type of load would be a rigid-sided vehicle with securing supplemented by lashings.</p>

<h4>Drop-side vehicles</h4>

<p>When using drop-side vehicles, make sure the tail boards, hinges and any fastening mechanisms are in good condition.</p>

<p>You might also need to consider additional security if the load is higher than the side of the vehicle. Also consider using tarpaulins to prevent any loose loads being blown from the <abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr>.</p>

<h4>Flat bed vehicles</h4>
<p>These loads should be loaded to the headboard if theyâre carried on flat bed vehicles. To stop movement to the side, use lashing straps with edging strips or some other method to disperse the pressure from the strap onto the load.</p>

<p>Tarpaulins rated for load securing with inter woven rated straps can also be used to provide effective security. Due to the nature of the load it is good practice to check for movement during a journey.</p>

<h4>Curtained-sided vehicles</h4>
<p><abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr> carried in curtain-sided vehicle present similar problems and should be secured in the same way.</p>

<p>Other load securing solutions are also available which would be effective for FIBC such as wide straps suspended on bungee cord (see <a class="govuk-link" href="#load-securing-solutions">load securing solutions</a>).</p>

<h4>Open or unsealed <abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr>
</h4>
<p>You may need to put extra sheeting or tarpaulin over the top of the load to stop products from escaping the FIBC if theyâre not sealed or closed.</p>

<h4>Roping and sheeting</h4>
<p>Roping and sheeting, used correctly, and using equipment in good condition, can be an effective way of securing <abbr title="flexible intermediate bulk containers">FIBCs</abbr> to meet the requirements of UK and European standards.</p>

<p><abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> recommends that you use rope and sheets that have been strength tested and rated. This is so you can easily prove that the load is secured to enforcement authorities at the roadside.</p>

<p>The sheet should also fully contain the load, rather than resting on top of it.</p>

<p>Damaged or torn sheets, and frayed or worn ropes, should be replaced or repaired.</p>

<h4>Intermediate bulk containers (IBCs)</h4>

<p>Secure IBCs to the load bed. Use at least one over-the-top lashing from the vehicleâs chassis or rave-to-rave lashing.</p>

<p>Make sure the lashing straps are placed across the strongest point of the frame. This will avoid crushing the frame and potentially damaging the container.</p>

<p>Check the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.chemical.org.uk/publications/" rel="external">Chemical Business Associationâs guidance</a> for more information about securing hazardous goods IBCs.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.11 </span> Vehicle transporters</h3>

<p>You can move vehicles and plant equipment on specialised vehicles like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>car transporters</li>
  <li>flatbed vehicles</li>
  <li>low loaders</li>
</ul>

<h4>Moving cars and light vans up to 3,500kg on car transporters</h4>

<p>Vehicles carried on car transporters should face forward, unless the loading scheme says otherwise.</p>

<p>Their weight should be distributed evenly across the width of the vehicle so the driver has enough space to work safely on either side.</p>

<p>Their centre of gravity should be over the lengthwise centre line of the transporter.</p>

<p>When loading, follow the manufacturerâs recommendations. The parking brake should always be on after a vehicleâs loaded.</p>

<p>Car transporters have a  high centre of gravity compared to many other types of goods vehicles. To reduce the risk of rollover, the heavier vehicles should be on the lower deck.</p>

<p>Use extra securing to prevent movement in transit. Securing is generally achieved through a mixture of blocking/chocking and webbing lashings.</p>

<p>The number of chocks and lashings used depends on the load. But as a general guide, there should be three points of contact between the vehicle and the transporter</p>

<table>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Vehicle on flat deck</td>
      <td>2 wheels secured by lashings, preferably diagonally opposite, plus one chock or lashing on a third wheel of each vehicle</td>

    <tr>
      <td>First and last vehicles on decks</td>
      <td>4 wheels secured by lashings on vehicles loaded at the front and rear</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If itâs impractical to use chocks for some vehicles on a transporter, an extra wheel can be secured with a lashing strap.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Checker plate" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/36686/checker-plate.jpg"></div>
<figcaption><p>Regularly inspect the check plate for wear and tear.</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>Some vehicle manufacturers recommend that each wheel should be attached. You should follow this advice.</p>

<p>Lashings used to secure vehicles should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufactured to the BS EN 12195-2 Standard</li>
  <li>be rated for at least 1,500 daN</li>
  <li>in a serviceable condition without obvious defects that would affect the strength of the lashing</li>
</ul>

<p>Lashings should ideally pass over the wheel lengthways to hold the wheel down to the load bed.</p>

<p>The lashings should be attached to either dedicated attachment points or to dedicated attachment eyes fitted to the transporter or floor attachment points, as long theyâre in a serviceable condition. Ratchets should be closed and locked.</p>

<p>If you use wheel chocks, they should be placed so that they aid load security by securing against:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the braking force on a flat deck</li>
  <li>gravity on an angled deck</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cars and light vans up to 3,500kg transported on flatbed or curtain-sided trailers</h4>

<p>Flatbed trailers do not have a superstructure to stop unintended load movement. Because of this more securing is needed.</p>

<p>Load vehicles as close to the headboard as possible, with the parking brake on.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">How the vehicle is loaded</th>
      <th scope="col">How it needs to be secured</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Vehicle on standard flatbed</td>
      <td>All 4 wheels secured with lashings, with chocks on at least 2 wheels (preferably diagonally opposite)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Vehicle on recovery transporter trailer</td>
      <td>Winch cable attached, plus lashings on at least 2 wheels (preferably diagonally opposite)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If the design of the transporting vehicle makes it difficult to secure the wheels, use extra lashings.</p>

<p>Stacked scrap vehicles should be stable without lashings.</p>

<p>To stop the webbing being damaged by sharp edges, use webbing sleeves or something similar to protect any lashings passing over the stack.</p>

<p>Lashings used to secure vehicles should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manufactured to the BS EN 12195-2 Standard</li>
  <li>rated for at least 1,500 daN</li>
  <li>in good condition without obvious defects that would affect their strength</li>
</ul>

<p>The superstructure and curtains of a standard curtain-sided trailer are not enough to provide load restraint for a vehicle. The vehicle must be secured as if it was being transported on a flatbed trailer.</p>

<p>A trailer constructed to the BS EN 12642-XL standard may provide some containment. But an XL trailer alone is not enough to prevent load movement. The reinforced body structure should be thought of as an extra safety measure rather than part of the load securing system.</p>

<p>Vehicles should be loaded as close to the headboard as possible - with the parking brake on - and chocked and lashed.</p>

<h4>Transporting vehicles over 3,500 kg on car transporters</h4>
<p>Generally, there should be four points of contact between the vehicle and the transporter, consisting of either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 chocks and 2 lashing straps - preferably on diagonally opposing wheels</li>
  <li>one chock and 3 lashing straps</li>
  <li>4 lashing straps, one on each wheel</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transporting vehicles over 3,500 kg on flatbed trailers</h4>

<p>Ideally, vehicles over 3, 500 kg should be moved on low loader trailers so that the centre of gravity is as low as possible.</p>

<p>A high centre of gravity can affect the stability of the transporting vehicle and increase the risk of rollover or loss of control.</p>

<p>There should be four points of contact between the vehicle and the trailer, in the form of lashing straps on each wheel.</p>

<p>Chocks can be used for extra safety but should not be considered part of the load securing system.</p>

<p>Vehicles should be loaded to the headboard with the parking brake on and the vehicle left in gear if possible.</p>

<h4>Heavy goods vehicles</h4>

<p>Ideally, tractor units and trailers should be moved on low loaders so that the centre of gravity is kept as low as possible. This helps to reduce the risk of rollover or loss of control.</p>

<p>Secure vehicles using a lashing system to prevent unintended movement. Chains are preferable.</p>

<p>The parking brake must be on and the wheels chocked or otherwise prevented from movement. For example, by placing the vehicle up against the swan neck.</p>

<p>Vehicles should be lashed using direct lashing. This means, one attached to the vehicle, and the other to the transporting low loader or flatbed.</p>

<p>There should be at least four lashings, secured as part of two opposing pairs. The angle of the straps or chains relative to the load bed should be as close to horizontal as possible.</p>

<p>Extra frictional lashing - up and over the load - using webbing straps can be used to increase the safety of the load.</p>

<p>If the vehicle has attachment points, use these for load securing. Also, attach lashings to rated attachment points on the low loader or flatbed load bed wherever possible.</p>

<p>Lashings should not be attached to sheeting hooks, as these are not strong enough to withstand the required forces.</p>

<p>If more than one trailer is carried by piggy-back, each trailer should be lashed to the trailer itâs carried on, and then to the transporting vehicle.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Carrying a heavy goods vehicle by 'piggyback'" src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/37000/vehicle-carrying-by-piggyback.jpg"></div></figure>

<h4>Plant equipment</h4>
<p>Heavy-wheeled plant should ideally  be moved on low loaders so that the centre of gravity is kept as low as possible. This helps to reduce the risk of rollover or loss of control.</p>

<p>Secure vehicles using a lashing system to prevent unintended movement. Chains are preferable.</p>

<p>There should be at least four lashings, secured as part of two opposing pairs. The angle of the straps or chains relative to the load bed should be as close to horizontal as possible.</p>

<p>Extra frictional lashing - up and over the load - using webbing straps can be used to increase the safety of the load.</p>

<p>If the vehicle has attachment points, use these for load securing. Also, attach lashings to rated attachment points on the low loader or flatbed load bed wherever possible.</p>

<p>Lashings should not be attached to sheeting hooks, as these are not strong enough to withstand the required forces.</p>

<p>Ideally, vehicles should be loaded against the swan neck of a low loader or the headboard of a flatbed.  This creates a physical barrier to movement besides the lashing system.</p>

<p>Chocks or lateral timbers can also help to prevent movement.</p>

<p>Booms, jibs, buckets, grabs and other components should be separately secured to the transporting vehicle with one or more lashing.</p>

<p>do not rely on hydraulic pressure or any other form of stored energy to prevent movement.</p>

<p>Thereâs very specific guidance on securing plant vehicles in the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> code of practice. You should bear in mind the rules contained in the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/100/made" rel="external">Construction and Use Regulations</a> about the maximum dimensions when any equipment is extended to the front or rear of the vehicle.</p>

<h4>Scrap metal</h4>
<p>Scrap metal, including scrap cars, should be transported with care.  Itâs a high-density load and may contain sharp edges that can cut through webbing lashings.</p>

<p>Itâs recommended that you use chain lashings for this type of load.</p>

<p>The friction between the load and the vehicle load bed is likely to be very low so itâs important to use an adequate number of lashings.</p>

  <li>prevent them moving while the vehicle is in motion</li>
  <li>reduce the risk of them falling out of the vehicle during unloading</li>
</ul>

<p>This is very important for kerbside deliveries to smaller premises where pedestrians are at risk of being hit.</p>

<p>Lashing loads to multi-drop kerbside delivery sites may put the driver at more risk. Other restraint methods should be used if possible.</p>

<p>You should transport small and/or breakable items in stillages if no other method can be used.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.13 </span> Scaffolding equipment</h3>

<p>Scaffolding equipment will comprise of poles, boards and ancillary equipment, and is often transported on flatbed vehicles.</p>

<p>Scaffolding equipment should be loaded so that it does not move relative to the vehicle under normal driving conditions. Fold-up sides and a rear gate or sail can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>help to prevent load movement</li>
  <li>allow equipment to be transported without lashings as long as the load is not stacked higher than the sides</li>
</ul>

<p>The load should be placed in contact with the headboard if possible. If a gap is left, an intermediate bulkhead (which can be constructed from scaffold boards), blocking or <abbr title="material used to load and secure cargo during transportation">dunnage</abbr> can be used to prevent movement, or lashings can be used over the load.</p>

<p>Groups of poles should be âbelly wrappedâ and secured to prevent movement during the journey.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.14 </span> Round timber</h3>

<p>Round timber is normally carried on a skeleton type trailers with goal posts. This is allowed as long as the goal posts are in good condition and are secure.</p>

<p>As a minimum, each pair of goal posts should be accompanied by over-the-top lashing, either straps or chains, from chassis to chassis.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">7.15 </span> Steel, machinery and plant</h3>

<p>Chains are used for heavy loads like steel, machinery and plant equipment.</p>

<p>Steel is a high-density, high-risk load. The consequences of load shift can be extremely serious.</p>

<p>Movement of the load endangers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the driver - if the load slides forward during the journey or shifts sideways and causes the driver to lose control of his vehicle</li>
  <li>other road users and pedestrians - if the load shifts sideways or slides backwards and falls off the vehicle</li>
  <li>unloading personnel - if the load has become unstable during the journey and collapses during unloading</li>
</ul>

<p>It is very important to load steel so that they are stable on the vehicle without relying on lashings. This may mean using chocks or blocking to make sure the load is stable.</p>

<div aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice" role="note">
<p>Even though steel is heavy, do not rely on the weight of the load alone to hold it in place.</p>
</div>

<p>The friction between individual items in the load, and between the load and the load bed, can be very low - particularly for painted or coated products and cold rolled products.</p>

<p>If the vehicle is loaded in an uncovered area, wet or icy weather conditions can also reduce the positive effect of friction.</p>

<h4>Loading against the headboard</h4>
<p>Steel should be loaded so that it is against the headboard of the vehicle if possible.</p>

<p>Loading to the headboard also means that the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>headboard can be considered part of the load securing system</li>
  <li>minimum number of lashings needed will be less than for a load loaded away from the headboard</li>
</ul>

<p>The headboard should be strong enough to prevent the load moving.</p>

<p>If the load comes through the headboard it will go into the driverâs cab, the headboard is critical in protecting the driver. For the same reason, the load should not be loaded above the height of the headboard unless precautions have been taken to stop it sliding forward.</p>

<h4>Securing with chain lashings</h4>
<p>The load should be secured with chain lashings when itâs loaded.</p>

<p>Itâs very important to make sure that all parts of the load are secured. Building the load into a âpyramidâ shape can help to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make sure that the lashings are in contact with the whole load</li>
  <li>stop individual items sliding or toppling</li>
</ul>

<p>Belly-wrapping is particularly useful in securing bundled products.</p>

<p>Chain lashings are very effective in restraining steel and are not damaged by sharp edges like webbing lashings. If any webbing is used, it should be protected from any sharp edges by using either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>webbing sleeves</li>
  <li>edge protectors on the load</li>
</ul>

<p>Side posts or side boards help to protect both other road users and unloading personnel. Theyâre a useful way of making sure the load does not endanger anyone if the lashing system fails for any reason.</p>

<h4>Unloading steel</h4>
<p>Steel can be unloaded by fork lift truck or by crane.</p>

<p>Avoid anyone standing on the load bed during unloading. If this cannot be avoided, you need to think carefully about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where they should stand</li>
  <li>communication with the fork lift truck driver or crane operator</li>
  <li>whether they need fall arrest equipment</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.1 </span> Overview of load securing solutions</h3>

<p>Since the <abbr title="Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency">DVSA</abbr> and <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.hsl.gov.uk/" rel="external">Health and Safety Laboratory</a> initiative on load securing there has been a large increase in the number of load securing solutions available.</p>

<p>These range from systems which reduce the risk of working at height including lashings suspended from bungee cords to specially designed extendable poles used to help the driver.</p>

<p>The following have also become more readily available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>wider lashings</li>
  <li>kites</li>
  <li>sails</li>
  <li>friction mats</li>
  <li>edge protectors</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are valuable tools to help you secure awkward loads to vehicles to reduce the risk of load movements and associated road safety problems.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.2 </span> Securing equipment</h3>

<p>All equipment used to secure a load to a vehicle should be in a good serviceable condition.</p>

<h4>Damage to securing equipment</h4>
<p>Damage to the equipment should be reported and the equipment replaced as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

<h4>Spare equipment</h4>
<p>Spare equipment should be carried to allow the driver to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>supplement the load securing if required</li>
  <li>replace any lashings which have become damaged during transit or where a third party has secured a load inadequately</li>
</ul>

<h4>Inspecting equipment</h4>
<p>You should regularly inspect the state of the vehicle headboard or any other internal bulk head (if used).</p>

<p>Curtains should be inspected and where rips are identified they should be repaired as these will compromise the curtains ability to contain a load should a load shift occur.</p>

<h4>Equipment not in use</h4>
<p>When not in use, the equipment should be stored safely or secured to prevent it falling from the vehicle during transit.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.3 </span> Headboards and bulk head</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> code of practice requires that the load securing systems used should be able to withstand a force not less than 100% of the load to the front.</p>

<p>Generally, but not exclusively, vehicles will rely on a headboard/bulk head or intermediate bulk head to provide this security.</p>

<h4>Inspect the headboard regularly</h4>
<p>You should regularly inspect the headboard to make sure itâs in good condition.</p>

<h4>Different types of headboard</h4>
<p>Different vehicles have different types of headboard and not all are suitable to retain 100% of the load. You should make sure that the headboard fitted to your vehicle is strong enough for the load being carried.</p>

<h4>Put loads as close to the headboard as possible</h4>
<p>To take the full advantage of the bulkhead/headboards loads should be located as close to the bulkhead as possible.</p>

<p>However this might not always be possible due to the potential for exceeding weights or due to the nature of the load itself.</p>

<h4>Fill the gap between the load and headboard</h4>
<p>In situations where the load is not located up to the headboard then ideally suitable blocking or <abbr title="material used to load and secure cargo during transportation">dunnage</abbr> should be used to fill the gap.</p>

<p>The type of blocking used will be dictated by the load carried and the size of the gap, for example the larger the gap the more robust the blocking would need to be.</p>

<p>In some circumstances it would be appropriate to use additional lashings to secure the load rather than blocking.</p>

<h4>Height of the load</h4>
<p>Another issue to consider is the height of the load in relation to the height of the headboard.</p>

<p>Where a vehicle is laden with a large indivisible load, the headboard can provide support as long as the load cannot topple over the height of the headboard.</p>

<p>If the load could topple over the headboard then additional securing will be required, such as cross strapping to the front, if indeed the chosen vehicle is suitable for the load.</p>

<h4>Items above the headboard</h4>
<p>Individual items which are above the headboard (such as scaffolding pipes or large wooden planks) will need either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extra suitable securing to increase the down force</li>
  <li>an intermediate bulkhead</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.4 </span> Rope hooks</h3>

<p>Rope hooks are for securing sheeting to the vehicle, with ropes or nets attached to protect the load from the weather.</p>

<p>They should not be used as an anchor point to secure over-the-top straps or chains.</p>

<p>Drivers who have traditionally âroped and sheetedâ a load using the âklinchâ or âdriversâ knot can use the rope hooks to secure the load to the vehicle if this system is sufficient to do so.</p>

<p>Many drivers do not have the knowledge or ability to rope and sheet as more effective systems have become available.</p>

<h4>Check ropes regularly</h4>
<p>The ropes should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rated and marked as such</li>
  <li>inspected regularly to identify any damage</li>
</ul>

<p>Ropes showing signs of wear should be replaced at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<h4>Over-the-top lashings</h4>
<p>Over-the-top lashings should never be attached to the rope hooks. The tensioning of the lashings could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>damage the hooks</li>
  <li>cause the load to become insecure</li>
</ul>

<p>Lashing straps should attach either directly to the vehicle chassis or rave.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">8.5 </span> Box pusher</h3>

<p>A box pusher uses a hydraulic press to force the box or load towards the headboard or bulkhead of a vehicle or trailer.</p>

<p>It must provide enough security to stop the load from moving during transit. This means that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all parts of the load securing system are in good working order, including the box or container, the vehicle or trailerâs headboard, and the box pusher itself (the hydraulic systems)</li>
  <li>boxes are not double or triple-stacked vertically</li>
  <li>journeys are relatively short (for example, from the field to a storage place)</li>
  <li>vehicles must not exceed the speed limits for agricultural vehicles</li>
</ul>

<p>Use extra securing methods (such as over-the-top lashings) if any of these points are not met.</p>
