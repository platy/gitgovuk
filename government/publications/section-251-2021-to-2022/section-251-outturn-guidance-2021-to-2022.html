<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>About this guidance</h3>

<p>As per <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/251" rel="external">section 251 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009</a>, local authorities are required to submit an education and children and young people’s services outturn statement to the Secretary of State for Education.</p>

<p>The outturn statement applies to the period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>The outturn statement must be submitted by Friday, 26 August 2022.</p>
</div>

<h3>Expiry or review date</h3>

<p>This guidance applies to returns for the financial year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>Who is this publication for?</h3>

<p>This guidance is for local authority finance officers.</p>

<h3>Main points</h3>

<p>Regulatory provisions directly affecting the education content of these outturn statements are also made in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a> .</p>

<p>Where guidance material in this document is interpreted in such a way as to conflict with any regulations currently in force, those regulations take precedence.</p>

<h3>Purpose of financial statements</h3>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to publish their outturn statements as outlined in the 2021 to 2022 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1087182/Outturn_administrative_direction_2021_to_2022.docx" rel="external">administrative direction</a> issued by the Secretary of State for Education.</p>

<p>The section 251 outturn statement is intended to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inform debate around differing levels of expenditure between local authorities and schools</li>
  <li>provide schools, parents and others with an interest in education and children’s services with details about schools and local authority funding and expenditure</li>
  <li>inform HM Treasury for monitoring purposes</li>
  <li>inform Parliament in its role of monitoring the department’s accountability for public funds (MPs ask about school and local authority expenditure via the mechanisms of Parliamentary Questions or through the Education Select Committee)</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, it is important that robust finance data is available. All statements must be prepared to a common format and be accurate.</p>

<p>This will allow the Department for Education (DfE) to use this data in the publication of statistics, in the constructing of benchmarking tables for local authorities, and for answering Parliamentary Questions and other data requests.</p>

<h3>Publication and submission of outturn statements</h3>

<p>Local authorities must submit their 2021 to 2022 outturn statement to the Secretary of State for Education by Friday, 26 August 2022 using DfE’s centralised data collection and management system for education, COLLECT.</p>

<p>Local authorities can return their statements by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manually entering data into COLLECT (<a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/collect-guides-for-schools-and-local-authorities">instructions on how to use COLLECT are available</a>)</li>
  <li>uploading their data to COLLECT in XML format - an XML generator that mirrors the structure of the COLLECT tables is published alongside this guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>A copy of the outturn statement must be made available, as set out in the administrative direction.</p>

<p>Where local authorities adjust their tables to suit their own local publishing standards, all the headings for categories and items of expenditure must be listed, whether or not they are relevant to their expenditure activity in the year.</p>

<p>Local authorities should ensure that when adapting tables for local publication, no font size used in the finished publication is less than 7pt and no shading or colouring is used. Figures might otherwise become unreadable when tables must be photocopied.</p>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/section-251-materials">section 251 collection on GOV.UK</a> contains the most up-to-date reports for all local authorities.</p>

<h3>Technical help with the COLLECT system</h3>

<p>For advice and assistance with meeting the standards and using the system, contact the data collections helpdesk via the <a class="govuk-link" href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schooladmin/ims/datacollections/requestform" rel="external">data collections service request form</a>.</p>

<h3>Direct payments to academies</h3>

<p>Direct payments by local authorities to academies must be recorded in the section 251 tables.</p>

<p>For example, special educational needs (SEN) funding paid by the local authority in respect of top-up funding for individual pupils in academies needs to be included in the appropriate SEN lines.</p>

<h3>FRS17</h3>

<p>These tables should not be completed on an FRS17 or IAS19 basis. Funding for schools should reflect what is actually paid in year.</p>

<h3>Format, content of statements and data entry</h3>

<p>The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1087182/Outturn_administrative_direction_2021_to_2022.docx" rel="external">administrative direction</a> sets out the Secretary of State’s requirements relating to this data collection. Additional information can be entered in the notes section on COLLECT.</p>

<p>The outturn statement must be presented in 2 parts in the order specified below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>table A—this is information at local authority level that provides an overall picture of the expenditure on schools and the amount being spent on education centrally</li>
  <li>
    <p>table A1—this relates to the expenditure on children’s and young people’s services including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sure Start children’s centres and early years</li>
      <li>looked-after children</li>
      <li>other children and family services</li>
      <li>safeguarding children and young people’s services</li>
      <li>family support services</li>
      <li>services for young people and youth justice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Do not use dashes and do not leave blank cells.</p>
</div>

<p>Amounts are to be shown to the nearest whole pound.</p>

<p>If a negative figure is entered into COLLECT, it will automatically be shown in brackets.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">

<h2>Main changes for 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Below you will find details of some of the key changes that we would like to highlight.</p>

<p>We have left in the changes for <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001386/s251_Outturn_2020-21_guidance.pdf" rel="external">the section 251 outturn guidance for 2020 to 2021</a> in addition to adding those for 2021 to 2022, since the budget collection for 2020 to 2021 was cancelled.</p>

<h3>Other general principles</h3>

<p>The header has been changed to ‘Defining what is chargeable to the schools budget’ and has been updated to clarify that the dedicated schools grant (DSG) may not be used for purposes other than those specified in the regulations.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0.2 </span> High needs place funding within individual schools budget</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that funding for nursery places should be included and funding for post-school places should be excluded.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.3 </span> Top-up and other funding - non-maintained and independent providers</h3>

<p>This line has been rewritten to clarify that while independent and non-maintained provision frequently offers integrated education, health and social care provision, only educational costs should be charged to the DSG.</p>

<p>The social care element of accommodating children with special educational needs in schools should be recorded elsewhere (for example 3.1.1).</p>

<p>If health costs are recorded here (for example paid upfront as part of an integrated package of support), they should be recorded with the associated health income.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.5 </span> SEN support services</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify that neither recharges nor the cost of monitoring SEN provision should be included. They should be included in line 2.1.2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.13 </span> Therapies and other health-related services</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify what should be included.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.4.14 </span> Other items</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to say that this line should include funding for additional costs covered from the DSG arising from the increase in the employer’s contribution rate on 1 September 2019 for members of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme that are employed by the local authority and not employed to work in maintained schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7.1 </span> Other specific grants</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify that the early years pupil premium (EYPP) is part of the Early Years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8.1a </span> DSG block breakdown</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that the high needs block figures should exclude funding for post-school places.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.5 </span> Local authority additional contribution</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that if the local authority has a DSG deficit as at the end of the financial year 2020 to 2021, a contribution from non-DSG sources requires the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.4.1 </span> Other specific grants</h3>

<p>Updated to clarify that the EYPP is part of the early years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1.10 </span> Asylum seeker services children</h3>

<p>Updated to include planned expenditure that relates to asylum seeking children that are looked after and have not been recorded in other lines.</p>

<h2>Notes to Table A: local authority level information</h2>

<h3>General principles for completion</h3>

<p>Guidance for the completion of the local authority level information covers the funding period 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>Outturn statements give details of local authority revenue expenditure.</p>

<p>Enter in each line, as appropriate, the amount of spending by the local authority (excluding any delegated or devolved funding) on the expenditure categories in the lines.</p>

<p>Where there is no amount to be entered in any particular cell, use a zero (0).</p>

<p>Administrative costs or overheads attributable to that description of expenditure must be included under the appropriate item head, if necessary, suitably apportioned between school types. Similar treatment will apply to expenditure in relation to support for IT systems.</p>

<h3>High needs expenditure</h3>

<p>This covers expenditure outside the individual schools budget (ISB) on children and young people with special educational needs, and those who require alternative provision (AP).</p>

<h3>Early years expenditure</h3>

<p>This applies whether the provision is attached to a maintained school or whether it is private provision funded by the local authority, but not Sure Start which includes a wide range of services and is included in section 251 table A1.</p>

<h2>Guidance to column headings</h2>

<h3>Early years column</h3>

<p>Includes the free entitlement in maintained nursery schools, nursery classes and private, voluntary and independent providers (including funded childminders), and therefore must include the total expenditure within the early years single funding formula for 2, 3 and 4-year-olds.</p>

<p>Also include other relevant expenditure on early years children, for example the special educational needs inclusion fund top-up grant, the EYPP, and the disability access fund (DAF).</p>

<p>In this column, include everything funded from the DSG early years block relating to children under 5 who are not in reception classes.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Nothing for this age range should appear in the primary column.</p>
</div>

<h3>Primary (reception +) column</h3>

<p>Includes, first, infants, juniors and middle-deemed-primary schools plus units attached to them, such as immigrant centres, and special education units attached to primary phase schools.</p>

<p>This must exclude all expenditure within the early years single funding formula.</p>

<h3>Secondary column</h3>

<p>Includes secondary and middle-deemed-secondary schools. Include all special units attached to secondary schools. Include funding for sixth forms.</p>

<h3>All through schools</h3>

<p>These should be apportioned between phases and between the appropriate columns.</p>

<h3>SEN/special schools column</h3>

<p>this covers special schools and special academies, including hospital schools. Do not include special education units attached to, or resourced provision in, primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h3>AP/pupil referral unit (PRU) column</h3>

<p>This covers PRUs, and other AP made under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/section/19" rel="external">section 19 of the Education Act 1996</a>, including hospital education provision in PRUs and AP academies.</p>

<h3>Post-school column</h3>

<p>This covers further education (FE) colleges, sixth form colleges, independent colleges, special post-16 institutions and other post-16 providers that do not provide for pupils of compulsory school age, including 16 to 19 maintained schools and academies.</p>

<h3>Gross total of all the columns</h3>

<p>The figures entered in each individual column should be gross figures, that is actual total estimated costs of the activities before allowance for any expected income, but after allowing for any buy-back income from the local authority’s own schools to avoid double-counting.</p>

<p>Both expenditure and income should be excluded where maintained schools or recoupment academies within the local authority’s area are buying services. This column should be the total of the previous columns.</p>

<p>COLLECT will include validation on the Table A gross column for those lines where comparisons can be made with the local authority’s 2021 to 2022 budget and 2020 to 2021 outturn figures.</p>

<p>A warning will be created if the total gross for a line is outside a given range compared with the previous year’s expenditure, and local authorities are asked to give explanations in the notes area of COLLECT. The 2021 to 2022 and 2020 to 2021 data used for the comparison and the parameters of the range can be viewed in the error/queries area.</p>

<h3>Income column</h3>

<p>This column should be used for indicating any estimated income the local authority expects to be able to offset against gross expenditure on an activity. This will only include central government grants if they are additional to the DSG and to funding from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) for post-16 provision. The DSG and funding from ESFA for post-16 provision should not be shown as income.</p>

<p>Other grants that should be excluded are universal infant free school meals (UIFSM), PE and sport funding, the teachers’ pay grant, the teachers’ pension grant, and coronavirus (COVID-19) related funding and grants for schools (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for staff who were furloughed by the school, DfE grant scheme for reimbursing exceptional costs, income from COVID-19 catch-up package, COVID-19 testing funding, COVID-19 workforce fund, free school meals (FSM) costs for January to March 2022 where schools were not using national vouchers).</p>

<p>Income sources could also include private sources, fees from other local authorities, charges paid by parents (such as meals, music and board/lodging) and lettings.</p>

<p>Income from maintained schools should not be shown as income. This is because the expenditure is already within the ISB, and this would result in double counting.</p>

<p>No government grants inside or outside Aggregate External Finance (AEF) or ESFA grants should be entered in this column - they should be entered in line 1.7.1 (other specific grants). Milk subsidy, lottery money and any other non-government contributions/grants should be included. Academy income can also be added here.</p>

<h3>Net column</h3>

<p>This column will be calculated automatically.</p>

<h3>Net (budget totals) column</h3>

<p>This column is populated automatically from 2021 to 2022 budget data, and is only shown when reports are produced.</p>

<h2>Defining what is chargeable to the schools expenditure</h2>

<p>Where a local authority is paying a contractor to carry out functions on its behalf, it must include the expenditure information relating to these functions in its statement (amount paid to the contractor by the local authority). Payments under the contract should be apportioned to the relevant functions.</p>

<p>The ISB is allocated to schools without reference to income accruing to schools. Any interest earned on schools’ balances should be excluded from these outturn statements.</p>

<p>For overheads associated with buy back, where delegation is required (that is, where an item falls within the schools budget but is not included in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>, the amount to be delegated should be determined on a full-cost basis inclusive of overheads.</p>

<p>Where a local authority has voluntarily chosen to delegate funding for an item which it could have funded centrally, it is for the local authority to determine the extent to which overheads should be taken into account.</p>

<p>All the financial information in the outturn statement should be represented in pounds and not in thousands.</p>

<p>Items that may be charged to the schools budget are set out in regulations 6 and 8 of part 2 and in schedule 2 to the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 items cannot be included in the schools budget and therefore must, by definition, be in lines 2.1.1 onwards.</p>

<p>The DSG is intended to meet the educational costs of pupils in primary and secondary education, as well as the costs of special educational provision for children and young people with SEN in post-16 provision, including those aged over 19 who have an education, health and care (EHC) plan. The DSG may not be used for purposes other than those specified in the regulations.</p>

<p>Administrative costs and overheads attributable to a particular category of expenditure that regulations allow to be charged to the schools budget should ‘in general’ be included under the appropriate item heading, and if necessary, suitably apportioned between school types.</p>

<p>This may include expenditure in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring payments are made in respect of taxation, National Insurance and superannuation contributions</li>
  <li>recruitment, training, continuing professional development, performance management and personnel management of staff</li>
  <li>investigation and resolution of complaints</li>
  <li>legal services related to education functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Capital charges should not appear in this table in any form except in the case of permitted spend on prudential borrowing and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). However, back pay that is capitalised through the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities should be included.</p>

<p>If funded from central DSG, then it should appear on line 1.4.9 ‘Equal pay – back pay’. If charged to delegated school budgets, then it will fall within the ISB total.</p>

<h2>Schools budget</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0.1 </span> ISB (school budget shares, after academy recoupment), including sixth form grant for maintained schools, but excluding all high needs place funding</h3>

<p>Within the schools budget, the amount available for delegation to schools after provision has been made for retained items is known as the ISB. The same figure will appear in the ‘gross’ and ‘net’ columns.</p>

<p>Line 1.0.1 excludes the high needs place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units (PRUs)</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to nursery, primary and secondary schools and the place funding for the equivalent academies</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, high needs place funding is covered in line 1.0.2. Top-up and other high needs funding for these schools should not be included in this line as they form part of the high needs budget (section 1.2).</p>

<p>The ISB also includes the amount made available to private, voluntary and independent (PVI) providers for the free entitlement for 3 and 4-year-olds. This also includes early years funding for academies. Funding for disadvantaged 2-year-olds should be included within the ISB.</p>

<p>Include the funding for special educational needs inclusion fund top up grant, EYPP and the DAF here.</p>

<p>Funding for maintained secondary schools and PRUs with sixth forms should include funding for the pupils in the sixth forms.</p>

<p>Note that line 1.0.1 is to be shown net of any de-delegated funding that appears in lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.10, and any central provision funded from the budgets of maintained schools that appears in lines 1.6.1 to 1.6.6.</p>

<h3>Free entitlements for 2, 3 and 4-year-olds</h3>

<p>Funding within the schools budget allows for a free entitlement of 15 hours per week per child for disadvantaged 2, 3 and 4-year-olds, and 30 hours per week for working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds.</p>

<p>If a local authority makes payments to maintained schools for early years provision for hours above the universal/additional 15 hours through its early years formula, include this here.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0.2 </span> High needs place funding within ISB (within school budget shares), including all pre and post-16 place funding for maintained schools</h3>

<p>Line 1.0.2 separates out the high needs place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>PRUs</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to nursery, primary and secondary schools</li>
</ul>

<p>High needs place funding for maintained special schools with sixth forms should include the place funding for these 16 to 19 year old pupils; likewise for any special units attached to maintained secondary schools that include 16 to 19 year old pupils.</p>

<p>For special units and resourced provision in primary and secondary schools, special schools and PRUs the delegated amount is only the place funding under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/regulation/14/made" rel="external">regulation 14 of the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>. Top-up funding will appear in section 1.2 of the form.</p>

<p>Funding for nursery places funded from the high needs block should also be included.</p>

<p>Do not include place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>academies and free schools</li>
  <li>FE colleges</li>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>independent colleges</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions and other post-16 providers that do not provide for pupils of compulsory school age</li>
  <li>maintained schools and academies that provide only for 16 to 19-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.0.1 </span> and 1.0.2</h3>

<p>The total of these 2 lines will be the equivalent of the single line 1.0.1 before 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>Total ISB must be consistent with figures for maintained schools recorded in the local authority proforma tool (APT) and accompanying tables submitted to ESFA in January, and should include the following when populated in the workbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years column - the total early years single funding formula including PVIs, maintained nursery schools and nursery classes, SEN inclusion fund top-up grant, EYPP and DAF</li>
  <li>primary column - total budget share including all primary minimum funding guarantee with the early years element removed</li>
  <li>secondary column - total budget share, including sixth forms and including all secondary minimum funding guarantee with the early years element removed</li>
  <li>special schools column - total budget share, including sixth forms (the high needs place funding)</li>
  <li>AP/PRUs column - total budget share (for example, the high needs place funding)</li>
</ul>

<h2>De-delegated items</h2>

<p>These only apply to maintained primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1.1 </span> Contingencies</h3>

<p>Include expenditure as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">part 1 of the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>. This ‘expenditure on the schools specific contingency’ is central expenditure deducted for the purpose of ensuring that monies are available to enable increases in a school’s budget share after it has been allocated, and where a governing body has incurred expenditure where it would be unreasonable to expect it to meet this from the school’s budget share.</p>

<p>This may include expenditure in relation to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools in financial difficulty</li>
  <li>the writing-off of deficits of schools which are discontinued, excluding any associated costs and overheads</li>
  <li>new, amalgamating or closing schools</li>
  <li>other expenditure where such circumstances were unforeseen when initially determining the school’s budget share</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1.7 </span> Licences/subscriptions</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on licence fees or subscriptions paid on behalf of maintained schools. A number of licences are now dealt with through a central contract with DfE, and funding to pay for this (for maintained schools and recoupment academies) should appear in line 1.4.14 ‘Other items’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1.8 </span> Staff costs - supply cover (excluding cover for facility time)</h3>

<p>Include expenditure in making payments to, or in providing a temporary replacement for:</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1.10 </span> School improvement</h3>

<p>School improvement de-delegation covers any additional school improvement activities provided for maintained schools by the local authority that are not included within the scope of the separate local authority grant for school intervention and improvement (see line 2.0.3).</p>

<p>The grant covers activities in relation to intervening in underperforming maintained schools, monitoring maintained schools in order to identify those at risk of becoming eligible for intervention, and the commissioning of support for them.</p>

<h2>High needs expenditure</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.1 </span> Top-up funding - maintained schools</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on top-up funding for maintained schools, including PRUs. Top-up funding is paid to schools for pupils with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream classes</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream schools</li>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>PRUs</li>
  <li>sixth forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Top-up funding is usually administered directly by local authorities from a central high needs budget. Where such funding has been devolved to groups of schools or individual schools for them to decide what to pay other schools (for example, when a school pays top-up funding for a pupil it places in a PRU), this funding should also be included. It is important, however, that this excludes any funding already in schools’ budget shares and included in line 1.0.1.</p>

<p>This line should also include any high needs funding paid to maintained special schools and PRUs for teachers’ pay and pensions (employer contributions) costs, under the additional condition of grant attached to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022#grant-allocation-and-payment">local authorities’ DSG (section 3.6(7)</a>)</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.2 </span> Top-up funding - academies, free schools and colleges</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on top-up funding for academies and free schools.</p>

<p>Top-up funding is paid to academies for pupils with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream classes</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream academies and free schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>AP academies and free schools</li>
  <li>academy and free school sixth forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Also include in the post-school column top-up funding for students with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FE colleges</li>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>16 to 19 schools and academies without pupils of compulsory school age</li>
  <li>local authority post-16 provision</li>
</ul>

<p>Top-up funding is usually administered directly by local authorities from a central high needs budget. Where such funding has been devolved to schools and academies for them to decide what to pay other schools (for example, when an academy pays top-up funding for a pupil it places in an AP free school), this funding should also be included. It is important, however, that this excludes any funding already in academies’ budget shares and included in line 1.0.1.</p>

<p>This line should also include any high needs funding paid to special academies and free schools, and to AP academies and free schools, for teachers’ pay and pensions (employer contributions) costs, under the additional condition of grant attached to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022#grant-allocation-and-payment">local authorities’ DSG (section 3.6(7)</a>.</p>

<p>Also include any post-16 place funding for academies, free schools or colleges that has been retained by the local authority in 2021 to 2022, rather than recouped by ESFA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.3 </span> Top-up and other funding - non-maintained and independent providers</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on top-up funding for non-maintained special schools in the special schools column.</p>

<p>Expenditure on pupils with EHC plans at independent schools, including pupils in sixth forms. Most of these independent schools are special schools, so the expenditure should normally be included in the special school column.</p>

<p>Expenditure on mainstream independent schools should be recorded in the primary or secondary columns, as for mainstream maintained schools and academies</p>

<p>In the post-school column, include expenditure on top-up funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students at independent learning providers of post-16 education and training (previously called commercial and charitable providers)</li>
  <li>independent specialist colleges</li>
  <li>other independent special post-16 institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>While independent and non-maintained provision frequently offers integrated education, health and social care provision, only educational costs should be charged to the DSG. The social care element of accommodating children with SEN in schools should be recorded elsewhere (for example, 3.1.1).</p>

<p>In the event that health costs are recorded here (for example, paid upfront as part of an integrated package of support), they should be recorded with the associated health income.</p>

<p>Also include any post-16 place funding for these institutions that has been retained by the local authority in 2021 to 2022 rather than recouped by ESFA.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.4 </span> Additional high needs targeted funding for mainstream schools and academies</h3>

<p>Include expenditure from the local authority’s high needs budget which is given to mainstream schools and academies (and exceptionally colleges) to ensure that they have enough funding to meet additional support costs up to £6,000 for pupils with SEN, where they cannot reasonably do this out of their budget share or other mainstream funding.</p>

<p>Local authorities were asked to give more detailed information about such targeted funding for mainstream schools in their <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/authority-proforma-tool-apt-information-for-local-authorities">APT return</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.5 </span> SEN support services</h3>

<p>Include the costs of non-delegated centrally retained specialist SEN support services for pupils with or without statements or EHC plans, whether supported directly by the local authority or commissioned by them.</p>

<p>This will include services for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visual, hearing and physical impairment</li>
  <li>specific learning difficulties</li>
  <li>speech</li>
  <li>language and communication</li>
  <li>profound and severe learning difficulties</li>
  <li>autism</li>
</ul>

<p>You should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the costs of these services for 0 to 5-year-olds</li>
  <li>any costs of providing these services to home educated children</li>
  <li>the costs of early years special education needs coordinators (SENCOs) who are centrally managed across a number of early years providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include the costs of behaviour support services which are not in support of SEN (see line 1.1.2)</p>

<p>Do not include recharges or the cost of monitoring SEN provision.&nbsp;This should be included in the ‘Other Education and Community Budget, 2.1.2 Monitoring of SEN provision’.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.6 </span> Hospital education services</h3>

<p>Hospital education is defined in the regulations as education provided at a community special school or foundation special school established in a hospital (usually called a hospital school), or under any arrangements made by the local authority under section 19 of the Education Act 1996. This is normally provision in PRUs or services centrally managed by the local authority, where the child is being provided with such education by reason of a decision made by a medical practitioner.</p>

<p>In line 1.2.6 only, include expenditure on hospital education services. It should include both services made available to children and young people resident in the local authority’s area and services made available to those who are in the area because that is where they are receiving their health care. It should also include expenditure on the local authority’s pupils who are receiving their education from an independent hospital education provider.</p>

<p>It is important to exclude from this line any funding for hospital education places in special schools (including those special schools that are hospital schools) or PRUs (sometimes these are known as medical PRUs), which should instead be included in line 1.0.2.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.7 </span> Other AP services</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on AP services provided directly or commissioned by the local authority. This may include funding for parents who are educating at home.</p>

<p>Also include funding for AP providers other than PRUs, AP academies and AP free schools. Include funding for commissioned services delivered by PRUs, AP academies and AP free schools, but exclude any funding for high needs places at PRUs (which should instead be included in line 1.0.2) and any top-up funding in respect of pupils at these providers (see lines 1.2.2 and 1.2.3).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.2.8 </span> Support for inclusion</h3>

<p>Include expenditure for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collaboration between mainstream and special schools and primary and secondary schools to enable children with special educational needs to take part in mainstream activities</li>

<p>This line should reflect the total funding for early years contingency and centrally retained spending for the 2, 3 and 4-year-olds early years entitlements.</p>

<h2>Central provision within schools budget</h2>

<p>The finance regulations restrict a number of central schools block lines to historic commitments entered into prior to 1 April 2013 and the budget for these cannot increase over the budget held in 2012 to 2013. The relevant expenditure lines are 1.4.1, 1.4.4, 1.4.6, 1.4.7 and 1.4.11.</p>

<p>These are defined in regulations as:</p>

<p>‘Expenditure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Part 1 (Historic Commitments) of schedule 2 may only be deducted by the local authority where the expenditure is to be incurred as a result of decisions taken before 1 April 2013 that commit the local authority to incur expenditure in the funding period.’</p>

<p>The ‘funding period’ here refers to the forthcoming financial year.</p>

<p>Schedule 2 also states that, other than in the case of paragraph 1 (capital expenditure funded from revenue), the schools forum or the Secretary of State must have approved the original decision. Schedule 2 does not allow local authorities to maintain a budget of indefinite size for an indefinite period against these funding lines.</p>

The regulations (paragraph 24 of schedule 2) allow authorities to charge to the schools budget 30.5% of the total employer contribution to the pension costs for such teachers. Many of these teachers’ salaries will be funded from the schools budget (e.g. in line 1.2.5) and in that case the full cost of the teacher should be entered in that line; but where the teacher’s salary would appear in section 2, or would not appear on this form at all, the chargeable pension cost contribution should appear in this line.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.7.1 </span> Other specific grants</h3>

<p>Include other specific grants, whether devolved or not devolved to schools.</p>

<p>Do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any grants with specific allocation conditions, such as the DSG</li>
  <li>any element of the pupil premium grant (which should not be entered anywhere on the form)</li>
  <li>sixth form funding</li>
  <li>UIFSM</li>
  <li>free school meal supplementary grant</li>
  <li>PE and sport funding</li>
  <li>teachers’ pay grant</li>
  <li>teachers’ pension employer contribution grant or supplementary fund</li>
  <li>COVID-19 grants for schools should also be excluded (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for staff who were furloughed by the school, DfE grant scheme for reimbursing exceptional costs, income from COVID-19 catch-up package, COVID-19 testing funding, COVID-19 workforce fund, FSM costs for January to March 2021 where schools were not using national vouchers).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the EYPP is part of the early years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>

<p>Where this line is used both the grant and the expenditure funded by the grant should be entered, so that the line nets to zero in all circumstances (local authorities should be planning to spend all of the grants, since grants cannot be used for any other purpose).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.8.1 </span> Total schools expenditure (after academy recoupment)</h3>

<p>Memorandum line 1.8.1a:</p>

<p>Please enter the allocated DSG funding and expenditure for the four blocks shown on the local authority table. Allocated DSG funding should be taken from the tables of 2021 to 2022 DSG allocations published by DfE on 16 March 2022, after deductions for post-school high needs place funding, and any recoupment for academies.</p>

<p>Actual spending should be derived from the net spending entered in sections 1.0 to 1.6 of the table, appropriately assigned against the four DSG blocks.</p>

<p>Where a transfer has been made between blocks, the spending will appear against the block where it was actually spent, e.g. high needs rather than schools. You should, however, ensure that all expenditure supported by the funding in line 1.9.4 (grant supporting post-16 education) is excluded from this table.</p>

<p>In general terms, we would expect that expenditure entered in the early years column would relate to the early years block. For the other columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>line 1.0.1, section 1.1, lines 1.4.5, 1.4.10 and 1.4.13, and section 1.6 would relate to the schools block</li>
  <li>line 1.0.2, section 1.2 and line 1.4.11 would relate to the high needs block</li>
  <li>the rest of section 1.4 along with section 1.5 would relate to the central school services block</li>
</ul>

<p>However, local authorities may have other ways of attributing expenditure, particularly as regards early years pupils with high needs, and should assign expenditure in line with local practice.</p>

<p>Expenditure should include everything that has actually been spent, regardless of whether the source of funding is 2021 to 2022 DSG, funds brought forward from previous years or a deficit to be carried forward to the following year.</p>

<h2>Reconciliation of schools expenditure (after academy recoupment)</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.1 </span> DSG for 2021 to 2022 (after academy recoupment and deductions for academy and post school high needs place funding)</h3>

<p>The local authority’s DSG after recoupment. This is the final DSG, as notified in March 2022, adjusted by the deductions from the high needs block of place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream academies</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>AP academies and free schools</li>
  <li>hospital academies</li>
  <li>16 to 19 academies and free schools,</li>
  <li>FE colleges and independent learning providers</li>
  <li>the early years block</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.1a </span> DSG in-year adjustments</h3>

<p>Changes to the final DSG allocation, as notified in March 2022, for example, adjustments for exclusions, or final early years block adjustment.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.2 </span> DSG brought forward from 2020 to 2021</h3>

<p>The total amount of DSG reserves brought forward from previous years. Reserves should be entered as a positive number and deficits as a negative number.</p>

<p>These will result from carry forward from financial years before 2020 to 2021 plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the difference between the final DSG in 2020 to 2021 and earlier estimates of DSG on which the schools budget was based</li>
  <li>an under or overspend in 2020 to 2021 against the central elements of the schools budget</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.3 </span> DSG carry forward to 2022 to 2023 (negative or positive)</h3>

<p>Include any amount which the local authority is carrying forward to 2022 to 2023 from the 2021 to 2022 DSG, or from DSG carried over from earlier years. A negative number represents a reserve being carried forward, and a positive number indicates a deficit being carried forward.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.4 </span> Grant for maintained school sixth forms</h3>

<p>This is a grant supporting post-16 education in maintained schools. This includes student financial support funding for special schools. The corresponding expenditure should be shown in the ‘Secondary’ column of line 1.0.1.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.5 </span> Local authority additional contribution</h3>

<p>This includes any additional funding provided by the local authority to support the schools budget. If the local authority had a DSG deficit as at the end of the financial year 2020 to 2021, a contribution from non-DSG sources requires the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.9.6 </span> Total funding supporting the schools budget (lines 1.9.1 to 1.9.5)</h3>

<p>This line records the total sources of income to the schools budget, taking into account balances brought forward from 2020 to 2021 and those it is carrying forward to 2022 to 2023, as well as any additional funds provided by the local authority. This line should match the local authority’s actual spending from the schools budget (line 1.8.1).</p>

<h2>Other education and community budget</h2>

<p>Subject to what is said below in relation to specific grants, administrative costs and overheads attributable to a particular category of expenditure should be included under the appropriate item head. Similar treatment applies to expenditure in relation to support for IT systems.</p>

<p>The lines on section 2.0 relate to functions formerly funded from ESG. They should be used to record provision for these functions that is not funded from DSG in 2021 to 2022, and is funded from the local authority grant for school intervention and improvement, or other council sources of funding rather than from DSG. It is therefore not part of the schools budget.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2.0.1 </span> Central support services</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupil support - provision and administration of clothing grants and board and lodging grants, where such expenditure is not supported by a grant</li>

<h2>Notes to Table A1: children and young people’s services</h2>

<p>The split below is to show which services are being provided by the local authority and which are being provided by external organisations. Costs paid to external bodies (or individuals) as part of authority managed services count as ‘Own provision’.</p>

<p>For example, agency staff or individual carers selected and paid directly by the local authority should always be classified under ‘Own provision’. If a third party employs or contracts with the individual service providers, then it is not ‘Own provision’.</p>

<p>Guidance to column headings (a), (b), (c) and (d):</p>

<ul>
  <li>column (a) ‘Own Provision’—expenditure on services provided/managed by the local authority</li>
  <li>column (b) ‘Private’—expenditure on services provided/managed by private sector entities such as profit-making companies</li>
  <li>column (c) ‘Other Public’—expenditure on services provided/managed by public sector entities such as other local authorities and other public providers (such as services provided by other local authorities or health bodies)</li>
  <li>Column (d) ‘Voluntary’—expenditure on services provided/managed by third sector entities such as voluntary and community groups, social enterprises, charities, cooperatives and mutuals</li>
</ul>

<p>When completing the income column:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where relevant, complete the income column, including income derived from any charges to parents for services, charges to other centre users (for example rental of rooms), and any other grant income</li>
  <li>do not record central government grants as income</li>
</ul>
