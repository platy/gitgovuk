<h2>Summary</h2>

<h3>About this departmental advice</h3>

<p>Local authorities are required under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/22/section/251/enacted" rel="external">section 251 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009</a> to prepare and submit to the Secretary of State for Education an education and children and young people’s services budget statement not later than 30 April 2021 for the prescribed period. The prescribed period for this budget statement covers 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022.</p>

<p>If a local authority fails to submit its budget return by 30 April 2021, or does not exercise its functions properly, the Department for Education (DfE) can exercise its powers of intervention under paragraphs 496 and 497 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/contents" rel="external">Education Act 1996.</a></p>

<p>In addition DfE can discount any late budget statements from publication due to reduced validation capacity.</p>

<p>Separate guidance applies to the preparation of the outturn statement.</p>

<p>Regulatory provisions directly affecting the education content of these budget statements are also made in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Where guidance material in this document is interpreted in such a way as to conflict with any regulations currently in force, those regulations take precedence.</p>

<h3>Expiry or review date</h3>

<p>This advice applies to the returns for the financial year 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h3>Who this publication is for</h3>

<p>This advice is for local authority finance officers.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Purpose of financial statements</h3>

<p>Local authorities have a statutory duty to publish their budget statements as and when prescribed in the administrative direction issued by the Secretary of State for Education. A separate administrative direction and guidance apply to outturn statements.</p>

<p>The copy of the statement that schools receive for that period is intended to provide a clear picture of the local authority’s planned spending. This includes how much the local authority intends to spend on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the schools budget</li>
  <li>de-delegated items</li>
  <li>the high needs budget</li>
  <li>the early years’ budget</li>
  <li>central provision within the schools budget</li>
  <li>children and young people’s services</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that schools forums and others can compare funding between different local authorities, to allow for an informed debate about budget levels and use of funds. It is therefore essential that all statements are prepared to a common format and are accurate.</p>

<p>The statements are used by DfE for the publication of statistics, for constructing benchmarking tables for local authorities, and for answering parliamentary questions and other requests for data.</p>

<h3>Submitting the budget statement</h3>

<p>Local authorities must submit their budget statement for the prescribed period to the Secretary of State for Education by 30 April 2021. For the 2021 to 2022 budget collection local authorities can return their statements by either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>manually entering data into COLLECT (instructions on how to use COLLECT are available): you will be notified when the system goes live in March 2021</li>
  <li>uploading their data to COLLECT in XML format: an XML generator that mirrors the structure of the COLLECT tables will be made available in advance of the collection</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note the published section 251 tables should not be used or submitted to DfE, as they are for illustration purposes only.</p>
</div>

<h3>Technical help with the COLLECT system</h3>

<p>Requests for technical help with entering your data, or how to use the COLLECT system or proforma should be directed to the data collections helpdesk via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Data-collections-service-request-form" rel="external">data collections service request form.</a></p>

<h3>Direct payments to academies</h3>

<p>Direct payments by local authorities to academies must be recorded in the section 251 tables. For example, special educational needs (SEN) funding paid by the local authority in respect of top-up funding for individual pupils in academies needs to be included in the appropriate SEN lines.</p>

<h3>FRS17</h3>

<p>These tables should not be completed on a FRS17 or IAS19 basis. Funding for schools should reflect what is actually paid in year.</p>

<h3>Format and content of statements</h3>

<p>The administrative direction sets out the Secretary of State’s requirements relating to this data collection. Additional information or supplementary notes should be provided as necessary, separate to the statement itself. This can either be in the form of an additional annex or in the notes section of the template/proforma.</p>

<p>The funding data and financial monitoring (FDFM) team are happy to provide advice on what form any additional information should take by contacting us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk.">S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk.</a></p>

<p>You will be alerted when cells have been left blank. If this is the case, zeros must be entered where there is no planned expenditure; dashes must not be used, and cells must not be left blank.</p>

<p>Both the system and proforma will, where appropriate, validate the figures at source or carry out calculations (this is done within the template). This saves time for those completing the tables and also for those receiving them. The FDFMT will, however, follow up on any additional data validation issues with the relevant authorities at a later date.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that you complete your data entry as accurately as possible. It is also important that you take every opportunity to review and revise your data once the FDFM team undertakes the data validation process.</p>

<h3>Revised statements</h3>

<p>Revised statements can only be accepted if amendments are made as a result of errors being identified and corrected.</p>

<p>Any revised versions should reflect the situation as of 30 April 2021. If in doubt, please contact <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk">S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk</a> to discuss.</p>

<h3>Publishing the budget statement</h3>

<p>A copy of the budget statement must be made available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to every school maintained by local authorities: if a school does not have access to the internet, the local authority must provide a hard copy of each budget statement including, table 1 (local authority information covering de-delegated items, high needs budget, early years budget and children’s social care), table 2 (high needs – special and alternative provision (AP) – settings), and the early years proforma, to the governing body and headteacher</li>
  <li>to those private, voluntary and independent providers (PVI providers) who are funded to provide free early provision to 2, 3 and 4-year-olds: the local authority must show how they can access a copy of the budget statement</li>
  <li>to the general public: the local authority must make a copy of the whole statement available at their education offices (where a copy must be available for inspection by parents and others in the community at all reasonable times and free of charge)</li>
  <li>on a website: the local authority must make a copy of the whole statement available on a website which is maintained by the local authority and accessible by the public</li>
</ul>

<p>Where local authorities adjust their tables to suit their own local publishing standards, all the headings for categories and items of expenditure must be listed, whether or not they are relevant to their expenditure activity in the year.</p>

<p>Local authorities should ensure that when adapting tables for local publication, no font size used in the finished publication is less than 7 pt. and no shading or colouring is used. Figures might otherwise become unreadable when tables have to be photocopied.</p>

<h3>Production of outputs from COLLECT</h3>

<p>Once you have entered your data you will be able to produce a budget report suite for publication from the COLLECT system. The budget statement must then be published and presented in 3 parts, for the prescribed period. The tables should appear on the local authority’s website in the following order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Table 1 local authority level information provides an overall picture of the funding being allocated direct to schools, the amount being spent on education centrally and the amount being spent on children’s and young people’s services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Table 2 school table high needs and AP settings lists the place numbers and funding in each maintained setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early years proforma this provides a format for local authorities to record details of their early years single funding formula, including the 3 and 4-year-old free entitlements (the universal 15 hours and additional 15 hours for working parents) and the 2-year-old entitlement. Local authorities will also need to confirm their planned budget for the special educational needs (SEN) inclusion fund top-up grant, early years pupil premium (EYPP), and the disability access fund (DAF). Please see the early years proforma guidance.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Main changes for 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022</h2>

<p>Below you will find details of some of the main changes we would like to highlight. We have left in the changes for 2020 to 2021, as well as adding those for 2021 to 2022, since the collection for 2020 to 2021 was cancelled.</p>

<h3>Other General Principles</h3>

<p>The header has been changed to ‘defining what is chargeable to the schools budget’ and has been updated to clarify that the DSG may not be used for purposes other than those specified in the regulations.</p>

<h3>High needs place funding within individual schools budget (1.0.2)</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that funding for nursery places should be included and funding for post-school places should be excluded.</p>

<h3>Top-up and other funding – non-maintained and independent providers (1.2.3)</h3>

<p>This line has been re-written to clarify that while independent and non-maintained provision frequently offers integrated education, health and social care provision, only educational costs should be charged to the DSG.</p>

<p>The social care element of accommodating children with special educational needs in schools should be recorded elsewhere (for example 3.1.1). In the event that health costs are recorded here (for example paid up-front as part of an integrated package of support), they should be recorded with associated health income</p>

<h3>SEN support services (1.2.5)</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify that neither recharges nor the cost of monitoring SEN provision should not be included. They should be included in line 2.1.2.</p>

<h3>Therapies and other health related services (1.2.13)</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify what should be included.</p>

<h3>Other items (1.4.14)</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to say that this line should include funding for additional costs covered from the dedicated schools grant (DSG) arising from the increase in the employer’s contribution rate on 1 September 2019 for members of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme that are employed by the local authority and not employed to work in maintained schools.</p>

<h3>Other specific grants (1.7.1)</h3>

<p>This line has been updated to clarify that the early years pupil premium is part of the early years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>

<h3>DSG block breakdown (1.8.1a)</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that the high needs block figures should exclude funding for post-school places.</p>

<h3>Local authority additional contribution (1.9.5)</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that if the local authority has a DSG deficit as at the end of the financial year 2020 to 2021, a contribution from non-DSG sources requires the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h3>Academy: recoupment from the dedicated schools grant of high needs place funding (1.10.2)</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that local authorities should use the March 2021 recoupment figures that reflect the outcomes of the place change process, and that recoupment for post-school places should be excluded.</p>

<h3>Other specific grants (2.4.1)</h3>

<p>Updated to clarify that the early years pupil premium is part of the early years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>

<h3>Asylum seeker services children (3.1.10)</h3>

<p>Updated to include planned expenditure that relates to asylum seeking children that are looked after that have not been recorded in other lines.</p>

<h3>High needs places table</h3>

<p>Guidance has been updated to clarify that nursery places funded from the high needs block should be included, as well as 16 to 19 places in special units and resourced provision in mainstream schools.</p>

<p>The ‘total deduction for services to maintained schools formerly funded through the ESG’ column has been removed.</p>

<h3>Advice on the regulations and guidance</h3>

<p>For advice on the contents of the regulations and guidance, local authorities should contact the Funding Data and Financial Monitoring team (FDFM) at: <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk">S251.BUDGETQUERIES@education.gov.uk</a></p>

<h2>Notes on completing the local authority table</h2>

<h3>General principles</h3>

<p>Budget statements give details of planned expenditure for the school sectors. The below sets out what should be included in each section.</p>

<h4>Early years column</h4>

<p>Includes the free entitlement in maintained nursery schools, nursery classes and private, voluntary and independent providers (including childminders). It therefore must include the total expenditure within the early years single funding formula for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the 15-hour entitlement for disadvantaged 2-year-olds</li>
  <li>3 and 4-year-olds entitlements for both the universal 15 hours and additional 15 hours for eligible working parents</li>
</ul>

<p>Also include other relevant expenditure on early years children, including the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special educational needs inclusion fund top-up grant</li>
  <li>early years pupil premium (EYPP)</li>
  <li>disability access fund (DAF)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the early years proforma guidance. In this column include everything funded from the dedicated schools grant (DSG) early years block relating to children under 5 who are not in reception classes 
Nothing for this age range should appear in the primary column.</p>

<h4>Primary (reception) column</h4>

<p>Includes, first, infants, juniors and middle-deemed primary schools plus funding for units attached to them, such as immigrant centres, and special units and resourced provision for pupils with SEN attached to primary phase schools. This must exclude all expenditure within the early years single funding formula. 
Pre-16 funding should be compatible with what has been submitted in the authority proforma tool (APT).</p>

<h4>Secondary column</h4>

<p>Includes secondary and middle-deemed secondary schools. Include funding for all special units and resourced provision attached to secondary schools. Include funding for sixth forms in schools. 
Pre-16 funding should be compatible with what has been submitted in the authority proforma tool (APT). 
All through schools should be apportioned between phases and between the appropriate columns, using the split shown on the authority proforma tool as a basis.</p>

<h4>Special schools column</h4>

<p>This covers special schools and special academies, including those hospital schools that are a type of special school. Do not include funding for special education units attached to, or resourced provision in, mainstream schools.</p>

<h4>AP/PRUs column</h4>

<p>This covers pupil referral units, alternative provision (AP) academies and other alternative provision made under section 19 of the Education Act 1996, including hospital education provision in pupil referral units (PRUs) and AP academies.</p>

<h4>Post-school column</h4>

<p>This covers further education (FE) colleges, sixth form colleges, independent colleges, special post-16 institutions and other post-16 providers that do not provide for pupils of compulsory school age, including 16 to 19 maintained schools and academies.</p>

<h4>Gross total of all the columns</h4>

<p>The figures entered in each individual column should be gross figures—that is actual total estimated costs of the activities before allowance for any expected income, but after allowing for any ‘buyback’ income from the local authority’s own schools to avoid double counting. Both expenditure and income should be excluded where maintained schools or recoupment academies within the local authority’s area are buying services. This column should be the total of the previous columns.</p>

<h4>Income column</h4>

<p>This column should be used for indicating any estimated income the local authority expects to be able to offset against gross expenditure on an activity. This will only include central government grants if they are additional to the DSG and to funding from ESFA for post-16 provision. The DSG and funding from ESFA for post-16 provision should not be shown as income.</p>

<p>Other grants that should be excluded are universal infant free school meals (UIFSM), free school meal supplementary funding, PE and sport funding, year 7 catch-up funding and public health grant. This should also exclude internal departmental recharges and DSG recharges. Income sources could include private sources, other local authorities’ fees, charges paid by parents (such as meals, music, board/lodging) and lettings.</p>

<p>Income from schools and academies should not be shown as income, because the expenditure is already within the individual schools budget (ISB) and this would result in double counting.</p>

<h4>Net column</h4>

<p>This column will be calculated automatically.</p>

<p>Where a local authority is paying a contractor to carry out functions on its behalf, then the local authority must include budget information relating to these functions in its statement (the amount paid to the contractor by the local authority). Payments under the contract should be apportioned to the relevant functions. 
The ISB is allocated to schools without reference to income accruing to schools. Any interest earned on schools’ balances should be excluded from these budget statements.</p>

<p>For overheads associated with ‘buy-back’, where delegation is required (that is, where an item falls within the schools budget but is not included in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021)</a> the amount to be delegated should be determined on a full-cost basis inclusive of overheads. Where a local authority has voluntarily chosen to delegate funding for an item that it could have funded centrally, it is for the local authority to determine the extent to which overheads should be taken into account.</p>

<p>All the financial information in the budget statement should be represented in pounds and not in thousands. 
The Education Support Grant (ESG) for local authorities ceased with effect from September 2017. The treatment of services formerly funded through ESG is discussed here.</p>

<h3>Defining what is chargeable to the schools budget</h3>

<p>Items that may be charged to the schools budget are set out in regulations 6 &amp; 8 of Part 2 and in Schedule 2 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 items cannot be included in the schools budget and therefore must, by definition, be in lines 2.1.1 onwards. The DSG is intended to meet the educational costs of pupils in primary and secondary education, as well as the costs of special educational provision for children and young people with special educational needs in post-16 provision, including those aged over 19 who have an education, health and care (EHC) plan. The DSG may not be used for purposes other than those specified in the regulations.</p>

<p>Administrative costs and overheads attributable to a particular category of expenditure that regulations allow to be charged to the schools budget should in general be included under the appropriate item heading, if necessary, suitably apportioned between school types. This may include expenditure in relation to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensuring payments are made in respect of taxation, National Insurance and superannuation contributions</li>
  <li>recruitment, training, continuing professional development, performance management and personnel management of staff</li>
  <li>investigation and resolution of complaints</li>
  <li>legal services related to education functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Except in the case of permitted spend on prudential borrowing and Capital Expenditure from Revenue (CERA), capital charges should not appear in this table in any form. However, back pay that is capitalised through Communities and Local Government (CLG) should be included. If funded from central DSG, then it should appear on line 1.4.9, equal pay/back pay. If charged to delegated school budgets, then it will fall within the ISB total.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, educational provision will be delivered in schools or colleges. However, in some cases, specific types of health or social care provision may be considered as educating or training. This particularly applies to therapies such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.</p>

<p>The Children and Families Act 2014 requires that health or social care provision which educates or trains a child or young person must be treated as special educational provision. This means that it will be recorded in section F of an EHC plan and will be treated as special educational provision. It is therefore in scope of the high needs budget. However, all decisions about whether health care provision or social care provision should be treated as special educational provision must be made on an individual basis.</p>

<p>Case law from the first-tier tribunal has established that only the specific elements of health or social care provision which educate or train can be considered as special educational provision. The fact that health or social care provision is intended to support a child or young person to access learning, for example, does not mean that it should be considered as special educational provision.</p>

<h3>Schools budget</h3>

<h4>Individual schools budget (school budget shares, before academy recoupment), including sixth form grant for maintained schools, but excluding all high needs place funding (1.0.1)</h4>

<p>Within the schools budget, the amount available for delegation to schools after provision has been made for retained items is known as the individual schools budget (ISB). The same figure will appear in the ‘gross’ and the ‘net’ columns.</p>

<p>From 2018 to 2019, line 1.0.1 excludes the high needs place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to nursery, primary and secondary schools (as specified in table 2) and the place funding for the equivalent academies</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, this high needs place funding is specified in line 1.0.2. Places in mainstream schools that are not in a special unit or resourced provision should be included in line 1.0.1. Top-up and other high needs funding for these schools should not be included in this line as they form part of the high needs budget (section 1.2).</p>

<p>The ISB also includes the amount made available to private, voluntary and independent (PVI) providers for the free entitlement for 3 and 4-year-olds. This also includes early years funding for academies. Funding for disadvantaged 2-year-olds should be included within the ISB.</p>

<p>Please include the funding for special educational needs inclusion fund top-up grant, early years pupil premium (EYPP) and the disability access fund (DAF) here. This information is also required in the early years proforma.</p>

<p>This line should include funding that the local authority would have made available to primary and secondary academies funded through recoupment, as if it was still funding them. The corresponding expected recoupment should be entered in line 1.10.1.</p>

<p>Funding for maintained secondary schools and pupil referral units with sixth forms should include funding for the pupils in the sixth forms. Funding for the sixth form pupils in academies should not be included since that does not pass through the local authority.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note that line 1.0.1 is to be shown net of any de-delegated funding that appears in lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.10, and any central provision funded from the budgets of maintained schools that appears in lines 1.6.1 to 1.6.6.</p>
</div>

<h4>Free entitlements for 2-year-olds, and 3 and 4-year-olds</h4>

<p>Funding within the schools budget allows for a free entitlement of 15 hours per week per child for disadvantaged 2-year-olds, and for 3 and 4-year-olds, and 30 hours per week for working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds. 
Show here if a local authority makes payments to maintained schools for early years provision for hours above the universal/additional 15 hours through its early years formula.</p>

<h4>High needs place funding within individual schools budget (within school budget shares, before academy recoupment), including all pre and post-16 place funding for maintained schools and academies (1.0.2)</h4>

<p>From 2018 to 2019 this new line, 1.0.2, separates out the high needs place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>pupil referral units</li>
  <li>hospital schools</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to nursery, primary and secondary schools (as specified in table 2) and the place funding for the equivalent academies</li>
</ul>

<p>This line should include high needs place funding that the local authority would have made available to special and alternative provision (AP) academies funded through recoupment if it was still funding them, and the place funding in special free schools that the local authority is required to fund from its DSG. The corresponding expected recoupment should be entered in line 1.10.2.</p>

<p>High needs place funding for maintained special schools and special academies (and free schools) with sixth forms should include the place funding for these 16 to 19-year-old pupils; likewise for any special units attached to secondary schools that include 16 to 19-year-old pupils.</p>

<p>For special units and resourced provision in primary and secondary schools, special schools and pupil referral units, the delegated amount is only the place funding under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/regulation/14/made" rel="external">Regulation 14 of the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021</a>. Top-up funding should appear in section 1.2 of the form.</p>

<p>Funding for nursery places funded from the high needs block should also be included.</p>

<p>Do not include place funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>FE colleges</li>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>independent colleges</li>
  <li>special post-16 institutions and other post-16 providers that do not provide for pupils of compulsory school age</li>
  <li>maintained schools and academies that provide only for 16 to 19-year-olds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lines 1.0.1 and 1.0.2</h3>

<p>The total of these 2 lines will be the equivalent of the single line 1.0.1 before 2018 to 2019.</p>

<p>Total ISB must be consistent with figures recorded in the authority proforma tool (APT) and accompanying tables submitted to ESFA in January, and will include the following when populated in the workbook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years column: the total early years single funding formula including PVIs, maintained nursery schools and nursery classes, special educational needs inclusion fund top-up grant, early years pupil premium and disability access fund</li>
  <li>primary column: total budget share including all primary minimum funding guarantee with the early years element removed</li>
  <li>secondary column: total budget share, including sixth forms and including all secondary minimum funding guarantee with the early years element removed</li>
  <li>special schools column: total budget share, including sixth forms (the high needs place funding)</li>
  <li>alternative provision/pupil referral units column: total budget share (for example, the high needs place funding)</li>
</ul>

<h3>De-delegated Items</h3>

<p>These apply only to maintained primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h4>Contingencies (1.1.1)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure as defined in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/contents/made" rel="external">Part 1 of the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021.</a> This ‘expenditure on the schools specific contingency’ is central expenditure deducted for the purpose of ensuring that monies are available to enable increases in a school’s budget share after it has been allocated, and where a governing body has incurred expenditure where it would be unreasonable to expect it to meet this from the school’s budget share.</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools in financial difficulty</li>
  <li>the writing-off of deficits of schools which are discontinued, excluding any associated costs and overheads</li>

<h4>School improvement (1.1.10)</h4>

<p>School improvement de-delegation covers any additional school improvement activities provided for maintained schools by the local authority that are not included within the scope of the separate local authority grant for school intervention and improvement (see line 2.0.3). The grant covers activities in relation to intervening in underperforming maintained schools, monitoring maintained schools in order to identify those at risk of becoming eligible for intervention and the commissioning of support for them.</p>

<h3>High needs budget</h3>

<h4>Top-up funding: maintained schools (1.2.1)</h4>

<p>Include planned expenditure on top-up funding for maintained schools, including pupil referral units (PRUs).</p>

<p>Top-up funding is paid to schools for pupils with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream classes</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream schools</li>
  <li>special schools</li>
  <li>PRUs</li>
  <li>sixth forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Top-up funding is usually administered directly by local authorities from a central high needs budget. Where such funding has been devolved to groups of schools or individual schools for them to decide what to pay other schools (for example, when a school pays top-up funding for a pupil it places in a PRU), this funding should also be included. It is important, however, that this excludes any funding already in schools’ budget shares and included in line 1.0.1.</p>

<p>This line should also include any high needs funding paid to maintained special schools and PRUs for teachers’ pay and pensions (employer contributions) costs, under the additional condition of grant attached to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022#grant-allocation-and-payment">local authorities’ DSG (section 3.6(7)</a>).</p>

<h4>Top-up funding: academies, free schools and colleges (1.2.2)</h4>

<p>Include planned expenditure on top-up funding for academies and free schools. Top-up funding is paid to academies for pupils with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mainstream classes</li>
  <li>special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream academies and free schools</li>
  <li>special academies and free schools</li>
  <li>alternative provision academies and free schools</li>
  <li>academy and free school sixth forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Also include, in the ‘post-school’ column, top-up funding for students with high needs in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>further education colleges</li>
  <li>sixth form colleges</li>
  <li>16 to 19 schools and academies without pupils of compulsory school age</li>
  <li>local authority post-16 provision</li>
</ul>

<p>Top-up funding is usually administered directly by local authorities from a central high needs budget. Where such funding has been devolved to schools and academies for them to decide what to pay other schools (for example, when an academy pays top-up funding for a pupil it places in an alternative provision free school), this funding should also be included. It is important, however, that this excludes any funding already in academies’ budget shares and included in line 1.0.1.</p>

<p>This line should also include any high needs funding paid to special academies and free schools, and to AP academies and free schools, for teachers’ pay and pensions (employer contributions) costs, under the additional condition of grant attached to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022#grant-allocation-and-payment">local authorities’ DSG (section 3.6(7)</a>).</p>

<h4>Top-up and other funding: non-maintained and independent providers (1.2.3)</h4>

<p>Include planned expenditure on top-up funding for non-maintained special schools in the special schools column.</p>

<p>Planned expenditure on pupils with education, health and care (EHC) plans at independent special schools, including pupils in their sixth forms, should be included in the special school column.</p>

<p>Planned expenditure on mainstream independent schools should be recorded in the primary or secondary columns, as for mainstream maintained schools and academies.</p>

<p>In the post-school column include planned expenditure on top-up funding for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students at independent learning providers of post-16 education and training (previously called commercial and charitable providers)</li>
  <li>independent specialist colleges</li>
  <li>other independent special post-16 institutions</li>
</ul>

<p>While independent and non-maintained provision frequently offers integrated education, health and social care provision, only educational costs should be charged to the DSG. The social care element of accommodating children with special educational needs in schools should be recorded elsewhere (for example, 3.1.1). In the event that health costs are recorded here (for example, paid up-front as part of an integrated package of support), they should be recorded with associated health income.</p>

<h4>Additional high needs targeted funding for mainstream schools and academies (1.2.4)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure from the local authority’s high needs budget which is given to mainstream schools and academies (and exceptionally colleges) to ensure they have enough funding to meet additional support costs up to £6,000 for pupils with SEN, where they cannot reasonably do this out of their budget share or other mainstream funding.</p>

<p>Local authorities were asked to give more detailed information in their APT return (including the amounts and criteria) about such targeted funding for mainstream schools. More information is available in the detailed <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-complete-the-authority-proforma-tool-apt">APT guidance.</a></p>

<h4>SEN support services (1.2.5)</h4>

<p>Include the costs of non-delegated centrally retained specialist SEN support services for pupils with EHC plans, whether supported directly by the local authority or commissioned by them. This will include services for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>visual, hearing and physical impairment</li>
  <li>specific learning difficulties</li>
  <li>speech</li>
  <li>language and communication</li>
  <li>profound and severe learning difficulties</li>
  <li>autism</li>
</ul>

<p>You should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the costs of these services for 0 to 5-year-olds</li>
  <li>any costs of providing these services to home educated children</li>
  <li>the costs of early years SENCOs who are centrally managed across a number of early years providers</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include the costs of behaviour support services which are not in support of SEN (see line 1.1.2).</p>

<p>Do not include recharges or the cost of monitoring SEN provision. This should be included in the ‘Other Education and Community Budget, 2.1.2 Monitoring of SEN provision’.</p>

<h4>Hospital education services (1.2.6)</h4>

<p>Hospital education is defined in the regulations as education provided at a community special school or foundation special school established in a hospital (usually called a hospital school), or under any arrangements made by the local authority under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 (normally provision in PRUs or services centrally managed by the local authority, where the child is being provided with such education by reason of a decision made by a medical practitioner).</p>

<p>In line 1.2.6 only include expenditure on hospital education services. It should include both services made available to children and young people resident in the local authority’s area, and services made available to those who are in the area because that is where they are receiving their health care. It should also include expenditure on the local authority’s pupils who are receiving their education from an independent hospital education provider.</p>

<p>It is important to exclude from this budget line any funding for hospital education places in special schools (including those special schools that are hospital schools) or PRUs (sometimes these are known as medical PRUs), which should instead be included in line 1.0.2 with a breakdown in table 2.</p>

<h4>Other alternative provision services (1.2.7)</h4>

<p>Include planned expenditure on AP services provided directly or commissioned by the local authority. This may include funding for home educating parents.</p>

<p>Also include funding for AP providers other than PRUs, AP academies and AP free schools. Include funding for commissioned services delivered by PRUs, AP academies and AP free schools.</p>

<p>Exclude any funding for high needs places at PRUs and AP academies (which should instead be included in line 1.0.2 and specified in table 2) and any top-up funding in respect of pupils at these providers (see lines 1.2.2 and 1.2.3).</p>

<p>Funding for places in AP free schools that is recouped from local authorities from the third year that the free school is open should be included in this line and in the academies recoupment line 1.10.2.</p>

<h4>Support for inclusion (1.2.8)</h4>

<p>Include here expenditure for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collaboration between mainstream and special schools and primary and secondary schools to enable children with special educational needs to take part in mainstream activities</li>
  <li>devolved expenditure for the integration of children from specialist to mainstream settings and the provision of discrete services or projects to promote such integration, such as commissioned outreach services</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include recharges or the cost of monitoring SEN provision. This should be included in the ‘Other Education and Community Budget, 2.1.2 Monitoring of SEN provision’.</p>

<h4>Special schools and PRUs in financial difficulty (1.2.9)</h4>
<p>Include expenditure on assisting special schools and PRUs in financial difficulty.</p>

<h4>PFI/BSF costs at special schools, AP/ PRUs and post-16 institutions only (1.2.10)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure on funding private finance initiative (PFI) or Building Schools for the Future (BSF) costs at special schools, special academies, AP/PRUs and AP academies, where the local authority has decided to fund this outside the place funding and top-up funding. 
This line should also be used for funding PFI or BSF costs at maintained 16 to 19 institutions and 16 to 19 academies, which can no longer be funded through the schools formula as the post-16 factor has been discontinued.</p>

<h4>Direct payments (SEN and disability) (1.2.11)</h4>
<p>Include all expenditure planned by the local authority under the SEN (Personal Budgets) Regulations 2014 to provide a direct payment to the parents of children, or to young people, with an education, health and care (EHC) plan.</p>

<p>Include here SEN transport expenditure where there have been direct payments made to families to cover these costs.</p>

<h4>Carbon reduction commitment allowances (PRUs) (1.2.12)</h4>

<p>Include the cost of the purchase of Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) allowances in relation to PRUs in the local authority area. PRUs, unlike other maintained schools and academies, remain part of the CRC scheme.</p>

<h4>Therapies and other health related services (1.2.13)</h4>

<p>Include costs associated with the provision or purchase of speech, physiotherapy and occupational therapies. Include any expenditure on the provision of special medical support for individual pupils which has been deemed to be special educational provision (for example, recorded under section F of an education, health and care plan) and therefore the responsibility of the local authority.</p>

<h3>Early years budget</h3>

<h4>Central expenditure on early years entitlement (1.3.1)</h4>

<p>This line should reflect the total funding for early years contingency and centrally retained spending for 2, 3 and 4-year-old entitlements from the early years proforma. The gross figure in line 1.3.1 in the local authority table should match the total sum of early years proforma lines 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b.</p>

<h3>Central provision within schools budget</h3>

<p>The finance regulations restrict a number of central schools block lines to historic commitments entered into prior to 1 April 2013. The budget for these cannot increase over the budget held in 2012 to 2013. The relevant expenditure lines are 1.4.1, 1.4.4, 1.4.6, 1.4.7 and 1.4.11.</p>

<p>These regulations state that ‘expenditure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of part 1 (Historic Commitments) of schedule 2 may only be deducted by the local authority where the expenditure is to be incurred as a result of decisions taken before 1 April 2013 that commit the authority to incur expenditure in the funding period.’</p>

<p>The ‘funding period’ here refers to the forthcoming financial year.</p>

<p>Schedule 2 also states that, other than in the case of paragraph 1 (capital expenditure funded from revenue), the schools forum or the Secretary of State must have approved the original decision. Schedule 2 does not allow local authorities to maintain a budget of indefinite size for an indefinite period against these funding lines.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-funding-arrangements-2017-to-2018">2017 to 2018 schools funding historic commitments guidance.</a></p>

<h4>Contribution to combined budgets (1.4.1)</h4>

<p>Expenditure under this heading should only reflect the contribution to a combined service approved by the schools forum. The service must be partly funded from outside the schools budget and there should be an educational benefit arising from the service. These require annual authorisation as stated in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">paragraph 2 (c) of Schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021.</a></p>

<p>Also include expenditure on miscellaneous purposes, provided the expenditure does not amount to more than 0.1% of the local authority’s schools budget and was approved by the schools forum or Secretary of State before 1 April 2013 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">(paragraph 2(e) of Schedule 2).</a></p>

<h4>School admissions (1.4.2)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure incurred in connection with the local authority’s functions under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/46" rel="external">section 85A of the 1998 Act (as inserted by s46 2002 Act).</a> This includes the administration of the system of admissions of pupils to schools including expenditure incurred:</p>

<ul>
  <li>carrying out consultations under section 88C (2) of the 1998 Act, establishing, maintaining and consulting with representative bodies for the purposes of admissions</li>
  <li>in relation to appeals</li>
</ul>

<h4>Servicing of schools forums (1.4.3)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure incurred in connection with the local authority’s functions of running the forum as defined under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/46" rel="external">section 47A of the 1998 Act (addition under Section 43 of Education Act 2002)</a> (establishment, maintenance of, and consultation with schools forums).</p>

<h4>Termination of employment costs (1.4.4)</h4>

<p>Only include expenditure in respect of premature retirement costs, or for the purposes of securing the resignation of any person employed in a maintained school where there are consequential savings to the schools budget and where the cost relating to that individual had been approved by the schools forum prior to 1 April 2013 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">(paragraph 2 (b) of Schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021).</a></p>

<p>It does not count as a commitment to have identified a budget for different individuals’ costs each year or to support new redundancy costs in schools.</p>

<h4>Falling rolls fund (1.4.5)</h4>

<p>Expenditure to be incurred due to a decline in pupil numbers in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>schools which were awarded either the highest or the second highest grade in their last inspection under section 5 of the 2005 act, including those inspected during the funding period</li>
  <li>academy schools that have not previously been inspected under section 5 of the 2005 act and have a predecessor school (or schools) awarded the highest or second highest grade in their last inspection under section 5 of the 2005 act, including those inspected during the funding period</li>
</ul>

<p>Where funding is likely to be necessary due to subsequent growth in pupil numbers at such schools before the end of the next 3 financial years after the funding period 2021 to 2022.</p>

<h4>Capital expenditure from revenue (CERA) (1.4.6)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure commonly known as CERA (capital expenditure which an authority expects to charge to a revenue account of the authority within the meaning of section 22 of the Local Government Act 2003) and where the expenditure relating to the specific project had been approved prior to 1 April 2013.</p>

<p>It does not count as a commitment to have identified a budget for different capital works each year or a general contribution to the capital programme. PFI costs should be delegated through the funding formula.</p>

<h4>Prudential borrowing costs (1.4.7)</h4>

<p>Enter expenditure incurred in repayment of loans under <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">paragraph 2(a) of Schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021.</a></p>

<p>PFI costs should be delegated through the funding formula.</p>

<h4>Fees to independent schools without SEN (1.4.8)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure pursuant to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/section/18" rel="external">section 18 of the 1996 act</a> in making any grant or other payment in respect of fees or expenses (of whatever nature) which are payable in connection with the attendance of pupils without SEN at a school which is not maintained by any local authority and is not an academy.</p>

<p>This does not include fees to independent schools providing alternative provision (AP) or hospital education, or to independent AP institutions, which should be shown in lines 1.2.6 or 1.2.7 as appropriate.</p>

<p>Include planned expenditure on post-16 students without SEN in independent schools.</p>

<h4>Equal pay/back pay (1.4.9)</h4>

<p>Include centrally retained provision for meeting the cost of equal pay settlements in schools.</p>

<h4>Pupil growth (1.4.10)</h4>

<p>Include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>expenditure incurred due to a significant growth in pupil numbers as a result of the local authority’s duty under section 13(1) of the 1996 act to ensure that sufficient primary education and secondary education are available to meet the needs of the population in their area</li>
  <li>expenditure to be incurred prior to the opening of new schools to fund the appointment of staff and to enable the purchase of any goods and services necessary in order to admit pupils</li>
</ul>

<p>This includes pre and post-opening funding for new schools (including academies) built to meet basic need.</p>

<h4>SEN transport (1.4.11)</h4>

<p>Only include expenditure that has been offset by savings to the schools budget and has been approved by the schools forum <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">(paragraph 2(d) of Schedule 2 to the School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021)</a>.</p>

<h4>Exceptions agreed by the Secretary of State (1.4.12)</h4>

<p>Include centrally retained schools budget expenditure approved by the Secretary of State and falling outside the classes or descriptions of planned expenditure in <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/59/schedule/2/made" rel="external">Schedule 2 of the 2021 regulations.</a> Schools forum approval is required on an annual basis for historic or new commitments if it is to continue. This excludes expenditure on licences, which should be under 1.4.14.</p>

<h4>Infant class sizes (1.4.13)</h4>

<p>Include expenditure incurred in order to make provision for extra classes in compliance with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/10/contents/made" rel="external">School Admissions (Infant Class Sizes) (England) Regulations 2012</a>.</p>

<h3>Other items (1.4.14)</h3>

<p>Include expenditure on:</p>

<p>(a) Copyright licences which are negotiated centrally by the Secretary of State for all publicly funded schools: for 2021 to 2022 these are the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copyright Licensing Agency licence</li>
  <li>School Printed Music licence</li>
  <li>Newspaper Licensing Agency Schools licence</li>
  <li>Educational Recording Agency licence</li>
  <li>Public Video Screening licence</li>
  <li>Motion Picture Licensing Company licence</li>
  <li>Performing Rights Society licence</li>
  <li>Phonographic Performance licence</li>
  <li>Mechanical Copyright Protection Society licence</li>
  <li>Christian Copyright Licensing International licence</li>
</ul>

<p>(b) remission of boarding fees payable in connection with the attendance of pupils at maintained schools and academies.</p>

<p>(c) Any funding for additional costs covered from DSG arising from the increase in the employer’s contribution rate on 1 September 2019 for members of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme that are employed by the local authority and not employed to work in maintained schools, that does not fit within any other line of section 1.</p>

<p>The regulations (paragraph 24 of Schedule 2) allow authorities to charge to the schools budget 30.5% of the total employer contribution to the pension costs for such teachers. Many of these teachers’ salaries will be funded from the schools budget (eg in line 1.2.5) and in that case the full cost of the teacher should be entered in that line; but where the teacher’s salary would appear in section 2, or would not appear on this form at all, the chargeable pension cost contribution should appear in this line.</p>

<h3>Central provision within schools budget (former ESG retained duties)</h3>

<p>From 2017 to 2018 that part of the ESG which related to retained duties (those that apply to both maintained schools and academies) was added to the DSG. This provision now falls within the schools budget, provided it is funded out of DSG (see section 2.0 for provision not funded out of DSG). Additional lines have been provided in section 1 for the purpose of recording it.</p>

<h3>Central provision funded through maintained schools budget</h3>

<p>The general duties part of ESG (that part relating to maintained schools only) ceased from September 2017.</p>

<p>Local authorities will be able to deduct funding from maintained schools’ budgets (with the consent of maintained school members of the schools forum) in much the same way as for existing de-delegated items in order to fund these services. Provision funded in this way should be recorded in this section. For provision not funded from DSG see section 2.0.</p>

<h4>Premature retirement costs/redundancy costs (new provisions) (1.6.5)</h4>

<h4>Other specific grants (1.7.1)</h4>

<p>Include other specific grants, whether devolved or not devolved to schools.</p>

<p>Do not include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>any ring-fenced grants such as the DSG</li>
  <li>any element of the pupil premium grant (which should not be entered anywhere on the form)</li>
  <li>sixth form funding</li>
  <li>universal infant free school meals</li>
  <li>free school meal supplementary</li>
  <li>PE and sport funding</li>
  <li>year 7 catch-up funding</li>
  <li>any teachers’ pay or pension grant</li>
</ul>

<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) grants for schools should also be excluded.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Note that the early years pupil premium is part of the early years block budget and not part of the pupil premium grant and is to be included on the form under 1.0.1.</p>
</div>

<p>Where this line is used both the grant and the expenditure funded by the grant should be entered, so that the line nets to zero in all circumstances (local authorities should be planning to spend all of the grants, since grants cannot be used for any other purpose).</p>

<h4>Total schools budget (before academy recoupment) (1.8.1)</h4>

<p>Memorandum line 1.8.1a</p>

<p>Please enter the allocated DSG funding and planned spending for the 4 blocks shown on the local authority table.</p>

<p>Allocated DSG funding should be taken from the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://skillsfunding.service.gov.uk/view-latest-funding/national-funding-allocations/DSG/2021-to-2022" rel="external">tables of 2021 to 2022 DSG allocations</a> published by ESFA on 17 December 2020, after deductions for post-school high needs place funding, but before any recoupment for academies. The allocated block funding figures in the tables should not be altered for any transfers that the local authority may have made between blocks, or for any accruals in the early years sector.</p>

<p>Planned spending should be derived from the net spending entered in sections 1.0 to 1.6 of the table, appropriately assigned against the 4 DSG blocks. Where a transfer has been made between blocks, the spending will appear against the block where it will actually be spent (for example, high needs rather than schools). You should, however, ensure that all expenditure supported by the funding in line 1.9.4 (grant supporting post-16 education) is excluded from this table.</p>

<p>In general terms, we would expect that expenditure entered in the early years column would relate to the early years block. For the other columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>line 1.0.1, section 1.1, lines 1.4.5, 1.4.10 and 1.4.13, and section 1.6 would relate to the schools block</li>
  <li>line 1.0.2, section 1.2 and line 1.4.11 would relate to the high needs block</li>
  <li>the rest of section 1.4 along with section 1.5 would relate to the central school services block</li>
</ul>

<p>However, local authorities may have other ways of attributing expenditure, particularly for early years pupils with high needs, and so should assign expenditure in line with local practice.</p>

<p>Expenditure should include everything that has actually been budgeted for, regardless of whether the source of funding is the 2021 to 2022 DSG, funds brought forward from previous years, or a deficit to be carried forward to the following year.</p>

<h3>Reconciliation of schools budget (before academy recoupment)</h3>

<h4>Estimated dedicated schools grant for 2021 to 2022 (after deductions for post-school high needs place funding, but including school and academy post-16 high needs place funding) (1.9.1)</h4>

<p>The local authority’s estimated DSG for the purposes of setting the schools budget. This is DSG as notified in December 2020, including post-16 high needs place funding in maintained schools and academies, adjusted by the subsequent deductions from the high needs block of place funding for colleges and other post-school institutions which will be paid directly by ESFA, and by the local authority’s estimate of future changes in the early years block.</p>

<h4>Dedicated schools grant brought forward from 2020 to 2021 (1.9.2)</h4>

<p>The total amount of DSG reserves brought forward from previous years, as estimated at 31 March 2021. Reserves should be entered as a positive number and deficits as a negative number. These will result from carry forward from financial years before 2020 to 2021, plus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the difference between the final DSG in 2020 to 2021 and earlier estimates of DSG on which the schools budget was based</li>
  <li>an expected under or over spend in 2020 to 2021 against the central elements of the schools budget</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dedicated schools grant carry forward to 2022 to 2023 (negative or positive) (1.9.3)</h4>

<p>Any amount which the authority decided after consultation with the schools forum to carry forward to 2022 to 2023 from the 2021 to 2022 DSG, or from DSG carried over from earlier years, rather than distribute in 2021 to 2022. A negative number represents a positive sum being carried forward, and a positive number indicates a deficit being carried forward.</p>

<h4>Grant for maintained school sixth forms (1.9.4)</h4>

<p>Grant supporting post-16 education in maintained schools, including schools becoming academies on or after 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>If 2021 to 2022 data is not received in time, local authorities will need to forecast the income for 2021 to 2022 based upon the 2020 to 2021 figures and information about 2021 to 2022 arrangements issued by ESFA.</p>

<h4>Local authority additional contribution (1.9.5)</h4>

<p>This includes any additional funding provided by the local authority to support the schools budget. If the local authority has a DSG deficit as at the end of the financial year 2020 to 2021, a contribution from non-DSG sources requires the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

<h4>Total funding supporting the schools budget (lines 1.9.1 to 1.9.5) (1.9.6)</h4>

<p>This line records the total sources of income to the schools budget, taking into account balances brought forward from 2020 to 2021 and those it intends to carry forward to 2022 to 2023, as well as any additional funds provided by the local authority.</p>

<h4>Academy: recoupment from the dedicated schools grant, excluding the recoupment of high needs place funding shown in line 1.0.2 (1.10.1)</h4>

<p>Enter here any amount which the local authority expects to be recouped from its gross DSG allocation for 2021 to 2022 for academies. Exclude any high needs place funding for special and AP academies, and for special units and resourced provision in primary and secondary academies. These amounts should be included in line 1.10.2.</p>

<p>This line needs to include recoupment estimates for all academies which are funded by recoupment and which have become academies before 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>No recoupment estimates should be included for schools which are expected to become academies on or after 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>Recoupment from the DSG should be shown as a negative figure.</p>

<h4>Academy: recoupment from the dedicated schools grant of high needs place funding shown under line 1.0.2 (1.10.2)</h4>

<p>Enter here any high needs place funding amount which the local authority expects to be recouped from its gross DSG allocation for 2021 to 2022 for special and AP academies (including those in receipt of hospital education place funding), and for special units and resourced provision in primary and secondary academies.<br>
Do not include place funding for 16 to 19 academies and free schools, and FE colleges and independent learning providers.</p>

<p>Local authorities should use the recoupment figures from the March 2021 DSG publication, as these take account of the academic year changes following the annual place change notification process.</p>

<p>This line needs to include recoupment estimates for all academies which are funded by recoupment and which have become academies before 1 April 2021. Also add in any recoupment of place funding for AP free schools that is included in line 1.2.7 rather than line 1.0.2.</p>

<p>No recoupment estimates should be included for schools which are expected to become academies on or after 1 April 2021.</p>

<p>Recoupment from the DSG should be shown as a negative figure.</p>

<h3>Other education and community budget</h3>

<p>Subject to what is said below in relation to specific grants, administrative costs and overheads attributable to a particular category of expenditure should be included under the appropriate item head. Similar treatment will apply to expenditure in relation to support for IT systems.</p>

<p>The lines in section 2.0 relate to functions formerly funded from ESG. They should be used to record provision for those functions that are not funded from DSG in 2021 to 2022, and instead are funded from the local authority grant for school intervention and improvement, or other council sources of funding rather than from DSG. They are therefore not part of the schools budget.</p>

<h4>Central support services (2.0.1)</h4>

<p>Includes expenditure on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pupil support: provision and administration of clothing grants and board and lodging grants, where such expenditure is not supported by grant</li>
  <li>music services: expenditure on the provision of music tuition or other activities which provide opportunities for pupils to enhance their experience of music</li>
  <li>visual and performing arts (other than music): expenditure which enables pupils to enhance their experience of the visual, creative and performing arts other than music</li>
  <li>outdoor education including environmental and field studies (not sports): expenditure on outdoor education centres, field study and environmental studies and so on, but not including centres wholly or mainly for the provision of organised games, swimming or athletics</li>

<p>A memorandum line is an extraction of figures which have been included as planned expenditure in the lines above.</p>

<h3>Services for young people</h3>

<p>Planned expenditure on substance misuse services and teenage pregnancy services will already be included in lines 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 above, and should also be included as separate categories in the following lines. These lines are not included in the total spending figures to avoid double counting.</p>

<h2>High needs places table</h2>

<h3>Special schools/pupil referral units/hospital schools</h3>

<p>This table only collects data on maintained schools. The delegated budget for special schools and pupil referral units (PRUs) will consist of place funding only. The total place funding amounts should be included in line 1.0.2. The schools’ and PRUs’ top-up funding is shown in line 1.2.1.</p>

<p>Special school and other SEN places will receive £10,000 per place; AP places in PRUs and other settings will also receive £10,000 per place; and hospital education places will be funded on the same per place amount as in 2020 to 2021, unless the authority has decided to increase the amount. Funding for places that are intended for, or occupied by, 16 to 19-year-old pupils should be included. Nursery places in special schools should also be included.</p>

<p>Some institutions provide more than one of these types of education and the form therefore provides 3 columns that can be used for each institution. Local authorities should classify each institution under its formal designation as a special school, PRU or hospital school (a type of special school serving a hospital), which will normally indicate its predominant type of place.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note, the funding amount in the columns should be calculated by using the rate per place and multiplying it by the number of places. However, if the place numbers planned for April to August and September to March are different, then a pro rata calculation has to be carried out. Part year per place amounts should be calculated on a pro rata basis for five-twelfths and seven-twelfths respectively.</p>
</div>

<h3>Special units and resourced provision in mainstream schools</h3>

<p>A new section was added to this table from 2018 to 2019 for local authorities to show the number of places and total place funding for special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream nursery, primary and secondary schools. These are the amounts included within the schools’ delegated budgets.<br>
Include nursery places if they are funded from the local authority’s high needs budget. Include places for 16 to 19-year-olds in special units and resourced provision only. The total place funding amounts should be included within line 1.0.2. The schools’ top-up funding for pupils in the special units or resourced provision is shown in line 1.2.1.</p>

<p>Special units and resourced provision receive £6,000 per place for places occupied by pupils on the roll of the school and £10,000 per place for other places. The funding amount in the columns should be calculated by using the rates per place (£6,000 or £10,000) and multiplying those by the appropriate number of places. The total funded place numbers are determined locally for maintained schools or through the place change process for ESFA funded institutions. Information provided by local authorities through the APT is then used to inform the number of places funded at £6,000.</p>

<p>If the total place numbers planned for April to August and September to March are different, then a pro rata calculation has to be carried out. Part year per place amounts should be calculated on a pro rata basis for five-twelfths and seven-twelfths respectively.</p>

<h3>School name</h3>
<p>The names of all mainstream schools with special units/resourced provision, special schools, PRUs and hospital schools maintained by the authority before the start of the financial year will be pre-populated by DfE.  
Local authorities are able to add or remove schools where required.</p>

<h3>DfE number</h3>

<p>DfE will enter the school’s number opposite the name of each school.</p>

<h3>School or unit opening/closing</h3>

<p>The drop-down section allows you to indicate opposite the name of a school whether it (or its unit or resourced provision) is closing or opening during the financial year. There is the option to otherwise leave blank. If, for example, 2 schools were merging to form one new school, there would be 3 entries, 2 for each of the closing schools and one for the new school being opened.<br>
Full-year data should be provided for schools converting to become academies.</p>

<h3>Date opening/closing</h3>

<p>Enter the date that the maintained school or its unit is intended to close or open in the form dd/mm/yyyy.</p>

<h3>Places</h3>

<p>The number of places entered in the following columns should be the number of places to be funded in the academic year 2020 to 2021 (for the period April to August 2021), and to be funded in the academic year 2021 to 2022 (for the period September 2021 to March 2022). These are the full-year place numbers and are not to be pro-rated for the part of the year that falls in the 2021 to 2022 financial year. Where there are changes to the place numbers between academic years, in calculating the total funding for the financial year multiply the annual place number for each academic year by the appropriate place value calculated using the five-twelfths plus seven-twelfths split.</p>

<h3>Special educational needs (SEN) places</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to August 2021</h4>

<h4>September 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>Include the number of places for pupils with EHC plans, funded at £10,000 per place per annum. In special units or resourced provision attached to mainstream schools, the funding per place is either £6,000 or £10,000 per place per annum.</p>

<h4>SEN place funding April 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>This is the total cost of the places in the previous columns. For all places except those in special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream schools, this should be £10,000 multiplied by the number of places in the previous columns. The only exception is where the place amount is reduced because the school is opening or closing during the financial year. When the place numbers change in September 2021, multiply the place number for the period April to August 2021 by £4,167 (five-twelfths of £10,000), and the place number for the period September 2021 to March 2022 by £5,833 (seven-twelfths of £10,000) to get the total for the financial year April 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<p>For places in special units and resourced provision attached to mainstream schools, the total cost of the places should be £6,000 multiplied by the number of places funded at that rate, and £10,000 multiplied by the number of places funded at that rate. The only exception is where the place amount is reduced because the unit or resourced provision is opening or closing during the financial year. When the place numbers change in September 2021, multiply the place number for the period April to August 2021 by £2,500 (five-twelfths of £6,000) or £4,167 (five-twelfths of £10,000), and the place number for the period September 2021 to March 2022 by £3,500 (seven-twelfths of £6,000) or £5,833 (seven-twelfths of £10,000) to get the total for the financial year April 2021 to March 2022.</p>

<h3>Alternative provision (AP) places</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to August 2021</h4>

<h4>September 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>Include the number of places to provide alternative provision for pupils at £10,000 per place per annum.</p>

<h3>AP place funding</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>This is the total cost of the places in the previous columns. Multiply the place number for the period April to August 2021 by £4,167 (five-twelfths of £10,000), and the place number for the period September 2021 to March 2022 by £5,833 (seven-twelfths of £10,000) to get the total for the financial year April 2021 to March 2022. The only exception to this calculation is where the place amounts are reduced because the school is opening or closing during the financial year.</p>

<h3>Hospital education places</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to August 2021</h4>

<h4>September 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>Hospital education places must be funded at the same per place amount as in 2020 to 2021, unless the authority has decided to increase the amount. Hospital education is defined as where the child is being provided with such education by reason of a decision made by a medical practitioner (as opposed to by an educationalist).</p>

<p>The funding for the number of hospital education places in special schools (including so-called hospital schools) or PRUs (sometimes known as medical PRUs) is the amount which must be included in line 1.0.2. It should exclude expenditure on hospital education services that are not funded as places at these providers, which should instead be included in line 1.2.6. Please note that there should be no duplication of hospital education place funding included in table 2 and the amounts in line 1.2.6 of the local authority table, as the place funding should be included in line 1.0.2.</p>

<p>Where appropriate the funding for hospital education places should also include any high needs funding paid to maintained special schools and PRUs providing hospital education, for teachers’ pay and pensions (employer contributions) costs, under the additional condition of grant attached to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dedicated-schools-grant-dsg-2021-to-2022/dsg-conditions-of-grant-2021-to-2022#grant-allocation-and-payment">local authorities’ DSG (section 3.6(7)</a>).</p>

<h3>Hospital education place funding</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>Total cost of the places in the previous column. This should be the amount per place (including the appropriate amount of additional high needs funding for teachers’ ay and pensions costs, as above) multiplied by the number of places in the previous columns. See above for how to work out the amount for the financial year April 2021 to March 2022 if the place number changes in September 2021.</p>

<h3>Total Place funding net</h3>

<h4>April 2021 to March 2022</h4>

<p>Total place funding for the institution (the sum of the columns for SEN place funding, AP place funding and hospital education place funding).</p>

<h3>Total special schools</h3>

<p>Formulae in the boxes in each of the columns will automatically calculate the aggregate of the numbers entered in each of those columns in respect of special schools.</p>

<h3>Total pupil referral units</h3>

<p>Formulae in the boxes in each of the columns will automatically calculate the aggregate of the numbers entered in each of those columns, in respect of pupil referral units.</p>

<h3>Total hospital schools</h3>

<p>Formulae in the boxes in each of the columns will automatically calculate the aggregates of the numbers entered in each of those columns in respect of hospital schools.</p>

<h3>Total special units and resourced provision in mainstream schools</h3>

<p>Formulae in the boxes in each of the columns will automatically calculate the aggregates of the numbers entered in each of those columns in respect of special units and resourced provision in mainstream primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h2>The early years collection and the proforma</h2>

<p>This section of the return is designated to record the total local authority DSG spending on early years, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the universal 15 hours entitlement for disadvantaged 2, 3 and 4-year-olds</li>
  <li>the additional 15 hours for eligible working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds</li>
  <li>any budget allocated for the early years special educational needs inclusion fund</li>
  <li>the early years pupil premium</li>
  <li>the disability access fund</li>
  <li>any other DSG expenditure on early years</li>
</ul>

<p>The planned budget information from section 251 will be used to monitor compliance with all <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/early-years-funding-changes-to-funding-for-3-and-4-year-olds">the reforms to early years as announced in December 2016</a>.</p>

<p>Further details about the funding reforms is available in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/718181/Early_years_entitlements-operational_guidance.pdf" rel="external">early years entitlements operational guide for local authorities</a>.</p>

<p>The early years entitlement information recorded on COLLECT will be output into the early years proforma. The proforma is split into the:</p>

<ul>
  <li>early years single funding formula (EYSFF) for 3 and 4-year-olds (for both the universal 15 hours and additional 15 hours)</li>
  <li>EYSFF for 2-year-olds</li>
  <li>special educational needs inclusion fund (SENIF) top-up grant</li>
  <li>contingency and centrally retained spending</li>
  <li>early years pupil premium</li>
  <li>disability access fund</li>
</ul>

<p>Each section on EYSFF and SEN inclusion fund top-up grant is also split into provider types, giving data for maintained nursery schools, nursery classes and PVI settings.</p>

<p>DfE may use a small number of section 251 data items (to calculate the local authority’s central and contingency budget percentage) to determine the DSG funding allocation for supplementary funding for maintained nursery schools. Therefore, it is very important to ensure your planned budget information is completed accurately as any errors cannot be rectified after the section 251 data is finalised.</p>

<p>DfE will publish the early years proforma for each local authority as part of the early years benchmarking information later in the year.</p>

<p>The proforma will make publicly accessible more detailed information on local authorities’ funding for early years. The proforma is intended to increase transparency in local authority funding decisions and enable providers and others to make comparisons between different areas. When completing the return, please provide a comprehensive breakdown as far as possible on base rates, supplements, hours above universal/additional 15 hours and central spend activities. This will enable local authorities, providers and DfE to better understand how local authorities are using their early years budgets.</p>

<h3>Pass-through rate for 3 and 4-year-old entitlements</h3>

<p>All local authorities are required to pass-through at least 95% of their 3 and 4-year-old funding from the government to early years providers.</p>

<p>We have included a field at the start of the early years proforma report to show your pass-through rate as you plan your budget. This row is calculated automatically so you can determine compliance and adjust your budget accordingly if needed. You can view the calculated pass-through rate when you download the early years proforma table report in COLLECT.</p>

<p>To be compliant, the calculated pass-through rate must be at least 95.0% or more. That is, rounding up 94.9% will not be considered as meeting the requirement. The pass-through rate will be shown to one decimal place in the early years proforma.</p>

<p>The pass-through rate will be published when we publish the early years proforma.</p>

<p>Further details on how this is calculated is included in the early years entitlements operational guide.</p>

<h3>Early years single funding formula (3 and 4-year-olds) base rates per hour by provider type</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In the description, please state your base rates for provider types you are delivering funded places through for 3 and 4-year-olds. Please note all local authorities must use a universal base rate of funding for all providers.</p>

<h4>Unit value</h4>

<p>The amount entered for base rates must be an hourly rate. The unit value column is not fixed to hourly rate in COLLECT, therefore please make sure only the ‘per hour’ unit is entered.</p>

<h4>Number of units</h4>

<p>This is the total number of hours you expect to fund in the financial year. This has been split for the universal 15 hours and the additional 15 hours for base rate only (we do not require the number of units to be split between universal and additional 15 hours for the other formula factors). Whilst you should use the same hourly rate (unit value) for universal and additional 15 hours, you need to record the planned government entitlement hours to be delivered separately.</p>

<p>Please note, the total number of hours (for universal 15 hours and additional 15 hours) in the base line rate will be used for calculating the 95% pass-through funding to providers. 
The unit value and the number of units is split by provider types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PVI: include budget for private, voluntary and independent early years providers here, including childminders and academies</li>
  <li>nursery school: include budget for maintained nursery schools (MNS) here which is defined in Section 22(9) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, as a nursery school which is maintained by a local education authority and is not a special school (a maintained nursery school is a school which is wholly or mainly used for the education of children aged 2 and over but under compulsory school age)</li>
  <li>primary nursery class: include the budget here for maintained primary or secondary schools with nursery classes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supplements</h3>

<p>Please provide, in written format, a short explanation of your supplement payments.</p>

<p>We expect local authorities to fund their providers in the same way for both the universal 15 hours and additional 15 hours for working parents, and not to distinguish between the two. This means you should use the same base rate and same supplements for both entitlements. For the early years proforma, we do not expect you to record the ‘number of units’ for supplements separately for universal and additional 15 hours.</p>

<p>You can include the combined total ‘number of units’ for both sets of hours (we only need the hours recorded separately for the base rate).</p>

<p>We have included the mandatory supplement of deprivation for 3 and 4-year-olds and other permitted discretionary early years supplements (quality, flexibility, rurality/sparsity and English as additional language) in the proforma. Please note the quality supplement should only relate to funding to support workforce qualifications and/or system leadership.</p>

<p>If you do not use the other permitted supplements, please leave the relevant rows blank. If your EYSFF uses a lump sum factor for maintained nursery schools, please enter in the maintained nursery school (MNS) lump sums funding section (see below, line 3 of the early years table).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In the description, please state what the qualifying criteria are for each of your different supplements. Please include all supplements for each of the factors (adding more lines if necessary).</p>

<p>For example, if you have a quality supplement for recognising workforce qualifications or system leadership, and they are different for maintained and PVI provision, please use separate rows for each, with a brief summary of what they are paid for. The proforma is intended to be standalone, so descriptions of supplements should not make reference to other information not contained in the proforma (such as ‘same as school formula factors’).</p>

<h4>Amount and unit</h4>

<p>In the amount column please record the funding paid to providers and whether this amount is per hour, per child or a lump sum.</p>

<h4>Percentage of funding provided through supplements</h4>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note, under the early years funding reforms, the total value of supplements used must not be more than 10.0% of the total value of planned funding to be passed through to providers for delivering the government entitlement hours.</p>
</div>

<p>This row is calculated automatically so you can determine compliance on the 10% supplement funding cap. To be compliant, the funding provided through supplements cannot be more than 10%. That is, rounding down 10.4% will not be considered as meeting the requirement. The supplements funding percentage will be shown to 1 decimal place in the early years proforma. You can view the calculated supplements percentage when you download the ‘EY proforma table’ report in COLLECT.</p>

<p>Further details on how this is calculated is included in the early years entitlements operational guide.</p>

<h3>Maintained nursery school (MNS) lump sums (if applicable)</h3>

<p>This column is only for maintained nursery schools. If your EYSFF uses a lump sum factor for maintained nursery schools, this should be included here. If you do not have additional lump sum budgets for MNSs, please leave this section blank.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Please provide a brief description of what the MNS lump sums are paid for, adding separate rows if necessary. 
Amount and unit</p>

<p>In the amount column please record the funding paid to MNSs and whether this amount is per hour, per child, or a lump sum.</p>

<h3>Hours above universal/additional 15 hours (if applicable)</h3>

<p>This column is only for any extra hours that local authorities choose to fund in addition to the government’s 3 and 4-year-old entitlement hours.</p>

<p>Please record the number of hours which are funded over and above the universal/additional 15 hours entitlement for all settings (including maintained and PVIs), making sure to record for the different types of settings in separate lines.</p>

<p>This budget (line 4 of the early years table) will not be counted within the high pass-through rate funding calculation.</p>

<p>Technically, although hours above universal/additional 15 hours for PVI settings are classified as centrally retained funding, for the purposes of this data collection, you should record extra local hours for PVI settings here. In the early years proforma, the extra local hours for PVIs will be shown in the centrally retained spending section for accounting purposes.</p>

<h4>Total funding for early years single funding formula (3 and 4-year-old)</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>

<h3>Early years single funding formula (2-year-old) base rates per hour by provider type</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In the description, please state your base rates for the provider types you are delivering funded places through for 2-year-olds.</p>

<h4>Amount and unit</h4>

<p>Please record here the total number of hours you expect to fund in the financial year for 2-year-olds, split by provider type. The unit value entered for base rates must be an hourly rate. The unit value column is not fixed to hourly rate in COLLECT, therefore please make sure only the ‘per hour’ unit is entered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">2-year-old </span> supplements</h3>

<p>Please provide a short explanation of your supplement payments.</p>

<p>If you do not use supplements for 2-year-olds, leave the relevant rows blank.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In the description, please specify what each of the different supplements are paid for. Please include all supplements for each of the factors, including what the qualifying criteria are for each of your different supplements (adding more lines if necessary). For example, if the supplements differ for different providers, use separate rows for each provider with a brief description of what they are paid for.</p>

<h4>Amount and unit</h4>

<p>The amount for supplements can either be an hourly rate, a rate per child or a lump sum. In the amount column, please record the funding paid to providers and in the unit column, use the drop-down box to select whether this amount is per hour, per child or a lump sum.</p>

<h4>Total funding for early years single funding formula (2-year-olds)</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>

<h3>Special educational needs (SEN) inclusion fund (top-up grant element)</h3>

<p>All local authorities are required to establish an SEN inclusion fund for 3 and 4-year-olds. For 2-year-olds this is not a requirement, but local authorities may wish to use a similar system. The SEN inclusion fund is to resource and support the needs of individual children with low-level special educational needs.</p>

<p>The SEN inclusion fund can be used in the form of top-up grants to fund providers for supporting children with SEN; or used to support specialist local authority SEN services in the local area.</p>

<p>This column should only be used to record the top-up grant element of SEN inclusion funds paid to providers.<br>
Please note, only the top-up grant element of the SEN inclusion fund will be considered within the high pass-through rate. Therefore, only include the planned budget for the top-up grant element here. Also, since the high pass-through rate only applies to 3 and 4-year-olds, only the 3 and 4-year-olds SEN inclusion fund top-up grant will be considered for the pass-through calculation. If you plan to use any of the SEN inclusion fund for providing in-kind SEN specialist support to providers, this should be budgeted under central spend (line 9 of the early years table).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>SEN inclusion fund should be recorded separately for 3 and 4-year-olds and 2-year-olds, with a description of what the qualifying criteria are for your local SEN inclusion fund, adding additional rows for different criteria if necessary.</p>

<h4>Amount</h4>

<p>In the amount column please record the planned budget for the SEN inclusion fund top-up grant to providers, split by provider type. Since local authorities can pool funding from either or both of their early years and high needs DSG funding blocks, please provide a breakdown of the amount set aside for the SEN inclusion fund from the 2 funding blocks – separate rows are included in early years table line 7 to record the amounts allocated from the different blocks.</p>

<p>The budget (line 7a of the early years table) for 3 and 4-year-olds only will be counted within the high pass-through rate funding calculation.</p>

<h4>Total funding for SEN inclusion fund (top-up grant element)</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>

<h3>Early years contingency funding</h3>

<p>Please briefly explain what you include in contingency funding for 2, 3 and 4-year-olds and the amounts allocated to it. Contingency funding should be recorded separately for 2-year-olds and 3 and 4-year-olds, with a comprehensive breakdown as far as possible on what the contingency funding is intended to cover (add more lines if necessary).</p>

<p>This expenditure will also need to be included in line 1.3.1: ‘central expenditure on early years entitlement’.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Please note, contingency funding for 3 and 4-year-olds will be counted within the high pass-through rate for providers.</p>
</div>

<h3>Early years centrally retained funding</h3>

<p>This is intended to help providers and others understand how centrally retained funding is used by local authorities. This information will produce a national picture on how central early years spend is being used to help improve government-funded early education and support child development. Please briefly explain what elements are included in centrally retained spending and the amounts allocated to each of these.</p>

<p>If any of the SEN inclusion fund is used to provide in-kind specialist support for providers (for example, early years speech and language therapy services), that funding should be recorded here. Please add separate lines to record the support element of the SEN inclusion fund in the central spend budget line (rather than as a lump sum total in centrally retained spend).</p>

<p>Local authorities are required to secure schools forum approval for early years centrally retained spend, and the proforma could usefully include a headline summary of information made available to schools forums to secure this approval.</p>

<p>The proforma will display hours above universal/additional 15 hours in PVIs here, as these are technically centrally retained spending, but on COLLECT, these should be recorded in the hours above universal/additional 15 hours budget line (line 4) along with that for maintained provision.</p>

<p>Centrally retained funding should be recorded separately for 2-year-olds and 3 and 4-year-olds, with a comprehensive breakdown as far as possible on what the funding is intended to cover (add more lines if necessary).</p>

<h4>Total funding for early years central expenditure</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>

<p>This expenditure will also need to be included in line 1.3.1 – ‘Central expenditure on children under 5’ in the local authority table.</p>

<p>The total early years centrally retained spending in section 8 and 9 of the early years table should match line 1.3.1 gross in the local authority table.</p>

<h3>Early years pupil premium</h3>

<p>Please record your budget allocation for the early years pupil premium (EYPP) for 3 and 4-year-olds here. Information relating to how allocation for EYPP is split by provider type is not required.</p>

<p>Please note, that this should be recorded separately from all other early years spend and should be recorded separately from information relating to the deprivation supplement.</p>

<h4>Total funding for early years pupil premium</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>

<h3>Disability access fund</h3>

<p>Please record your budget allocation for the disability access fund (DAF) for 3 and 4-year-olds here. You will only need to record your total planned budget for DAF. Information relating to how allocation for DAF is split by provider type is not required.</p>

<h4>Total funding for early years disability access fund</h4>

<p>This row is calculated automatically.</p>
