<p>This information is provided to help British nationals overseas make decisions about whether and how to seek medical advice and attention; report to local police; and engage with foreign legal authorities following a rape or other form of sexual assault overseas.</p>

<p>For information on support available in the UK, see <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK.</a></p>

<h2>First steps</h2>
<p>It is your choice about what you do next, but this information may help you in coming to a decision. The most important thing is to make sure that you are as safe as you can be. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact the local emergency number. This may vary from province to province and from city to city. However, in most provinces you can dial 911 for emergency services or 144 for advice and support</li>
  <li>contact your tour operator if you are travelling with one</li>
  <li>contact the <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-buenos-aires">British Embassy in Buenos Aires</a> on +54 11 4808 2200. We will help you where we can, and can provide information on local police and medical procedures. Anything you tell us will be treated in the strictest confidence. We can contact your family or friends for you if you wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in Argentina</h2>

<p>If you have a tour operator, they should be able to arrange for someone to support you. If you do not have a tour operator, you can contact us and we can try to send a consular officer to support you. Please bear in mind that distances and staffing may limit our possibility of doing so. If you approach the police directly, you can also ask them to inform us.</p>

<p>If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, think about taking those you were wearing to the police. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or texts.</p>

<p>Tell the police if you think you have been drugged.</p>

<p>There may not always be both male and female police officers available, but we can express your preference to the authorities.</p>

<p>Ask for a copy of  the police report and for the details of the Prosecution Office or Court on duty to which the report will be forwarded too. This will allow you to follow up on the case later on.</p>

<p>There may not always be English-speaking officers available. If this were the case, we will do our best to make sure the authorities involve a translator as soon as possible. We will also provide you with a list of local translators and help you arrange their services if required.</p>

<p>If this is what you prefer, we can try to arrange to come to the police station with you. However, issues like distance or staffing may limit our possibilities to do so.</p>

<p>Local authorities may retain passports of suspects in a criminal investigation. As a victim of crime, you should not be requested to surrender your passport.</p>

<h2>What happens next?</h2>

<p>If you wish to report the crime to the police, they will ask you to give as many details of the incident as possible, including a description of the attacker(s). They will ask to keep any clothes, which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner, as well as any other belonging that may provide useful information on the attacker(s). The police will also take you to the local hospital for a forensic examination if this has not occurred yet.</p>

<p>After you have given your statement to the police, the report will be forwarded to the court or prosecution office on duty. You will be required to ratify your report in front of the Judge or Prosecutor in order to initiate the legal proceedings against the perpetrator, which means you may need to explain the course of the events one more time.</p>

<h2>If you do not want to report the incident to the police in Argentina</h2>

<p>We can  help you make arrangements to contact your insurance company, your family, travel back to the UK and/or provide you with information on local support in the UK. We can also  provide you with lists of English-speaking medical facilities, lawyers and translators.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a tour operator, you can report the incident to your representative and ask them for assistance. Where possible and if you wish, the tour operator may accompany you to the police and to the local hospital. Otherwise depending on your circumstances consular staff may be able to do so depending on distance and availability.</p>

<p>It is your choice on whether to report the crime, but if you don’t report it, your case may not be investigated if there is a lack of forensic evidence.</p>

<p>If you are 18 years old or over, the local authorities will only be able to investigate the rape or sexual assault if the report comes from you directly. The only exception to this rule is if you have a legal guardian or representative, who are entitled to report the offence on your behalf.</p>

<p>In the case of minors, anyone with concerns about a child being at risk or being a victim of abuse is entitled to report it to the authorities. This includes the professional doctor in charge who must report the suspicion immediately.</p>

<p>The time limit to report the crime with the authorities will depend on the offence committed. The maximum penalty set by the Argentine law for the crime committed will determine the time limit to report the crime to the authorities. If a sexual assault is punished by a maximum penalty of 4 years, the report will need to be made within the 4 years following the offence. However, the sooner you report it, the easier for the authorities to investigate the crime.</p>

<p>There are cases where - even for adult victims - the hospital has the legal duty to report the crime to the police without the victim’s consent. These include situations where the victim’s life is at imminent risk or the victim’s injuries are considered serious by local law.</p>

<p>Criminal offences committed in Argentina can only be reported in Argentina. A legal representative can file a report on your behalf if you live abroad.</p>

<p>In Argentina there is a national protocol in place to assist victims of rape and sexual assault. This protocol states that the victim’s right to access medical attention and professional support prevails even when the (adult) victim decides not to report the crime.</p>

<h2>If you want to report the incident to the police in the UK</h2>

<p>It is possible to report the crime to police in the UK. However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction. UK police forces cannot investigate crimes committed overseas. Foreign police forces can decide to request assistance from the UK police, but this cannot be guaranteed and is a very lengthy process.</p>

<p>It can therefore be very difficult to guarantee that any justice can be accessed without reporting the crime locally. Please see <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">rape and sexual assault: returning to the UK</a> after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information.</p>

<h2>The medical examination – what to expect</h2>

<p>In line with the National Protocol for Rape and Sexual Assault Victims, all hospitals and medical centres must treat victims of rape and sexual assault. All public hospitals in Argentina will do this free of charge.</p>

<p>You do not have to have a medical examination if you do not want to. It is your right to decide if you want this to happen or not, and it is the doctor’s duty to ask for your consent before the examination takes place. Doctors must be prepared to explain to you what this examination entails. The sooner the examination takes place, the more chance of collecting.</p>

<p>On arrival to the hospital, you will need to admit yourself at the “Guardia” – A&amp;E equivalent-. You may be asked to explain what is the nature of your emergency to ensure the relevant specialists come to see you.</p>

<p>If you have reported the incident to the police, they will usually take you to a public hospital and a forensic doctor will be called in immediately to carry out a forensic examination together with the hospital staff.</p>

<p>If you haven’t decided whether to involve the police, it is most likely that the medical examination will be carried out by trained hospital staff instead of a forensic doctor, and every sample collected and test results will show in your medical record at the hospital for future reference. They will not automatically report the results of any examination to the police.</p>

<p>In both cases, they will take samples, such as swabs, depending on the information you provide on the assault. They will also take blood samples -sometimes urine samples too-, and also retain some clothing and other items.  If this is what you prefer, we can try to arrange to come to the hospital with you. However, issues like distance or staffing may limit our possibilities to do so.</p>

<h2>Treatment</h2>

<p>The National Protocol for Rape and Sexual Assault Victims indicates the medical treatment that every victim must receive following a complete medical examination:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat all physical injuries appropriately (including genital injuries)</li>
  <li>provide the Emergency Contraception Pill (Also known as ‘Morning After Pill’): This pill must be taken within 72 hours of having unprotected sex. The sooner it is taken, the better chances of it being effective</li>
  <li>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) treatment:  If taken early enough (ideally within the first two hours after the exposure occurred and up to 72 hours), it is thought to stop HIV from replicating in the body thereby preventing the virus from attacking the immune system. In Spanish this treatment is called ‘Tratamiento Antirretroviral’. PEP is a four-week course of medication, but the National Protocol for Rape and Sexual Assault Victims obliges the doctors to provide the patient with the necessary tablets for a 3-day intake, as the patient must check in at the hospital again to meet with the Infectious Diseases Team for a follow-up. During this meeting, the doctor must hand out the remaining tablets to complete the four-week treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are returning to the UK immediately, the NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on your arrival.</p>

<p>If the hospital cannot provide you with the remaining tablets, the doctor must hand you a prescription. However, this medication can sometimes be hard to find and can be very expensive. Please, let us know if this is the case and we can help you contact local pharmacies or other hospitals.</p>

<p>You must NOT interrupt the PEP treatment without consulting a doctor first.</p>

<p>The Emergency Contraception pill can be purchased at any pharmacy without a medical referral or prescription.</p>

<p>The National Protocol for Rape and Sexual Assault Victims indicates that the entire assistance response (including medical examinations, tests and treatments) are free of charge in public hospitals. Please be aware that private hospitals may expect you to pay for their intervention.</p>

<p>If you have had medication administered overseas, you may wish to keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home.</p>

<h2>Police investigations in  Argentina – what to expect</h2>

<p>Once you have made a statement and undergone a medical examination, the information will be sent by the police to the investigating court.</p>

<p>It is not common practice to ask the victim to visit the scene of the crime when a rape or sexual assault is being investigated.</p>

<p>The police will aim to avoid any contact between the victim and the suspect as this may void a future identity parade during the legal proceedings. Only a Judge can request an identity parade further on in an investigation.</p>

<p>If the police make an arrest, the court will be notified within the hour of the arrest. The Judge will have 24 hours to meet the suspect and take the suspect’s statement before deciding whether to prosecute or not. Depending on the province where the incident takes place, this responsibility can be delegated to the prosecutor directly.</p>

<p>You will be asked to ratify your declaration of events in front of the Judge or the Prosecutor (depending the province where the crime was perpetrated). This means you may have to talk through the details and course of the events one more time. You are free to leave the country whenever you please. Just note that doing so before ratifying your statement in front of the Judge or Prosecutor, can signify the immediate closure of the investigation and filing of the case. After you have ratified your statement, there is no need for you to stay in country while the legal process develops (see below).</p>

<h2>Court procedures – what to expect</h2>

<p>Throughout the course of the investigation, the Judge has the power to call you as a witness for further statements. This call constitutes an obligation to attend. If you are in the UK, the Judge can issue letters requisitorial to the relevant authority in the UK to assist in taking your declaration.</p>

<p>If the Judge considers that, given the seriousness of the crime being investigated and the relevance of your testimony, your testimony must happen in person, you can request financial compensation for the costs incurred to travel.</p>

<p>Having a lawyer will enable you to be kept aware of the case. The Court has no obligation to inform you of the case evolvements if you have not been registered as a formal complainant with formal legal representation.</p>

<p>After you have ratified your statement in front of the Judge or Prosecutor, it becomes an automatic state prosecution, meaning the Court will have the power to investigate even if this is not your wish.</p>

<p>Argentine Criminal Law foresees sanctions for those who make false accusations against someone.   You can file a civil lawsuit against the offender to receive payment in compensation for any injuries or losses. This can be filed within the same criminal case or separately.  In Argentina, there is currently no state-funded compensation scheme to cover physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a violent crime.</p>

<p>Argentine judicial procedures can be lengthy and drawn out especially if your assailant is not immediately identifiable and/or arrested soon after the assault. An investigating judge or prosecutor is principally in charge of leading the investigation into the assault. At the end of the investigation phase when all necessary reports and statements have been completed the judge in charge of the investigation will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go trial. If so, the case will be passed to a trial court.</p>

<p>The trial will be conducted in Spanish and you will be provided with an interpreter when you are asked questions about your statement.</p>

<p>Cases can take years to come to trial, as the Argentine court system is very slow. If you haven’t heard anything from the court from some time, this does not necessarily mean that the case has been filed. The length of the trial itself can also vary depending on the complexity of the circumstances.</p>

<p>If convicted the assailant has the right of appeal against the length of the sentence which can take between one and two years to be resolved.</p>

<h2>When you return home to the UK</h2>

<p>Read our advice on <a class="govuk-link" href="www.gov.uk/government/publications/rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad-returning-to-the-uk">returning to the UK following rape and sexual assault abroad.</a></p>

<p>You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice.</p>

<p>If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually-transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you, even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in. 
The local Police will not inform the UK Police what has happened to you.</p>

<p>SARC (Sexual Assault Referral Centres) offer medical, practical and emotional support. They have specially trained professionals who can give you medical help and advice. They can also help and support you through your immediate trauma. Find your nearest SARC online.</p>

<p>It is your choice to let people know. If you are ready to talk about it the following organisations may be able to help you.</p>
