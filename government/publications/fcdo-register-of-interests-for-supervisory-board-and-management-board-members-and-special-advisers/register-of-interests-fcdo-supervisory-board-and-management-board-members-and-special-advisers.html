<p>Updated September 2022</p>

<p>The FCDO’s special advisers, Supervisory Board and Management Board members are required to declare private interests, financial or otherwise, which might present a conflict or be perceived to arise while performing public duty.</p>

<p>This register of interests is updated regularly with any new interests which must be disclosed by members, following best practice in meeting the requirements set out in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>paragraph 4.15 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/corporate-governance-code-for-central-government-departments-2017">Corporate governance in central departments: code of good practice</a> (April 2017)</li>
  <li>paragraph 4.3 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-conduct-for-board-members-of-public-bodies/code-of-conduct-for-board-members-of-public-bodies-june-2019#conflicts-of-interest">Code of Conduct for Board Members of Public Bodies</a> (June 2019)</li>
  <li>paragraph 6.4.3 of the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-financial-reporting-manual-2020-21">Government Financial Reporting Manual (FReM)</a> (December 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p>Board members are expected to remove themselves from any discussion where there might be a risk of bias or financial interest.</p>

<p>In line with the above, all special advisers, Supervisory Board and Management Board members have declared any relevant interests or confirmed they do not consider they have any relevant interests. The Accounting Officer has considered these returns and the following relevant interests are set out in public.</p>

<h2>Supervisory Board</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Rt Hon&nbsp;James Cleverly MP (Chair)</li>
  <li>Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon</li>
  <li>Leo Docherty MP</li>
  <li>Vicky Ford MP</li>
  <li>The Rt Hon Lord Zac Goldsmith</li>
  <li>The Rt Hon Jesse Norman MP</li>
  <li>Gillian Keegan MP</li>
</ul>

<p>All MPs have an entry on the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/" rel="external">House of Commons Register of Members’ Financial Interests</a> on the UK Parliament website.</p>
