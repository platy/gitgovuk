<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this guidance is to set out the expectations for and conditions under which the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) will support students via the 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation in the academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>This should be read alongside the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 education: funding guidance</a>, of which this guide is a part of.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>Overview</h2>
<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) 16 to 19 tuition fund is specifically allocated funding for all 16 to 19 institutions who receive annual funding allocations from ESFA for the provision of 16 to 19 education, to mitigate the disruption to learning due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>The funding is available to all 16 to 19 institutions.</p>

<p>This fund is targeted at students in most need, offering small group tuition to recover lost learning. On 27 October 2021, we announced the introduction of 40 additional hours, which is in addition to the tuition fund.</p>

<p>Additional hours will support all students to help ensure gaps in learning caused by disruption to education are bridged and is aimed at uplifting hours to bring us closer to high performing international comparator countries.</p>

<p>You can find more information on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes#monitoring-and-reporting-on-additional-hours">additional hours</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Changes for 2022 to 2023</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Additional flexibilities</h3>

<p>Students who have not achieved a grade 6 in English and/or maths at age 16 will be eligible to receive tuition support.</p>

<p>Students who meet the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund eligibility criteria will be eligible to receive tuition support, even where they do not meet the current eligibility criteria of living in the 27% most economically deprived areas of the country (based on the index of multiple deprivation). Students with high prior attainment who are eligible for the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund can receive tuition support, if it is needed for them to reach their full potential.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Opt in process to the fund</h3>
<p>Institutions in receipt of the academic year 2021 to 2022 16 to 19 tuition fund will automatically have their allocation renewed (auto renewal) with the option to opt out using the digital form if they wish to.</p>

<p>Institutions delivering tuition support funded from their academic year 2020 to 2021 allocation but who are not in receipt of tuition funding for academic year 2021 to 2022 are not eligible for auto renewal.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Requirements and accountability</h3>

<p>Institutions will not be required to publish a statement of intent on how they intend to deliver the fund.</p>

<p>Institutions will be required to submit an end of year financial report that will include a declaration of expenditure and how it has been spent for the academic year 2022 to 2023, and confirmation that expenditure meets the conditions of funding and is accurate.</p>

<p>To reduce the administrative burden on institutions, this will be an addendum to the end of year report required for the additional <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes/16-to-19-funding-additional-hours-in-study-programmes">40 hours</a>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.4 </span>Institution eligibility</h3>
<p>All institutions that receive annual funding allocations from ESFA for the provision of 16 to 19 education are eligible. This includes institutions that receive funding for disadvantage block 1 (DB1) economic deprivation funding and/or disadvantage block 2 (DB2).</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.5 </span>Student eligibility</h3>
<p>All students must be on a 16 to 19 study programme or T Level and the funding should be used to support the tuition activity above and beyond the programmes of education already planned.</p>

<p>The following students are eligible for funding via the 16 to 19 tuition fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with low prior attainment, meaning those who did not have a GCSE grade 4 or above in English and/or maths at age 16 and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students that have not achieved a grade 6 in English and/or maths at age 16 and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students from the 27% most economically deprived areas of the country (based on the index of multiple deprivation) and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students that are economically disadvantaged who meet the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund eligibility criteria and would need catch-up support to reach their full potential will be eligible, even where their prior attainment is high</li>
  <li>students aged 19 to 24 who have an education, health, and care (EHC) plan are also eligible for support, subject to meeting the eligibility for the fund</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.6 </span>Prioritising eligible students for tuition support</h3>
<p>When identifying who needs support through the tuition fund based on low prior attainment, institutions should prioritise tuition for those students who have not achieved a grade 4 in maths and/or English in the first instance.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.7 </span>Activities supported by the fund</h3>
<p>The fund supports students that meet eligibility requirements in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>small groups and one to one tuition</li>
  <li>tuition in English, maths/other academic subjects</li>
  <li>tuition in non-academic subjects, such as exam preparation</li>
  <li>tuition in vocational courses</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions must consider what will be most effective for their eligible students, considering students’ needs and local circumstances.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.8 </span>Additional activities supported by the fund for special education needs and disabilities (SEND) students and students aged 19 to 24 with an EHC plan</h3>
<p>In addition to general activities supported by the fund, for eligible SEND students and those with EHC plans aged 19 to 24, the fund can also be used to provide pastoral support including mental health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Institutions should have regard to the needs of SEND students, particularly where they have experienced additional disruption to learning because of their specific needs and disabilities.</p>

<p>Institutions may choose to use this funding to support eligible learners with SEND to catch up on vocational and academic skills, and skills and learning that are important for their preparation for adulthood.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.9 </span>Small group tuition</h3>
<p>The funding should be used to support tuition costs only; that is the actual staff costs of delivering catch-up tuition, or the costs of contracting/commissioning a third party. This could include essential record keeping complying with the fund requirements. It should not include costs such as diagnostic tools, room hire, equipment, laptops, transport, or stationery.</p>

<p>This does not apply to eligible SEND students and those with EHC plans aged 19 to 24 because of the additional activities supported by the fund.</p>

<h4>Group sizes</h4>

<p>Small groups are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>up to 5 students</li>
  <li>in exceptional circumstances, this may be extended to up to 7 students</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Group sizes over 7 will not be eligible for support from this fund.</p>
</div>

<p>Examples of exceptional circumstances include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>where workshop space is at a premium</li>
  <li>if the absence of a member of staff requires the merger of 2 existing groups on a temporary basis</li>
  <li>where a specialist staff member has limited availability</li>
</ul>

<p>Institutions should be mindful of the quality of provision when extending group size. You can refer to the <a class="govuk-link" href="#quality-of-provision">quality of provision</a> section.</p>

<h4>Delivery</h4>
<p>More than one group can be held in the same space.</p>

<p>In these circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the groups must be clearly defined</li>
  <li>each group must have their own tutor</li>
  <li>the space must be conducive to multiple small group activity</li>
</ul>

<h4>Resourcing (staffing)</h4>
<p>Institutions can decide how to resource the delivery of small group tuition supported through the fund. This may include a mix of both teaching and learning support staff, as appropriate.</p>

<p>Institutions must ensure that anyone delivering small group tuition has the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience, and has received appropriate training where necessary.</p>

<p>Resourcing could be through paying for more hours from existing staff, hiring new staff, or buying in a service from a third-party provider. Where a third-party is used for all or part of delivery, ESFA subcontracting rules do not apply.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">4. </span>Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.1 </span>Quality of provision</h3>
<p>Institutions should have regard for the quality of their tutoring provision. Evidence suggests that small group tuition works better with the smallest groups, and when the tuition is focused on students’ specific needs and is linked to classroom learning. Training and tutor support are also likely to increase the effectiveness of small group tutoring, providing the best possible outcomes for students.</p>

<p>Good examples of how the tuition fund has been used include institutions utilising a mixture of small group and one-to-one tuition focused on students they have identified as having significant gaps in their learning. In addition, some institutions have used the fund to hire specific subject specialist staff to provide targeted support in areas such as maths and English, and vocational areas.</p>

<p>The Education Endowment Foundation has <a class="govuk-link" href="https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evidence-summaries/teaching-learning-toolkit/small-group-tuition/#effectiveness" rel="external">published a toolkit</a> which institutions may find useful.</p>

<p>The toolkit provides extra information on small group tuition, including links to related resources.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">4.2 </span>Support from a third-party provider (buying in a service)</h3>
<p>Institutions remain responsible at all times for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the quality of provision</li>
  <li>student health and wellbeing</li>
  <li>managing the funding, allocated in line with the conditions of funding and controls and accountability requirements</li>
  <li>record keeping</li>
  <li>providing ESFA and DfE with management information as required</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">5. </span>Funding</h2>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.1 </span>Funding conditions</h3>
<p>Institutions that opt into the tuition fund through the digital form or do not opt out, where this will result in auto renewal, agree to the terms and conditions of the 16 to 19 tuition funding as set out in this guidance and the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/16-to-19-education-funding-guidance">16 to 19 education: funding guidance</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Institutions that wish to opt out of the fund for 2022 to 2023 should do so via the digital form no later than Friday 27 May 2022.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.2 </span>Eligible spend</h3>

<p>Funding should be used as set out in this guidance for eligible students only and prioritised as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#prioritising-eligible-students">prioritising eligible students section</a>.</p>

<p>Funding should be used to support tuition costs and for additional activities (as set out in activities supported by the fund) for SEND students and those with EHC plans aged 19 to 24.</p>

<p>The fund is to be used for actual staff costs to deliver catch up tuition or the costs of contracting/commissioning a third-party. This could include essential record keeping to comply with the requirements of the fund and should not include costs such as diagnostic tools, room hire, equipment, laptops, transport, or stationery.</p>

<p>Expenditure for additional activities for SEND students and those with EHC plans must have a well-defined rationale with clear evidence of need that is justifiable and relevant to the additional disruption experienced by the student.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">5.3 </span>Record keeping</h3>
<p>Record in the individualised learner records (ILR) and the schools census students who have received tuition support activities funded through the 16 to 19 tuition fund.</p>

<p>The code to identify tuition fund activities in the ILR can be found via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/22-23/ilr/entity/LearnerFAM/field/LearnFAMType/attribute/NLM" rel="external">National learner monitoring: attribute field guidance</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the Provider Support Manual for 2022 to 2023 which includes <a class="govuk-link" href="https://guidance.submit-learner-data.service.gov.uk/psm" rel="external">guidance for completing the ILR</a>.</p>

<p>You can also refer to the learner funding and monitoring (FAM) section of our guidance on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/complete-the-school-census/data-items-2022-to-2023">how to complete the school census</a>.</p>

<p>Record the use of the funding, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>whether a third-party is being used for delivery</li>
  <li>reference to the individual students that receive the support</li>
  <li>the needs of those students</li>
  <li>the number of hours of tuition delivered</li>
</ul>

<p>Ensure you retain the necessary evidence of the tuition provided and additional cost. Institutions will need this information to complete the end of year report.</p>

<p>You must deliver the extra tuition and spend the associated funding in the 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>Failure to meet these conditions may incur recovery of ineligible spend. The 16 to 19 tuition fund is subject to normal assurance arrangements for 16 to 19 education and training.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="number">6. </span>Controls and accountability requirements</h2>
<p>We have a responsibility to make sure that public funds are managed properly, in line with your grant funding agreement. These requirements form part of the conditions of funding.</p>

<p>Institutions will be required to demonstrate that all funding has been administered in accordance with grant funding agreements, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funding has supported additional small group tuition for students aged 16 to 19 (or students aged 19 to 24 with an EHC plan) in English, maths, or other courses where learning has been disrupted</li>
  <li>the retention of original documents relating to the delivery of tuition support and the disbursement of all tuition funding including student enrolment and attendance records and learning agreement - institutions will be required to produce original documents as part of the assurance process</li>
</ul>

<p>Provide ESFA and DfE with management information as required. This may include submitting a mid-year report on spend and a forecast for end of year spend.</p>

<p>This would be for monitoring purposes only, and not an exercise in which ESFA will seek to reduce your in-year allocation.</p>

<p>Institutions will be required to submit an end of year financial report that will include a declaration of expenditure for the academic year 2022 to 2023 and confirm that expenditure meets the conditions of funding and is accurate.</p>

<p>You are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ensure expenditure is incurred and covered in line with this guidance by 31 July 2023</li>
  <li>ensure the prompt return to ESFA of unspent allocated funds - more information about the recovery process will be released separately in June</li>
  <li>comply and co-operate with assurance activities - DfE has the right to request evidence/documents to support expenditure and activities of tuition fund allocations</li>
  <li>identify the 16 to 19 Tuition Fund as a separate budget line in your institution’s audited accounts</li>
</ul>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>ESFA will recover funds where spend is found not to be in line with the conditions of the funding or where auditors identify funding errors in any circumstances where the institution is not able to demonstrate at audit how their students or tuition meet the eligibility criteria of the tuition fund.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Ofsted</h3>
<p>Ofsted may take account of small group tuition funded by the 16 to 19 tuition fund through interim visits and through full inspection.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Local authorities</h3>
<p>Local authorities are responsible for the assurance of tuition funding for local authority-controlled providers and maintained schools with sixth forms.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to delay or withhold payments if data is inaccurate or incomplete. In the event of any variances, we reserve the right to ask you for explanations of these and to seek further information. Insufficient evidence and/or ineligible spend may be recovered.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Auto renewal</h3>
<p>Auto renewal is available only to those institutions in receipt of academic year 2021 to 2022 16 to 19 tuition funding. These institutions have the option to ‘do nothing’ and will receive confirmation from ESFA they are eligible for auto renewal and will automatically receive their 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation for academic year 2022 to 2023.</p>

<p>Institutions delivering tuition support funded from their academic year 2020 to 2021 allocation but who are not in receipt of tuition funding for academic year 2021 to 2022 are not eligible for auto renewal.</p>

<p>ESFA will confirm by email to individual institutions at the end of March they are eligible for auto renewal. Institutions that do not wish to be auto renewed and do not wish to have their 2022 to 2023 tuition funding should opt out via the digital form no later than Friday, 27 May 2022.</p>

<p>Auto renewal institutions will continue to have access to an individualised digital form which will contain details of their indicative allocation. Institutions may also choose to confirm that they do not wish to opt out of the fund to receive a confirmation email from ESFA that they are opted into the fund.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>If your organisation does not wish to auto renew and receive their 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation for 2022 to 2023, you will need to opt out through the digital form no later than Friday, 27 May 2022.</p>
</div>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Opting into the fund for 2022 to 2023</h3>
<p>Institutions not in receipt of an academic year 2021 to 2022 16 to 19 tuition fund allocation that wish to receive 16 to 19 tuition funding in academic year 2022 to 2023 will be required to opt in using the digital form which will contain your academic year 2022 to 2023 allocation offer.</p>

<p>To use this facility, you will need access to your institution’s <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a> account.</p>

<p>If your DfE Sign-in account is associated with more than one organisation, you must select the individual school or college from the list presented on the ‘Select your organisation’ page. This will then provide you with access to the digital form.</p>

<p>If the individual organisation is not displayed, you would need to find out who within your organisation has approver permissions for DfE Sign-in and they can add or remove a user.</p>

<p>If you cannot find who has approver access, your CEO/CFO or business manager can raise an incident via DfE Sign-in.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.5 </span>Opting out of the fund for 2022 to 2023</h3>
<p>All institutions, including those eligible for auto renewal, that do not wish to receive their allocation are expected to opt out using the digital form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.6 </span>Opt in/out window</h3>
<p>There will be two windows of opportunity for institutions to opt into the fund and accept their allocation offer or to opt out and decline their allocation offer.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage all eligible institutions to start this process as early as possible. In the event of unforeseen difficulties, this will allow sufficient time for these to be addressed and avoid institutions missing the closing date.</p>

<p>Institutions should be aware that opting into the fund in October will mean payments will be made after the start of the academic year.</p>

<h4>Window 1</h4>
<p>Opens 8am, Monday, 9 May 2022 and will close at 11:59pm on Friday, 27 May 2022.</p>

<h4>Window 2</h4>
<p>Opens 8am, Monday, 3 October 2022 and will close at 11:59pm on Friday, 21 October 2022.</p>

<h4>Outstanding 16-19 allocations</h4>
<p>It is possible that a minority of institutions will not have had their 16 to 19 allocation confirmed prior to the first opt in window, meaning they are unable to receive a 16 to 19 tuition fund offer in window 1. To accommodate this, a second window is scheduled for October 2022.</p>

<p>In the rare event that an institution has not had their 16 to 19 allocation confirmed in time for the October window, ESFA will work with institutions on an individual basis should they wish to take up their allocation, once the amount is confirmed.</p>

<p>For some institutions the level of the 16 to 19 tuition fund shown in the digital form may change. This would be where a successful business case that adjusts any of the elements in their 16 to 19 allocation used to calculate the tuition fund changes.</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>funded students</li>
  <li>funding band proportions - DB1 or DB2.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these instances, the final tuition fund value will be adjusted to reflect the change. The final tuition funding will be confirmed in a revised 16 to 19 allocation statement, once processed.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.7 </span>Notification</h3>
<p>ESFA will announce in the ESFA Update when the tuition fund allocations have been processed. This will be after institutions have received a confirmed 16 to 19 allocation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>May 2022 window - no later than week commencing 27 June 2022</li>
  <li>October 2022 window - no later than week commencing 21 November 2022</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">6.8 </span>Payments</h3>
<p>Payment of the 16 to 19 tuition fund will be made through your 16 to 19 funding allocation. Institutions will receive payment as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>May 2022 window - payments will commence from the start of the 2022 to 2023 academic year</li>
  <li>October 2022 window - payments will commence no earlier than December 2022</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="number">7. </span>Allocations for 2022 to 2023</h2>
<p>The tuition fund allocation will be shown in the digital form. This value will align to the 16 to 19 allocation shared with institutions ahead of the digital form going live.</p>

<p>For institutions that auto renew or opt in to receive the fund their final allocation will reflect any changes made as a result of a successful 16 to 19 business case affecting funded students, DB1 or DB2. The final allocation value will be communicated via a revised 16 to 19 allocation statement.</p>

<p>Allocations will continue to be based on the two proxy measures set out below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with low prior attainment, meaning those who did not have a GCSE grade 4 or above in English and/or maths at age 16</li>
  <li>students from the 27% most economically deprived areas of the country based on the index of multiple deprivation</li>
</ul>

<p>However, institutions will have the ability to also use allocations for students eligible for the new flexibilities as detailed in the <a class="govuk-link" href="#changes-for-2022-to-2023">changes for 2022 to 2023 section</a>.</p>

<p>To calculate the number of instances per student from the 27% most economically deprived areas, we have counted the number of students funded in academic year 2020 to 2021 with a DB1 uplift, and divided it by the total number of funded students in academic year 2020 to 2021.</p>

<p>Institutions will be able to see this data in their 2022 to 2023 allocation and calculation toolkit (ACT) file. The ‘Programme’ sheet shows the disadvantage uplift factor for each student in the ‘uplift factor’ column.</p>

<p>If a student is not eligible for block 1 disadvantage funding, the ‘Uplift Factor’ column shows 1.0000 and the ‘Disadvantage Instance’ column shows a 0. Students identified as ‘funded’ are marked with a ‘Yes’ in the ‘Funded Student’ column. The final calculated DB1 instances per student is shown in the ‘Funding Elements’ sheet of the ACT file.</p>

<p>To calculate the total 2022 to 2023 instances for tuition funding, the instances per student from an institution’s ACT file, are multiplied by the number of 2022 to 2023 funded students as notified to institutions in their 2022 to 2023 16 to 19 funding statement.</p>

<p>The higher, lower and FTE instances are calculated using 2022 to 2023 funding band proportions also shown in the 16 to 19 funding statement. Where an institution delivers T Levels, T Level instances have been included with the higher rate instances.</p>

<p>For institutions without 2020 to 2021 academic year data, we have used an average for the local authority area in which the institution is based, using local authority level instances per student for institutions funded in 2022 to 2023 academic year.</p>

<p>For those with no local authority average data, a national average for each institution category has been used. Whilst the DB1 uplift factor varies depending on the range of deprivation, for the purposes of tuition funding we have not included any variation.</p>

<p>The calculation of the DB2 element of 16 to 19 tuition funding is based on the figures in an institution’s 2022 to 2023 16 to 19 funding statement and the English and maths instances data in the ‘programme’ sheet of the ACT file.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">8. </span>Rates</h2>
<p>Institutions will receive £100 per instance for students in bands 4, 5 and above and £60 for students in the lower bands. An individual student may attract more than 1 instance dependent upon their circumstances in accordance with the measures used to calculate the allocation.</p>

<p>The tables below provide an example of how we will calculate the 16 to 19 tuition fund.</p>
