<h2>
<span class="number">1. </span>Introduction</h2>
<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) 16 to 19 tuition fund was first provided for the 2020 to 2021 academic year and is being extended up to the 2023 to 2024 academic year.</p>

<p>These instructions provide guidance so you can opt in to, or out of, the 16 to 19 tuition fund for the academic year 2022 to 2023.  If you received tuition funding in 2021 to 2022, then you are eligible for the auto renewal process and will only be able to opt out using the form.</p>

<p>You are not required to complete the form if you wish to opt in to continue to receiving tuition funding in 2022 to 2023. However, you can complete the form if you would like an email confirming you have opted in to the auto-renewal process.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">1.1 </span>Considerations for students</h3>
<p>The following students are eligible for funding via the 16 to 19 tuition fund:</p>

<ul>
  <li>students with low prior attainment, meaning those who did not have a GCSE grade 4 or above in English and/or maths at age 16 and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students that have not achieved a grade 6 in English and/or maths at age 16 and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students from the 27% most economically deprived areas of the country (based on the index of multiple deprivation) and would need catch-up support</li>
  <li>students that are economically disadvantaged who meet the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund eligibility criteria and would need catch-up support to reach their full potential will be eligible, even where their prior attainment is high</li>
  <li>students aged 19 to 24 who have an education, health, and care (EHC) plan are also eligible for support, subject to meeting the eligibility for the fund</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information read the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-16-to-19-tuition-fund/coronavirus-covid-19-16-to-19-tuition-fund-guidance-2022-to-2023">coronavirus (COVID-19) 16 to 19 tuition fund guidance on GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">2. </span>When to complete your submission</h2>
<p>The deadline to complete this form is 11:59pm on Friday, 27 May 2022.</p>

<h2>
<span class="number">3. </span>Accessing the form</h2>
<p>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/tuition-fund" rel="external">form</a> to opt in or opt out of the 2022 to 2023 tuition fund.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Before you start</h3>
<p>Make sure you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read this guidance document</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk" rel="external">a DfE Sign-in account</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.2 </span> Accessing the form</h3>

<h4>Sign in to your DfE Sign-in account:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Access the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://form.education.gov.uk/service/tuition-fund" rel="external">16 to 19 tuition fund 2022 to 2023 form</a>.</li>
  <li>Sign in using your DfE Sign-in account information (your username and password).</li>
  <li>Choose the organisation for which you are completing the form.</li>
  <li>If you are part of an FE college or a multi-academy trust and have more than one eligible campus or institute, please choose the individual campus/institute you want to complete the form for.</li>
  <li>The next page will display the details we hold about the organisation you selected when you logged in. This will show the name, address, and unique reference number (URN) or UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) of the organisation, as well as the name and email address of the person who logged in via DfE Sign-in.</li>
  <li>If these details are correct, select ‘continue’ to move to the next page.</li>
  <li>If you believe your details incorrect or you are experiencing issues accessing the form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a> and we will investigate.</li>
  <li>Complete the form as instructed in the following sections.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your account must be connected to the organisation you are registering interest for.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>You do not need to add any services in DfE Sign-in. It is used for authentication only and the form will not appear in your list of services.</p>
</div>

<p>If your DfE Sign-in account is associated with more than one organisation, you must select the individual school or college from the list presented on the ‘Select your organisation’ page, which will allow you to access to the form.</p>

<p>If the individual organisation is not displayed, you would need to find out who within your organisation has approver permissions for DfE Sign-in, and they can add or remove a user.</p>

<p>If you cannot find who has approver access, your CEO/CFO or business manager can raise an incident via <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us" rel="external">DfE Sign-in Service Desk</a>.</p>

<h4>If you do not have a DfE Sign-in account</h4>

<p>You will need to create one: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Access <a class="govuk-link" href="https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/" rel="external">DfE Sign-in</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the ‘create a DfE Sign-in account’.</li>
  <li>Enter your name and a valid business email address, which also contains your name</li>
  <li>We will send you an email to verify your email address. Copy the code from this email and paste it into the box on the verification page.</li>
  <li>Create a memorable password of a minimum of 8 characters, which must include 2 upper case letters, 2 lower case letters and 2 numbers.</li>
  <li>Sign in using your new credentials, select ‘organisations’ and then ‘request an organisation’, enter the URN or name of your establishment. The request will be sent to the DfE Sign-in approver for the establishment, to approve your request.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might have noticed the term ‘approver’ when creating your account. An approver is someone at your organisation responsible for controlling who has access to DfE Sign-in and the services within the system. It’s usually a senior person, such as an administrator or a manager.</p>

<p>Once your request to access an organisation has been approved, you can follow the steps outlined in <a class="govuk-link" href="#sign-in-to-your-DfE-Sign-in-account">sign into your DfE Sign-in account</a> to complete the form.</p>

<p>For security reasons, you will need the approval of one of your organisation’s approvers before you can access the form.</p>

<h3>
<span class="number">3.3 </span> If you need further assistance </h3>

<p>If you are having problems using the DfE Sign-in service, use our <a class="govuk-link" href="https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us" rel="external">DfE Sign-in help service</a>. You will be able to request further assistance if required. When raising a support request, select ‘other.’</p>

<p>If you believe you are eligible to claim but have problems accessing the form, contact us via the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://esfahelp.education.gov.uk/hc/en-gb" rel="external">ESFA help centre</a>.</p>
